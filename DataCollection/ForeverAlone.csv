1jt9bk9,A girl called me handsome,"Part-vent part-success story

I was voicing my doubts to my best friend that my crush might not say ""yes"" when I ask her out, especially since her type is ""tall and handsome"" and I'm not one of those. (I'm average looking and no girl has shown interest in me since high school 2017)

My best friend disagreed and she said ""No, you are handsome."" I told her I wish many girls shared the same opinion.

But I also thought to myself that she's my best friend, of course she's not gonna say I'm plain-looking. (actually, I think some best friends would actually say to your face you are ugly lol)

So I doubted if she was being genuine or just being a bro as I am indeed convinced that it is absolutely looks are why no one is interested in me. When I look at myself in the mirror, even when I dress well and groom myself, I only see an average plain-looking dude. I am also 5'6 or 167 cm. I don't really care about height these days anymore though so I won't discuss further.

I am also not socially awkward or anxious. I am extroverted and talkative and most of my friends and close friends are women. Some of them also say I am funny. I also have good hygiene.

This is why I see typical normie advice such as ""looks don't matter much"", ""be friends with women"", ""be funny"", ""take a shower"", and ""have a good personality"" as disingenuous because I do all that and still end up not attractive.

In spite of all thise, I feel happy and uplifited since I don't remember the last time a girl or woman called me handsome (even my mom doesn't and she mocks me sometimes). It gave me confidence to ask my crush out. I hope she says ""yes"" and I can finally leave this sub.

1jkd01h,"From stuck and alone to something better – it can happen, I promise you","I want to say something to anyone here who’s feeling lost, hopeless, or just… done with trying.

Not from a place of judgement—but from experience.

There was a time I couldn’t attract the kind of women I really wanted to be with. I was awkward, stuck in a career that didn’t inspire me, lacking confidence, and quietly resentful of the world—and of myself.

I didn’t have some magic moment or overnight success story. I just kept going. I kept trying. I looked outward. I stayed open. I tried to love myself—even when I didn’t feel lovable—and I tried to love others, even when I didn’t feel loved back.

And over time, things changed. Slowly. But they changed.

If there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that wallowing in bitterness and blame never brought me closer to connection. But taking action did. Walking. Running. Getting involved in things. Reaching out. Saying yes. Trying new things. Building things. Helping others. Failing. Learning. Failing again.

I want to say something that might sting—but might also free you: You’re not broken. You’re just stuck. And you don’t have to stay stuck.

You’re not doomed to be alone forever. But you do have to start moving. Not toward someone else—but toward yourself. Toward the version of you that you respect. The version of you who’s emotionally strong, curious, generous, and growing.

Beware the voices that tell you to hate women, or society. That energy might feel powerful—but it keeps you locked in pain. People like Andrew Tate? They aren’t your friend. Even the “positive” stuff he says is tied up in poison, and too many people can’t separate the two.

If you want power—real power—build yourself. Step outside. Get uncomfortable. Try. Fail. Connect. Volunteer. Join something. Lift yourself up, not so you can dominate others, but so you can meet others where they are, as an equal.

You don’t have to be perfect. You just have to begin.

1jj1eva,"I woke up one day recently and realised I felt content. I felt like, although I wasn't there yet, I had grown to the point where I felt enough. Making this write-up about my core experiences, and my progress from start to finish, hoping it might help someone else here.","Weeelll... to be honest, that's just part of it. I doubt more than a handful of people will even read this. Maybe the automod will straight-up filter it out. Some of you will probably feel like this is more empty, self-aggrandising wank written by normies who want to gloat about their success. But maybe someone will recognise themselves in my experiences. And writing swathes of text is just really cathartic. So if this helps even one person, I'm happy. **Tl;dr at the bottom.**

A few things to preface this write-up: I'm not in some glamorous place, living it up with my harem after I miraculously grew ten inches in more ways than one, if that's your idea of success. I'm still broke, struggling and in college, don't like talking to people and by society's account ""a loser"", but none of that matters to me the way it did before. Also, I'm a 25-year old brown guy, so my experiences might not align with all the people on the FA spectrum. Also also, it's up to you to decide if I was ever even FA, since that already is a pretty abstract label. Nonetheless, it's how I felt. Didn't have any severe physical shortcomings, other than being pretty short, but not really any ""attractive"" features either. And I was soul-crushingly lonely

I first realised I was FA when I was 19. After a series of specific experiences, I realised I had no idea who I was, who I wanted to be, how I got here, what goals to outline, how I wanted to achieve them, etc., etc. I had no life skills to speak of, barely made it through high school, little social skills and barely any real life experience. Feelings of aimlessness and lackadaisicality were always there in my subconcious, but were silenced with a little voice, deluding myself into thinking that everything will work out fine in the end. But seeing as all the ones whom I thought were like me were now moving on with their life, onto bigger and better things, I looked at myself in the mirror and thought...

##I am a loser...

I've always joked about it and half-heartedly thought I accepted it... but fully realising it and being forced to swallow that harsh truth felt a lot more bitter than I thought it would. My biggest dream was to find a girlfriend, but who would want someone as incapable and unlovable like me? I don't even have any cool hobbies or interests like most other FA losers, I didn't even listen to music. If there was someone out there somehow deluded enough to give me a chance, is this the version of me they'd fall madly in love with? I don't want to shirk the responsibility of becoming the best version of myself onto someone already doing me a favor by going out with a useless nobody like me. 

There's a lot more to be said about who I was and how I started figuring out how my brain worked, but this write-up is already longer than I expected, so I'll keep the following sections a lot more concise.


###The things that kickstarted my desire to change:

I refused to acknowledge that this was gonna be me for the rest of my life, whether it be because I was motivated to change, or my loser life had given me delusions of grandeur and I subconsciously looked down on people.



Since I didn't know who I was and what I wanted, I looked back on my childhood and tried remembering the things I was passionate about, and why and when I stopped caring. I realised I used to be passionate about many things; things that were deemed ""gay/unmasculine and for nerds"". Extreme pressure forced me to try and conform to expectations of masculinity, but in doing so, it had simultaneously caused me to **literally unlearn how to enjoy myself,** and made me feel like worthless for failing to ""attain"" masculinity.

I had little interest in fashion, but wanting to improve myself, I spent what little money I had on some clothes, and I built up the courage to try them on in my room. I felt so embarrassed. They were regular clothes, but still it almost felt like I was crossdressing - and that made me so mad. Why? Why, when I spent the little money that I have on myself to try on some clothes I thought might be cool, am I sitting here *in my own room*, not allowing myself to feel good about it? That anger broke me, and made me realise something I hope to instill on everyone here: **Unless there might be physical repercussions, try your best to this specific type of discomfort when exploring new ideas. You are denying yourself an infinite amount of amazing possibilities and experiences.** This was how it started for me and I now feel like I have a great fashion sense. It's really become one of my favorite creative outlets.

From that moment on, almost every time I had some kind of reaction to anything, I took a step back to think about why I had the reaction the way I did. It really revealed to me how much I wasted my energy caring about asinine stuff, both in reference to what people thought of me and what I thought of them. I realised I could be unflinchingly mean, because all my subconscious thoughts were telling me that they hated me anyway. The internet was rife with ""cringe-culture"" and I became grossed out by it overnight. ""You know what, why do I care when I could just not? These people seem a lot happier than me, that's for sure.""

###Taking action

>*Recontextualising things for yourself might help you realise that you care too much about stupid stuff, but unlearning that reaction is still extremely tough.*

This is one of the biggest positive changes I've made. The first time you try something, it feels ""cringe"", you start doubting yourself. ""Maybe they were right, this is kinda stupid,"" and you feel defeated. But if you have even the slightest feeling you wanna try again, do it. Things will be different, I promise you. Any inkling of progress helps you better understand what you want and how you want to do it. Though some things you'll still find stupid. I wanted to be more social, and now I try my best to avoid talking to people that aren't my friends. I was lucky to have a lot of free time on my hands around 19 - 21 and almost all hobbies and personality traits I've cultivated were the result of me investing more time and resources into things that piqued my interest, trying my best to muffle the little voice in me that told me I was cringe. Plenty of bad financial decisions were made, though.

I grew out my hair, despite me thinking it would look awful, and it became the biggest reason I had any confidence at all. I got an ADHD diagnosis, which helped me tremendously. For a long time, I would never have wanted to try and find out something like that. I didn't want one more flaw to add to the laundry list of things that made me a failure. But due to silencing that little voice, I allowed myself to see it for the eye-opening diagnosis that it was. I became less worried about ""feeling/looking stupid"", and instead wanted to feel proud about being knowledgeable. It made me more eager to learn about all the little things I didn't know. I used to subconsciously categorise things as ""Stuff I am capable of doing"" and ""Stuff normal people are capable of doing"". But with every little nugget of knowledge I gained, I became more aware as to how stupid that was, too. Instead, I started asking myself ""What are they doing, and what is the distance between me and them?"" I gained an enormous amount of insight because I had accepted that it's okay to not know things. And over time, every time I looked into the mirror, I saw a unique combination of attributes that I felt increasingly happier to recognise as *me*, all because I decided to ignore the what ifs. Unfortunately for me though, taking care of long hair is still a pain in the ass :')

>*If something doesn't work out, you might feel defeated, but you'll eventually forget all about it. If something does work out, it might pay out a life time of dividends. Please don't consider investing in yourself as something ""wasteful"". Do you not think you're worthy of having nicer things?*

I also finally started dating at age 20 and learnt a lot about that, too, but that's such a fustercluck of random unrelated experiences that I cba adding it to the write-up. I already got waaaayyy too invested into this lmao. If you found any of this useful, feel free to ask for whatever in the comments.

**Tl;dr:**

- **I realised my shortcomings and started working on accepting them.**

- **Accepting said shortcomings had the cascading effect of finding out just how well and truly f*cked I was (not sure if the auto-mod would let me swear).**

- **The more I learnt to accept these aspects, the less unpleasant they felt to face, and the easier it became to start changing my behaviour.**

- **Changing my behaviour not only led me to new opportunities, but also allowed me to see those opportunities from a fresh perspective.**

- **Willingly engaging in new things, regardless of how ""cringe"" it felt, or how other people might judge me for it, imbibed me with new knowledge, a lot of which I didn't know I had previously missed out on**

- **New knowledge helped me better curate my interests, allowing me to broaden my horizon while simultaneously tightening my scope onto the things I care about most.**

- **Allowing myself to learn/try more and more things helped me make bigger and better changes, which motivated to continue making change. A clearer version of my identity began to emerge.**

- **These changes, over time, put distance between the version of me that I was leaving behind, and helped me get closer to the better version of myself that I was becoming. I became increasingly happy looking into the mirror and seeing a 'me' I associated with a positive image, rather than one of failure.**",Unlovesick,9,11,Success Story,woke one day recently realised

1jw0k2d,When even your oldest friends start acting like strangers…,"I’m 22 and never had a big friend circle — just three people I actually considered real friends. No drama, no fake connections — just people I thought I could rely on.

Lately, it feels like they’ve all started pulling away.

One of them, who I’ve been distancing myself from, had this way of putting me down — subtly, but consistently. Never anything obvious, but enough to chip away at me over time. I finally started stepping back from that dynamic.

Now, it seems like he’s turned another friend against me. That second friend came back to the city recently after a long time. He didn’t even reach out when he got here, even though he told me weeks ago he’d be visiting. I met him today, and the vibe was totally off — distant, uninterested, like we were just casual acquaintances. He’s been staying at the first guy’s place this whole time, so I can guess what’s being said behind my back.

Then there’s my third friend — someone I’ve known since childhood. He’s living abroad now. I’ve tried calling and texting him a few times over the last six months. No reply, except once when he said he’s too busy to even talk to his parents. But yesterday he made time to chat with that second friend. That part stung.

I’m not someone who gets overly emotional or expects constant attention. But when the only people you actually let close start treating you like you don’t matter, it makes you question whether the friendship meant as much to them as it did to you.

I talked to my mom about it, and she thinks the manipulative one poisoned the well. Maybe. I don’t know. I’m not mad — I’m just tired of chasing people who clearly don’t feel the same way anymore.

Not sure if I’m overthinking, or if this is just how life goes. You grow up, and people you thought were solid start acting like strangers.

It annoys me because I don’t understand why someone would match only to ignore me. I hate how the apps constantly have pop ups and try to push features to me. I never subscribed to anything but I can see why the temptation is there. These companies prey on vulnerable and emotional people just to make money. They try and keep people hooked as long as possible by hiding likes and limiting swipes. There’s also shady people on there like scammers, catfishes or people trying to sell content which is not what the apps are for. There are success stories here and there but they are few and far between. What I think is the worst aspect of dating apps is the toxic culture that’s it’s spawned.

1ju67sa,Weeded Out of the Gene Pool,"I came across a video earlier tonight while I was scrolling through Instagram. It showed an alligator snapping turtle hunting fish by using its tongue as bait, opening its mouth wide and wiggling its worm-like appendage in an attempt to lure in a hungry fish. The poor scaly swimmer with the misfortune of becoming that turtle's lunch wasn't necessarily stupid: it took its time to assess the bait, swimming just far enough from the snapping turtle's mouth to get away if it needed to. But hunger got to it eventually, and it swam right into the turtle's reach and got eaten. I don't know how much conscious thought the turtle put into its hunting strategies, but I doubt that it ever considered that it has an appendage on its tongue that looks exactly like a worm. That came from natural selection. 

Natural selection is incredible. At some point a few million years ago, a turtle was born with some weird appendage with no obvious practical benefit. That appendage, so far as anyone knows, was due entirely to luck and chance, but it nevertheless turned out to have a handy purpose. Some poor fishes thought that it was a worm and practical gave themselves away to that turtle as food; that turtle was well fed and lived a long life, giving the world many, many babies. Some of those babies had that same appendage, and they were usually better fed, longer lived, and more sexually successful than their appendage-less counterparts. Then most of their babies had it, and they also outproduced their appendage-less siblings, and so on and so forth until no alligator snapping turtle without it was considered normal and healthy. It's an incredible thing. But no one seems to care about the turtles that didn't survive. 

Lately, I've felt a lot like the turtles that didn't make it through natural selection. My genes are poor for creating someone that makes an appealing partner, and that keeps me from reproducing. Maybe that's a good thing for human civilization; maybe it's best if I don't have any children and pass on my shitty genes.

I've been mocked and belittled my whole life. I was one of those scraggly emo kids and that's when the bullying started. Being asked out as a joke, having my bra exposed to be mocked, being called flatty or asking me if i was trans because I was so flat. 

I feel completely miserable and unlovable. It seems everyone assumes that girls will always get a ton of attention and love and can always get a partner no matter what. I know I probably could find a boyfriend if i really wanted to. But he wouldn't actually want to be with me, or would only be with me to be with a young woman, not because he was actually attracted to me. I would be used and then dumped for the next best thing. 

I don't even know what I'd do in a hypothetical relationship. How do I kiss? When are we supposed to have sex? God forbid, how do I even do *that*?? I feel so behind everyone else my age. I don't know how to do things that other girls know how to do. What guy would give me the time of day as some shy, awkward virgin, when he could be with a girl who was a million times hotter, smarter, funnier, more social, and good in bed. 

I'm have so little confidence and self love that I feel like my biggest bully is myself. I have no friends outside of a few online ones. My life is just school, work, and then home. My best friend is my cat. 

What am I going to do? I want to find a way to be happy by myself. I like being alone. But feeling lonely is the worst. I feel like less of a woman and like something must be horribly wrong with me for no one to ever like me. I like women, too, but none of them give me the time of day either.

I was obviously really excited, organised everything and cleaned my flat. Then on the morning of valentines day she texts me that she's not feeling well. I felt like shit. It sounded like the cheapest excuse you could come up with. I played along tough as I still couldn't believe that after always showing interest suddenly she would dump me like that. So I wrote with her and wished her the best. and then on Sunday two days later she wrote that she can't imagine a relationship with me but we can be friends.

I declined politely and indicated that I didn't think she was very tactful with her excuse and left it at that.

1jsyy1r,"Virgin 28M, never kissed or had a girlfriend","I just don't understand it. I don't understand it. I wish things had turned out differently. But here I am at 28 years old. I just wish I knew what a kiss felt like. I just want to be able to be intimate with someone. I just want someone to love me. Why is that so hard to find? My dad tells me ""let her come to you, she'll come to you in time."" But he's been saying that for the past decade. That's all he does. He doesn't actually help me meet people. Whenever I explain how I feel to him, he just gets agitated and babbles on about how lonely he feels too, which doesn't make me feel any better. Literally nothing has happened romantically or even like finding a friend who is a woman, in my life at all. No one really seems to care, no one cares.

Nothing is happening and nothing is going to happen. I'm done pretending, I'm done hoping. The only thing I want is the answer why, and I don't know. I have no opportunities to meet people. From some small town in the US. I work from home full-time. Dating apps don't work. I am a Christian and have tried Upward for months. I swipe right on every single profile I see, like 200 swipes a day. I get a few, maybe 2 likes a day when I do this, that are literally all comprised of unattractive or overweight women that I just don't feel attracted to. I'm not bashing them. It's just not my thing. And even when I do message them on the app, which I do even though I don't feel attracted to them - because you might as well try, right? - they never respond. I'm not asking for a movie star - just someone who looks even somewhat decent. What is wrong with me, why are girls repulsed from me? Why do they immediately lose interest in me as soon as they see me? What is it about me? I just don't understand it.

I tried eHarmony, which is a scam and no one replied to me on that platform either. It's like the site is dead. I'm not into hookups, so I don't use Tinder. And I tried ChristianMingle to no avail. I don't know what to do. I don't think there's anything I can do. 

I just want someone who cares about me, will reach out to me and hug me and love me, but it's just too much to ask from a woman to do that. They're just not willing.

I used to have hope, when I was more ignorant about the world, a long time ago. As the years passed and I started getting older, my hope slowly eroded away. Now I realize it's already too late. I'm supposed to be way farther along in life - I have several mental illnesses that set me back a long way - but no one really cares anyway. Everyone is too wrapped up in their own romantic drama and their own lives to care about me. I just don't understand.

The few friends that I used to have mostly just told me that I need to be happy single, marriage is not as glamorous as I think, and compared my situation to people worse off than me. Didn't help much.

My life isn't going anywhere, and my life is consumed by work and depression. I just wish I had a solution.

1jsf6qb,I just want friends like before.,"When I was around 10 to 13, I had a lot going on in my internet life. I talked to many people and had a lot of friends, though I argued with most of them and was often bullied in group chats. I met most of those people through the **Gacha community**, which, at the time, was the only space where I truly felt like I belonged. Eventually, I grew out of that phase and so did everyone else. I don’t think anyone even likes Gacha anymore. After Gacha, I became sort of a **TikTok star**, and while I did make some friends there too, it wasn’t quite like the community I had in 2018–2019. Still, it was something.

2020 was a calmer year. I started talking to my father’s friend, someone I developed deep feelings for. She was my crush. I was honestly in love with her. But she left me around 2021, and that broke something inside me. After her, I still had a few friends from Instagram and TikTok, but it wasn’t the same anymore.

Then 2022 and 2023 happened.  
In 2022, I only had school friends, but that ended quickly when a classmate spread rumors about me about things I supposedly did. That basically killed every connection I had left. In 2023, I tried to stay in touch with a few friends on Instagram, but eventually, they all disappeared. I honestly don’t know how everything just started ending. It’s like I woke up one day and everyone was gone.

2024 and 2025 have been **extremely lonely** for me.  
I’ve tried finding people on Instagram, Facebook, even Bumble, but nothing. TikTok isn’t an option anymore because I’m barely active, and Reddit is just filled with *thirsty guys*. I’ve been feeling this deep, painful loneliness since 2023, and it’s been killing me slowly.

School has never been easy either. No one really wants to be my friend and maybe it’s because of how I look. Right now, in my class (10th grade), there are only 6 students: 3 boys and 2 other girls, plus me. We also have two students from 11th grade who join some classes. They’re friendly with each other, but no one talks to me. I don’t try anymore. I’m scared that if I try and something goes wrong, I’ll end up having to leave school like I had to back in 2021. I just want to survive quietly now. On top of all this, I lost my **maternal grandmother**, who was with me throughout my entire life. Her absence has left a hole I don’t know how to fill.

1js90p3,I feel more discouraged than ever,"So back in a September I met a girl on Reddit and we hit it off extremely well and became close friends talking every single day and on the phone and face timing etc.

Towards the end of December she posts on the friendship forum that she has feelings for her friend (and describes me). I was gonna bring it up but then she starts talking sexually to me, but then when I reciprocate she pulls away and says she isn’t ready for that. So I mention I saw her post and the feelings are mutual. But she says well now I’m not sure.

A while passes and she asks me to be her boyfriend and I’m really excited. She starts calling me hun and cyber sexts with me and I feel really happy. but then all of a sudden she completely cuts it all off. Won’t do anything sexual, stops calling me hun etc. I try to talk to her about it and she assures me nothing is wrong she just has anxiety.

But then in February she breaks up with me saying she has no feelings for me and only thought she did. We talked a while and she said maybe it’s because we hadn’t met in person so I said give me til the end of April and I will come out to see you (I live in WV she lives in Kansas) and she agrees.

Two days…. 2 days! After dumping me, I mention that I’ve met some new online friends who are female and she gets super jealous and stuff. Then she starts acting more flirty and sends me pics of her in her underwear and acts real sexual again.

I ask her to be with me and she says let’s meet first and then we can discuss it and I say okay. Eventually we settle on May 2 because that’s when the amusement park opens. Things seem okay. But then she starts pulling away again and when I bring it up she says she doesn’t have feelings for me.

1js44yy,"There is something exceptionally wrong with me for sure, and I don't know whether it's to do with looks or personality.","26M, and lately I've come to the realization that there's something fundamentally wrong i've been doing my entire youth for me to end up being FA , with only a one on one friends, who happen to be as socially inept as me.

Feels completely wrong blaming anything like looks , although I assume they play a factor too because when I've been out to a bar/club I've observed how girls flirted with the people I went to, but treated be as I was invisible. Perhaps  looks + weird body language. Idk anymore. Anyway, school, college uni, and even my old workplace I was always the odd one out, who kept to himself and was always excluded from any groups activities. All this because I felt rejected after every attempt to fit in. In fact at uni I made only one friend to whom I still speak to , but he lives far away from me.  Besides him I don't have any other true friends. The rest of my time at uni, I spent rotting in my room playing games,  drawing and completing my coursework. It's not like I didn't try to make friends and socialise, but from all the effort, I just ended up feeling even more depressed and isolated, all because no one returned the effort in getting to know me. In fact, people only focused on my negative traits for instance, ""Why are you so shy"", ""Why do you do this, this, this"" ? . All I was doing is trying to be nice, and engage in a talk, and listen, but still they treated me like something that came out of the sewers.

My hygiene is good, posture too, I am friendly, good listener, and i've been told that I'm a really chill person. Despite that i always give off weirdo vibes without intending to. On the contrary, I am slightly socially awkward, introverted, but still trying my best to engage.

I know I should be putting myself out there more, go to social events and stuff, but from all the social rejection, isolation, I feel so mentally exhausted and depressed that I don't even have the energy to do anything that involves talking to others.

1jrpxg0,Too much could go wrong with dating for me to ever find love.,"When I think of how many factors that go into play with dating being successful in actuality it seems like I am against all the odds. I wouldn't be compatible with anyone due to my sexual orientation most likely.  I'm introverted, autistic and have an avoidant attachment style.There's other things to consider like financial competence, politics, religion, whether to have kids or not have kids, and goals to consider. There so many big things in dating that I dont think anyone is ever going to check off all of my boxes. Too many things could go wrong and when I talk to anyone I just think they are leading me on or playing me anyways. I'm ugly so the difference holds a major contrast to the treatment I get everyday. I try dating apps but can't find anyone I like. There's just so many obstacles that would lead to divorce and I'm afraid of that also along with having an avoidant attachment style. I'll think I'm lonely but then when I talk to guys I start to feel trapped and second guess what I wished for.I start to replay what they said in my head and then think ""Well since they said x y z they must just be a player."" There's too much to be skeptical of especially with all the hookup culture where no one wants anything serious. I think I've become disillusioned by love. It can't be that good and if it is it's too good to be true in some way shape or form by either being toxic, or love not being enough to withstand the practical things a relationship needs or the person is just lovebombing just to butter someone up for their own selfish motives.

A thunderstorm rolls in.  Might as well stay in.  You find protection from the elements and sit outside just listening to and watching the rain.  The distant lightning.  It's too far to hurt you.  In fact in this moment, nothing seems like it could ever hurt you, with her by your side.  You just listen in silence.  It's an easy silence.  A comfortable silence.  It's not a silence that's begging to be broken, one that is caused by and continued by lack of knowing what to say.  It's a peaceful silence.  Your skin is chilled underneath your hoody, but not so much to drive you inside.  An hour passes.  Occasionally the silence is penetrated by fun conversation.  Maybe a chat about the beauty of nature.  You don't know the ugliness of it.  I mean you do, in an abstract sense.  Lions viciously ripping out babies from wombs, bedbugs forcibly inseminating females, all kinds of natural oddities.  But you don't know the *real* ugliness of nature.  The ugliness that condemns people, for whatever the reason, physical or psychological, to loneliness for the entirety of their life.  You don't know first-hand the brutality of human nature, it's selfishness.  Not with her next to you.  With her, whatever troubles the world has had in perpetuity either don't matter in the grand scheme of things, or will be sorted out in time.

1jpr2bp,Girl i was interested in ended up dating a friend i presented to her once,"Long story short: met a cute girl at work, she's pretty chill and we share some interests, i take up a lot of confidence and ask her to go out and spend an afternoon at the park, we get along well spending time with her feels light and amazing the afternoon was wonderful i never felt at ease like that with someone before, she's up for another hang out. Plan to go out a few more times with her over the course of a month or two so we know each other well and i can make a relationship blossom, going out with her felt soooo good i could spend days talking with her about our passions and views on the world.

I Invited her to a movie i planned to see with another friend of mine, it goes well and she plays into the group dynamic. And then it all goes bad, weeks passes by and i see from my friend's story both of them outside, when i confront him as to why he didn't invite me as well he gives me fake excuses and turns out they did go together a few times without me.

I talked with her at lunch break today and she just said that they were dating and she thanked me for introducing him to me. She said that she liked him a lot and that she liked me too but that it would be awkward to either go out with me while she's dating my bestfriend and that it'd be weird if i was in the middle of their group while hanging out. She said sorry for leaving me out like that and said that we could still speak over the phone or talk at work, she said that i was a ""rare guy to meet with rare qualities and a unique presence"" she said that she understood how well my friend and i are matching our energies (him being a very impulsive and energetic boy while im a calmer but always open to anything man) but she still dates my friend and not me. I know it's not healthy to stay in contact with someone you feel strong emotions with but can't reach, i don't know what to do now, i'll just step back and retreat in silence.

I don't know what to feel anymore now, it's not the first time it goes well with someone before it suddenly falls down. I don't know why im never a priority even if im a rare man with rare qualities. It always happens to others, i've yet to experience this pleasure too. I have to fight everyday just to get what others people have by just living normally. Companionship is a need, i want to have intimacy with a girl, i want to sleep in the same bed as her i, i want to hug and kiss her, i want to protect her, give her gifts, do anything for this hypothetical lady to be happy.

I workes on myself for years to bypass awkward talks, i attended events, joined clubs, talked with people. I took skincare, worked out, learnt how to style my clothes, learnt to dress myself, i have hobbies, i have an academic background, what do i lack i followed everything right, i always was virtuous and an honest man.

I wish to disappear into fine dust, if i have to live a life of silence i'd rather be a loud memory.

I am surrounded by people in love, by people having sex, by people who are attractive, smart, successful, and so on.

Like I am committing a crime by just being In their presence. I might as well be when I think about it though. It wasn’t their fault they had to see me and be subject to my ugliness and awkwardness. I did that to them. 

Even after all these years trying to come to terms with being FA, I still cannot stop having bouts of hope. No matter how many times I am made fun of, left out, or reminded how unlovable I am. 

Biology is evil. It’s forcing me to care. Maybe if I was a caveman these feelings of hope would help me survive the next day.

1jpe1ny,I wish society was kinder to perpetually single people,"In pop culture, mainstream media & society in general, singles over 25 or 30 are viewed as more carefree & iimmature than their counterparts. While feminism did a good job reducing the stigma around women who remain single well into their 30s, A guy who hasn't had substantial dating experience is viewed with more suspicion & disdain, whereas a guy who hasn't been loved at all is perceived as the penultimate loser across many societies. Even men's movements ridicule such men. The common denominator of insults for a man across the board is ridiculing his perceived lack of experience in romance or dating.

Contrary to popular stereotypes of men who are inexperienced in dating or serious relationships, most of us are normal people who just weren't lucky in Romance. We aren't some dysfunctional sociopaths or political extremists.

I'm a 31 year old male, had two short flings before, but never had a long term relationships. My close friends know this, but I lie to everyone else about my relationship status, saying either I got off a long term relationship or I'm working on one. Heck, even some paperwork nowadays ask reasons if the box ""never married"" is ticked. I feel like if my secret ever gets out, I'd be ridiculed, considered borderline dysfunctional & even look apprehensive to some.

I don't expect society to tell that we're okay, I guess I won't hear that in my life time. All that I hope is that if people were less judgmental of older adults, especially men, who aren't married or have little to no dating experience. Society tells us that it isn't a race & everyone's experience is unique, but that same society would raise eyebrows if you don't have something going on for you at a certain age.

If you're not a Forever Alone person reading this, please be kinder to people like us. We are not stagnated, we are improving ourselves everyday, most of us are good people. Treat us just like any person else. Before we find love, we'd love to be seen as human first.

1jp8p9o,Interview I had with a popular YouTube creator exposed to me the complexity of making connections,"So I recently had a video call with a YouTube creator about a program he had mentioned and announced people to sign up for. He has the most subscribers on there for his niche at around 210K. I was a little nervous about how the video calls/discussion would go from the beginning and also during. After the video call, he was impressed by how I was able to speak which to me was hard to believe.

This was hard for me to believe because like many of us on here in my decades of living in this doggone Earth, I still don’t have luck with women like I’ve been promised I would have. I can get dates and meet people however rarely any of the dates I’ve gone on they have an interest in wanting to see or talk to me again, and none of it has led to a relationship from me as I end up getting ghosted or turned it down at some point. Also, I hardly have any friends and all those friends really was the result of luck rather than me being an outgoing person, knowing how to talk to people or just being friendly, and having the good traits I’ve been always taught to have. 

This moment was a sure fire reminder that I feel like nearly anyone in general do not like me enough to have a connection or a relationship with me. I don’t feel like I’m a bad conversationalist and other people have told me that I converse in a good way or better than I thought. I also try to be friendly, considerate as much as I can, and make people laugh, and if I’ve tried demonstrating those traits to dozens of women over the past decade and not ONE had enough interest, I really don’t know what to do besides hope that I have some kind of luck.

Years of self sabotage and cutting myself off from people caused by constant abuse and bullying left me socially handicapped. I've got almost nobody left, I feel empty all the time, the only moments when I feel happy and can forget about what I did to myself are when I'm out with my cameras, a viewfinder is my safe space, but in the long term it's only just like putting a band-aid over a stab wound.

1jon5ts,I’m so tired.,"Let me know if I’m not in the right sub (and/or where I should go). 

40F and have had crickets on dating apps for 2 years. Last ex cleaned me out financially and I’m about a sneeze away from being homeless now because of that. 

I was told by my parents for YEARS that I didn’t need friends, I didn’t need a spouse, and I didn’t need kids. I’m fine without the kids part (would rather have pets), but I’m right where they wanted me my whole life. Completely alone. I work and come home. I work all the time too, make no money, and have little time for other activities. Any “friends” live too far away or make me initiate everything. I stopped initiating during covid because I was so tired of it. I still am. The ex who drained my savings was also abusive and manipulative, so that didn’t help the situation either, as he attempted to isolate me. 

Fact of the matter is, all 3 of my LTRs were because the guy was lonely or bored. Not because they actually cared about me. I got dumped by 2 of them (and they found their spouses soon after) and had to dump the manipulative one myself because I couldn’t take it anymore. I’m not physically attractive and never have been, and the last three guys I talked to on dating apps didn’t really go anywhere. 

I wish I could figure out what I’m doing wrong. I just seem to be the person no one likes or else used to get ahead. I’m just tired.

Just yesterday, in our therapy group, I opened up again about my hopelessness, feeling empty and depressed without love in my life and having never experienced it, when a guy says to me ""trust me it's not that all that...I mean yeah sex is great and all that but trust me it isn't all that..."" And this guy has been with his girl since he was 16, he's now 27. 

I am absolutely sick of it and I'm really considering slapping the next person that says this to me. 

I'll give an analogy. Imagine a group of hungry people starving to death, sitting outside a restaurant, being prevented by police from going in. Eventually they let one guy in, so he enters and eats and eats and eats till he's almost sick, and literally cannot get another morsel into his mouth, and feels sick just looking at the food. He then comes out and tells everyone else, I dunno what you guys are obsessing over, honestly it's not all that, I feel sick looking at the food now...

You get the analogy. 

These people are selfish ignoramuses. 

More than being insensitive, it's completely stupid. Another angle they seem to approach is that because the excitement and romance whittles down after a few months, it somehow renders the initial period of excitement and romance as worthless. That is completely stupidity. No pleasure in this life is perpetual, does that take away from the value of the experience? Why go out to eat at expensive places instead of always eating at home? Why go on holidays instead of just staying at home? Because the experience itself has value, even if it's not temporary.

1jn04hj,I feel disposable,"Whether I initiate first or the other person initiates something social, 9/10 times I get ghosted or cut off. It doesn’t matter whether it’s friendship or potential relationships, it almost always ends the same way. 

I haven’t made a new irl friend in several years. I’m autistic and I have a flat affect, which makes people think I’m cold and unfriendly. I’m polite, but most people my age automatically dislike me for my lack of facial expressions and flat voice. Old people tend to like me much more. 

When I have forced myself to mask and show emotions, people thought I was being insincere. The IRL friends I made before all gradually drifted from me and now I’m in touch with none of them more than once a year.

Instead, all I have are the handful of people I met on Discord that didn’t ghost me within a few days or months. We text multiple times a week and I like them, but the closest ones live three hours away and purely interacting online doesn’t really satisfy my need to socialize. Sometimes I join “friend making” servers to meet more people, but all of those people ghost super quickly (even the ones that add me first). I’d think it has something to do with me, but I’ve had multiple online friends say I was a nice person and a good texter.

Dating hasn’t been any better. Anyone who has shown interest in me changed their mind because I was either too oblivious until it was too late or I made a social mistake I didn’t notice that made them abruptly change their mind. I joined a few dating apps, but I’m in a somewhat rural area and since I’m nonbinary I went through all of the profiles on both apps available to me in less than a week. I got one like that I wasn’t into and then one match that I ended up having zero chemistry with. I am now 23 and I haven’t even had my first kiss.

I always see people on Reddit suggest the Meetup app for meeting people, but both in the big city I used to live in and the somewhat rural area I live in now the app is basically dead and the few events on there barely have any attendees (and they’re all 30+ years older than me).

The other “solution” I always see made online is to go to third places to potentially meet people, which I already do. Every day for the past year I’ve gone to a coffee shop and then the library to hang out for a while. No one ever strikes up a conversation with me and just looking at people my own age and walking in their general direction makes them say “piss off.” Even out here in the middle of nowhere Oregon, the Seattle Freeze is still in effect.

To everyone in my life outside my family I’m either just a person from school that they have nothing in common with anymore, or “Neb,” the internet stranger that’s sometimes fun to message.

1jmtspn,Drowning in the mud while others fly free,"Never had a girlfriend. Never had sex. Never kissed. Never even had a female friend. And it’s not just the absence of these things that gets to me, it’s how far behind I feel compared to everyone else. Like I’m some defective version of a human being.

I watch people my age live their lives like it’s the easiest thing in the world. They date, break up, move on, find someone new. Over and over. Meanwhile, I can’t even connect with one person. Not even one. And that fact alone makes me feel like I don’t even deserve to be here.

Imagine, in a few years, I somehow meet someone. Maybe they like me. Maybe they want to be with me. But then I realize they’ve had ten relationships before me. Ten. And I’m at zero. How could I ever compare? They're so far beyond me in life experience, they're a wise put together adult that has lived life while I'm just a naive immature child that stumbles around pathetically. They've had so much experience that they know exactly what they want, while I don't even know how it feels to hold hands. Would I even matter to them? Or would I just be another number? A temporary stop on their way to the next person? To them, relationships are just part of life, something that comes and goes. To me, it’s an impossible dream, something I’ve never even touched.

It makes me feel so small. Like an insect. Like an ant trying to compare itself to a god. They’ve spent years flying through the skies, living, experiencing, feeling. And me? I’m still crawling in the mud, unable to even take off. They’ve crossed oceans, seen the world. I don’t even know what the next puddle looks like.

I’m going to change some things in my life. I’ll get a hair transplant. I’ll try to fix what I can. But if by the end of 2027, my life is still the same, if I’m still stuck here, alone, watching the rest of the world fly while I sink deeper, feeling more inferior and disconnected by the day, I’ll stop fighting it. I’ll embrace it. I’ll go all in. I’ll dive as deep into the mud as I can, because maybe that’s where I belong. I’ll be 100% free. And if that kills me, so be it. At least I’ll have lived *something*. Even if it’s just for a moment.

And one day I will fade,  
And my soul will cascade through the waves and the wind and the sea.

I’ve been single for 14 years. My last ( and only) relationship was not a good one. He  was ashamed of being seen in public with me and would continuously say it. Always making me walk behind him or sent on the other side of the grocery story to avoid being associated with me. Saying I was good for bringing money in but too ugly and fat. 16 years of it… It left scars. Lots of them. I know now it was abuse. But when you meet someone at 17, have kids with them and they start treating you that way…you start to believe it’s normal. 

I ended up leaving. He said I would never find anyone else. 14 years later I do realize he was right.. I don’t know what real love is. I see it happening for others but not for me. I’m terrified of men. I’ve done the therapy, the meds, the self work…. Lost 100 pounds.. you name it.. 
I can handle being single but what I really miss right now is sleeping next to someone.. you know that safe and peaceful feeling of just being safely in your most vulnerable state? I envy those who have this on the daily… it’s such a small thing for them…

1jmf74c,"And so, I need to get some things of my chest.","*Every day I wake up, then I start to break up...*

  
Just for clarification - I'm writing this after 10 hour night shift in my country, and English is not my first language. 

  
Anyway, I feel empty inside for long time. I'm right now at the end of my studies... Went all without love. And you know what's worst? The thing that I was in love once. 

The story begins before the university. I knew a girl, who cheated on me. That's the important part - and the fact that her new boyfriend had to brag about ""stealing my girlfriend"" on my DMs. 

Went to the university in diffrent city, hoping to find someone. Was there not enough stories about loser who goes to new place and finds his love? Five years later - this is not one of this stories. Because of being desperate, I pushed people away from me. I was acting pathetic and honestly? I would stay away from myself. However, I just want to put emphasis on the fact, that I'm NOT the same guy as five years ago. I'm not acting all ""I'm so sad, so miserable"" (and yes, I know the fact that this post goes against this). 

I think the worst part is that I know that it's not them, not ""being misunderstood"". The blame is on me, the burden is mine to bear - that it was me, who pushed away any chances. And who lost. 

But well, I didn't give up. Had to survive, being a coward. Yes, a coward, because It's not hope, it's fear that kept me still. Fear of death, of making the last straw... Call it however you want. Mind that it was pandemic, and I was literally locked up. 

So I started looking for people. After all, that's the advice everyone will give you, right? Dating apps are biased (and with my face being the 100% working anticonecption, I had no hope. i tried them, so it's not just ""it would end that way!""), so the best is to have a hobby and go there, to find someone who will love you, and the pasion will join you two!

Yeah, sure. Here's a list:

\- I playe TTRPGs. Joined a server four years ago, with our community recruited in a way ""I know a guy who wants to play"". Guess who's still alone. 

\- I play video games. I'm on a server from one game I really like. Guess what. 

\- I joined a students organisation focused on integration - basiclly we meet for once for roughly two weeks and drink alcohol, sing shanties... Not a parties, mind you. More like ""a group of colleagues goes out"" is best description. 

\- I like to read books. So started a small book club. 

And I want to tell you one important thing, why fate decided that I'm gonna stay forever alone. 

When there's a girl in one of the higher groups... She has someone. A boyfriend, a fiance, a husband. Of course, not every girl. 

Of course it's not every case. There are girls who are single. They are lesbian.

That's the 100% girls who I meet in these spaces. And ending my studies, I feel like my options are ending. Yes, there is work... 

But being a night creature I am, I will be looking for Night Shift. That usually are single employee.

And now, what's the most burdening thing? I'm still a virgin. Yes, I know, sex is not that awesome, it will be bad, because every first time is bad, it's not the most definig thing in your life...

They're just telling a hungry man that food is not important and it will taste bad. A metaphor for me, but can you really tell in our culture ""you should not want to have sex once""? And yes, I know about sex workers. It's just... It doesn't feel the same in my mind. I put the diffrence between sex with someone who loves you and paying someone for sex.  

And I'm afraid. Because I don't want to become a wizard. 

Among my friends I am know as the ""clown"", ""the jester"", ""the meme professor"". And yes, I tell jokes about being a wizard, about the right hand. And yes, they laugh with me. 

But then comes a nights like this one - where I feel like a nobody. Like I could disappear and they wouldn't even notice. The family and pressure do not help, but this is not this kind of sub. It's just that I feel like the funny kid when I come back to my home, or sit in work when nothing happens. And start thinking, how my bed will stay cold. How I can't even hug anybody with romantic feelings.  How I am alone in all of this. How even if there is a girl, I lose headstart. Because I have some kind of honor - I'm not going after taken girls. 

And worst? How I tasted this. How I know what it feels to be loved. How it feels to be important to someone and knowing someone is important to you. How it feels to kiss. 

I miss this feelings. 

A question that will forever remains - is it better to stay in the unknown, never knowing how it is being loved? Or is it better to taste this, and then never more?

To end this in a bit positive note, I will quote a comment I once read on youtube under doomer mix. Yes, I listened to them. Yes, I was going on nightwalks. Yes, I was... And I still am a doomer. And yes, the comment is cheesy and stupid... But I like it.

1jlmomu,False Hopes,"I will try to cut it as short as possible. 

1. A couple years ago, a woman asked me in a counseling hour to study together. This is at university. I agreed. Well, needless to say, despite my best efforts to think too much into it and despite her telling me that she isn't currently looking for a boyfriend I still got my hopes up. It is ridiculous. Anyways, we studied together for a while, which was honestly nice and at some point we kinda faded away lol. 

2. This year I met a woman at work place. Kind of happened ""accidentally"". Felt like we are getting along well. Again, despite me telling myself years ago to not get my hopes up I still did. Today I finally reached to the conclusion that there is truly nothing going on between us.

In conclusion. It is crazy to me how a nice gesture from a woman I find attractive can immediately shoot my hopes up, no matter how much I tell myself that I am not husband material. No matter how often I tell myself that she is just being friendly or nice. 

Why does this happen? 

On the other hand, I see that hope is truly an amazing and strong thing. It is truly strong. If I could only focus my hope in the right areas of my life. Maybe I would have been already successful or smth. 

Am still stuck in the *wanting to marry* phase no matter what I do. At least I did realize that I use p0rn to rather drown these feelings instead of actually dealing with them. Time heals. I just have to *suffer* through these emotions. It'll get better. Still annoying to deal with these emotions. You just crave a relationship so effin much. It is crazy. Eghhhh.

1jlfroe,"""Do not date your coworkerd"" is such a difficult rule for people with no social life outside work.","Imagine you don't have a social circle big enough to be meeting women.

Imagine you finished your university, you are in your late 20's, no previous relationships.

The only women you meet are your coworkers. It's such a difficult situation because maybe you befriend some of this women, you get to know them and they maybe have a nice opinion about you but you cannot date them.

So since you can't, but you don't have women in your life outside work you rely on tinder or another dating app which is still bad.

It's a fucking nightmare. Especially in the country where i am from where people date people who they met in school or uni, not classmates but people they met in Uni maybe during parties etc.

I feel i am getting punished for not having had a girlfriend in Uni.

As an adult it's difficult to meet women. I hate that but that's how it is.

In the past the main reason i never got laid is that i was shy of being 20, at Uni and a virgin.

Now look where this fear got me. Late 20's and still a virgin is worse.

Now i almost fall in love with every women that are good looking at work.

I go out with colleagues maybe, have fun with this female coworkers but they don't see me as a potential partner also because they have more opportunities as me so they are not so desperate that they are willing to date a coworker.

So everytime i might have drinks with coworkers i come at home, alone, sad that nothing will ever happen.

1jkhgca,I’ve never been loved,"TRIGGER WARNING FOR ASSAULT AND S*CIDE THEMES, ALONG WITH SELF HARM


I genuinely can't do this anymore. Realising i've never been loved in my life hurts a lot. My parents never loved me and pretty much beat me my whole life. The only good moments i remember were from before 5. I just kind of miss being a kid no one hated, loved unconditionally and hugged. 

Once I started elementary school, teachers didn't like me and did the most to move me away from my friends. At 7, I got an actual knife pulled on me. I got sex*ally assaulted. I forgive who assaulted me because they didn't physically hurt me. But at the same time, what the f*ck. In that same year, I also almost drowned 2 times and no one did anything. Not even asking me if i was fine. 

I started attempting s*cide from 8 years old various times. Once again, no one cared. My friends never ever expressed they love me, they insulted me and after like 7 years of friendship they ghosted me. At 11, I started cutting and had depression, no one cared. I told the psychologist and she gave me the fluoride stare. Which is why i never understood how people didn't wanna confess they wanted to d*e at the psychologist, I literally posted everyday i was about to kms on the whatsapp or instagram story and no one cared. Even when i tried hanging myself and had scars no one cared. 

I once self harmed super badly because of a mental breakdown and all my parents said was ""don't do that or people will think we beat you"". Not even are you ok. I had psychosis, no one cared.

Everyone I've ever wanted has rejected me or ghosted me. And i'm not even ugly, and i obviously don't tell my mental problems to people, when you're this f*cking insane and unloved you learn early how to be normal. 

I've never really had anyone i could talk to and even if i spoke to them all they said was oof. I started antidepressants at 19 secretly bc my mom is against medicine and they didn't even work no matter how we increased the doses i still had meltdowns. I have the emotional capacity of a 3 year old at 20. I am constantly screaming, trying to not hurt myself or break things bc frankly i cant do this anymore. 

On reddit, even when i express who my fav characters are on bitch ass cartoons subreddits i get death threats. I express my fav songs on singer subreddits: death threats. I say all my opinions get downvoted and i get called stupid and insulted to hell for saying the truth. 

I am a virgin, never had a bf, never ha d afriend group, job or anything. Trying to not k*** myself is really hard, knowing i'm unloved and i never will be loved. Great stuff.

1jjro2e,I think going to single sex ruined me socially,"So at the age of 10 I moved countries and since then have only gone to single sex. So… no real chance to interact with women my age. At uni I was to socially awkward/anxious given how it was such a big change to school and so I didn’t really make any friends let alone friends of the opposite gender. 

The few times I tried to make friends nothing really stuck.

Now I’m in my mid 20’s and it’s all dawned on me that I’ve never really experienced anything whereas literally everyone else my age including my friends from school someway somehow have been able to let alone literal 15/16 year olds and it really pisses me off.

Even if by some miracle it does happen I’ll never be someone’s first and my lack of experience means I’ll likely fuck up several things. I hate how it feels like I’ve missed out on so much and now there’s no way to change it and I’m becoming bitter and resentful.

Here I am trying/struggling to get by with work/responsibilities whilst care free teens are having sex/fun and all these other things I never got to do and there’s no guarantee I ever will. I genuinely have no idea how to get over this.

I have a younger sibling who had sex pretty much as soon as they turned 16 (which was my dream/ what I thought was ideal) and has several friends of the opposite gender and I hate/resent how easily it’s all happened for them and not me. And whilst they’ll never say it I bet they’ve quite pleased/ think it’s quite cool that it’s all happened for them and not me yet.

Anytime sex is mentioned in something I watch/read I instantly feel triggered. It feels like a constant reminder that everyone I know my age if not younger has had sex/ experienced a popular relationship or at the very least friends with people of the opposite gender and even that is foreign to me.

1jw9dyf,Feeling hopeless and depressed.,"I'm 29M, never had a girlfriend, never had sex, never even been on a date. Even when I try online dating, I never get matches. I retried Tinder last year, and to this day have not gotten a single match. If that isn't a sign that I'm completely unappealing to woman, I don't know what is.

I have some pretty bad mental issues that prevent me from behaving normally. In all social situations I'm overly quiet and only speak when spoken too. If people ask questions, I give vague answers. I pretty much never show emotion. I'm too scared to open up even slightly. And that isn't even half of my mental problems.

It hurts seeing every other person around me in a relationship. It hurts knowing I passed my high school/college days without a single bit of romantic or sexual experience. It hurts that no woman has ever found me attractive. And it hurts that I don't have the drive to improve myself. People say to be confident, but there's nothing about myself that warrants confidence. I know people say that you have to love yourself before loving someone else, but it feels like you shouldn't love yourself if nobody else can.

1jshj9d,"Even if you feel deeply lonely, don’t settle for the only relationship you can get—especially if there are red flags from the start.","I’m a 34-year-old man, and in my life, I’ve only had one relationship. Strangely, I felt lonelier in that relationship than I ever did alone. Before we got together, we were friends—and during that time, I didn’t feel lonely. But the closer we became, the more we changed, and the more isolated I felt. That relationship came with many negative emotions.

In the early stages, I blamed myself for everything—even when she lashed out at me. I told myself I had no experience with relationships, that I didn’t understand how they worked, and that it was all my fault. I thought, “If I just change, things will get better.” Instead of walking away, I dug in deeper—far too deep. I felt desperately lonely, and this seemed like my only chance at a relationship. Despite all the red flags and clear signs that it wasn’t going to work, I kept pushing through because I didn’t want to be alone.

I remember feeling intense jealousy in the evenings, walking by myself and seeing couples out together—laughing, chatting, just being. For them, it all seemed so natural. Relationships looked easy, like second nature. But not for me.

One of the hardest things to accept is that I’m massively unattractive. My recent Tinder experience says it all: 12,000 right swipes, 21 matches. Out of those 21, at least half didn’t even reply. I could hardly believe I had swiped that many times—but that's what the stats showed.

On top of that, I struggle with social anxiety. My communication skills often feel like those of an alien who just landed on Earth—clueless about how to talk to people or fit in.

This post isn’t just to vent or cry. I’m always working to improve myself. In fact, after the breakup, my mental health began to improve. I’ve been making an effort to talk to more people and have joined some local groups. I still often feel lonely and misunderstood in those spaces—not many people can relate to what it’s like to struggle this much with basic communication—but I’m trying. As I get older, I’m learning to appreciate life more. I know I have to keep trying, and maybe, one day, I’ll meet people I can truly connect with.

So, if you’re lonely and find yourself in a relationship just because it’s an opportunity—please think carefully. Watch for red flags early. Don’t go as far as having a child with someone when the foundation of the relationship is already built on strange, often frightening arguments.

It’s tough, though. Honestly, if someone had tried to warn me back then, I probably would’ve just gotten defensive—stubborn like a ram—and kept going anyway. Still, that relationship taught me a lot about recognizing warning signs and understanding what relationships should and shouldn’t be.

Of course, I’d love to find a soulmate—someone who understands what it’s like to struggle with communication, maybe even someone going through something similar. Being a foreigner in the UK makes it even harder to feel like I belong. Though that’s not the main issue—the core of it is my difficulty connecting with people.

I’m not going to lie—part of the reason I’m writing this is the hope that maybe, just maybe, there’s a lost soul out there like me. Someone who struggles with the same kind of social anxiety, who might read this and feel seen. And maybe, in some dream-like way, I’d receive a message that says:  
  
""Let's go, our paths align. I can relate. I am an alien too. We'll figure it out together.""

Of course, I know I’m exaggerating a little with the words…  
But still—this is my dream.

1js9o58,Torn between the desire for love and the hypocrisy of seeking it,"I’ve been single for over 12 years. Not because I’ve been hurt or disappointed — but simply because I had other priorities. After my first relationship at 18 (which lasted two years and felt more like a societal checkbox than anything deeply emotional), I focused on my studies, student jobs, and later, my career. I told myself that love — whatever that meant — would come “later.”

And for more than a decade, nothing happened. I didn’t look, I didn’t feel like I was missing out, I was content. That changed in 2024 when I met someone through work. We weren’t together — nothing happened between us — but I genuinely felt something for the first time in my adult life. I felt love. I felt like a better version of myself around her. I imagined a future. And when I realized that this wouldn’t go anywhere, I found myself… torn.

On one hand, I now want to share my life with someone, because I’ve had a glimpse of what that can feel like. On the other hand, I find everything around the idea of looking for love incredibly hypocritical and alienating. Let me explain.

1) The dating culture and apps feel fundamentally inauthentic.

Apps like Tinder reduce people to commodities — swiping left and right based on looks, like flipping through a catalogue. They’re built on animal impulses: you feel desire, you match, you message — and maybe, you hope, something meaningful will emerge. But how can something deep grow out of something that started on such a shallow foundation?

2) Even “natural” dating advice feels fake to me.

People often say: “Just go out, meet people, smile, approach someone who seems interesting…” But again, it’s all built on the same physical impulse: “Approach her because she’s attractive.” It feels like we’re pretending to build something emotional on a foundation that is purely visual and instinctual. That kind of play-acting — pretending we’re not all trying to game each other into relationships — just doesn’t sit right with me.

3) The only way I’ve ever felt something real was over time.

What happened in 2024 wasn’t about a first date, a swipe, or a flirty approach. It was about months of conversations, shared work, stress, laughter, mutual respect. I saw that person in good days and bad ones. And over time, my feelings grew — not because I was looking for love, but because I got to know her. That’s the only context where love has ever felt real to me.

And yet, I know this: if I don’t actively do something different, nothing will change. I’ll go another 12 years alone. I’m aware of that. But still, I can’t bring myself to go through the motions of dating the way most people do — because deep down, it feels dishonest. I’m not saying others are wrong for doing it — it just feels wrong for me.

So yeah… I don’t know what I’m looking for by posting this. Maybe just to articulate the conflict inside me. I want to share my life with someone — not because I feel lonely, but because I now know how much better life can feel with the right person. But I don’t want to chase ghosts or force something that isn’t real.

1jriq2i,"Depressed about dating, where to go from here","(28M) I’ve struggled with understanding dating since I was 8. I feel absolutely worthless as a single guy who’s only had a short fling seven years ago. I was awkward and fat in high school; losing 90 lbs from running didn’t do anything for me, I guess bc everyone here partners up by age 21. All I see are people online and in-person are dating or married. I live in a small town of 7000 and can’t move until I save enough for it (moving to NYC). I work out and am pretty lean. I’ve gotten some matches on dating apps and have been called cute and handsome, but I still feel so worthless because I don’t have a relationship. Nothing can replace that. This has become an obsession and has motivated me to eat a lot less to burn off what fat still remains. It’s making me lose sleep and affecting my concentration at work. I just want to feel like I matter to someone on a deep level. I’m so sick of being lonely. This angst is causing heart palpitations. I post about things like this and barely anyone cares. I’m not some gross slob who can’t run a 1/4 mile, I’ve run up to 15 miles. I’m 5’7, which is a little short, but I can also grow a good beard and am funny at times. I’m 150 lbs for reference.

Understanding dating is SO much harder than anything I’ve ever tried to do (half marathons, driving for 18 hrs straight, college). It’s like a science that only a preselected elite are allowed to be able to understand. You have to not be fat (got it), but you also need to possess a specific type of personality, l be above 6’0, have five close friends, and be wealthy. It’s so unfair because I’ve done everything I’ve been able to think of to make myself more attractive that I have to power to do right now and am still pushing further with that by dieting rigorously and still working out. Dating apps barely seem to work well for me (probably because of my location in a small town), but it still pains me so much. Will it get easier when I move to NYC assuming I put myself out there, successfully become fully lean, and get a good job there? Can dating work for me if I do everything on my end to make myself more appealing?

However, do I truly ""count"" if I've had an ex-girlfriend before, even though she was abusive? 

When we were together, she laughed at the way I looked, tried to separate me from my female friends by accusing me of sexual harassment, and cheated on me with a pedophile when I was in the hospital from a life-threatening incident, leaving me scared of women to this day leading me to cut those same female friends off in case they might've believed her behind my back.

But does the fact that I even got to the point of ""dating"" her disqualify me or am I still FA given that she didn't actually like me or how I looked?

In addition, I've also had 1 (one) other opportunity. A girl at my college was interested in me, but later revealed that I was just an attempted replacement for a guy she liked who didn't like her, once again meaning that it didn't matter who I was, she just needed literally anybody to fill the space.

You have no problem interacting with other people, familiar or not. You say good morning. You say excuse me when trying to move by. You say thank you after recieving help or service. 

You don't speak much. Your try to keep your side of a conversation short and to the point. You prefer it that way so that you don't misinterpret what the other person is saying or miss a critical piece of infomation. Despite the care taken, you always feel like you've said the wrong thing. You analyze conversations aftward, to discern where you went wrong, and what you could do better in the future.

You are aware of your surroundings. You seem to be on a different wavelength than other people. Nobody takes interest in your interests. Nobody seems to like what you like, or the way you like it. Not music, movies, books, or games. You feel alienated from other people. When others comment on your uniqueness, you don't see it as a compliment. You wonder if life would better if you were a faceless sheep in the herd.

You are kind. At some point in your childhood, maybe at home, maybe in elementary school, maybe in church, someone told you to always be kind and respect others.You took that to heart without knowing it. You are generous. Your generosity hurts you. Your first instint when asked for something is give it. Even if you don't have that something to give. Even when it leads to you suffering. You don't mean to be this way. There's something deep inside of you, that compels you to help without thinking. It makes you sad, because you never ask anything of anybody. Nobody cares.

You are lonely. Specifically for love most of all. You desire to be in love and to be love by a woman. More than being taught to be kind and respectful to others, you were taught to be kind and respectful to women above all. It's a core part of you. You don't know when it started. You never paid much attention to it as a child, but now you're a adult, it's a pillar of your life. Yet, you've never had a girlfriend or lover. 

You are friendly. You are courteous. You respect women's spaces. You can hold conversations with women, but there's still a gap you cannot close. No woman desires you. You're missing something. Weren't you given the tools to begin a relationship. You watch other men and couples to learn what you're doing wrong. What you learn is that other men are doing the exact opposite of what you were told. They are not kind, they berate women. They are not calm, they threaten women. They are not respectful, they lay their hands on women without consent. You are perplexed, but what is more perplexing is that women seem to not care. 

You are not stupid. The obvious answer is right in front of you. You must be more like those other men, if you want to find love. You refuse. You will never be like those other men. You would rather die than be like those other men. You don't mean to be this way. There's something deep inside you that compels you. Maybe you're crazy. Maybe you're a narcissis. Maybe you're a fool. Maybe everything you were taught about life and love was a lie. Maybe you deserve to be alone.

1jnstr9,I've accepted being a loser,"How to be a happy loser: my philosophy.

Due to serious personal and mental issues, people will always hate me and I will almost certainly be alone forever. I’m not going into details, but to anyone saying I should get therapy or that I can still enjoy this world: believe me, this is the best way I can live.

I used to be suicidal, but I learned that instead of killing the body, it is better to kill your emotional connection to the world. I have maladaptive daydreaming and I day-dream a lot. In fact, I can’t imagine life without it (haha). It is how I have always dealt with boredom and isolation. It’s escapism, but I really don’t see that as a bad or crazy thing. Some people do drugs, others watch or play things on screens, and some people are religious or spiritual. I am not saying they are wrong, but they are all examples of people focusing on something other than this world. Although I do it in a way that is personalized, controllable, and requires almost no sacrifice.  If life sucks, why not focus on something better? If everything is meaningless, then it is meaningless to acknowledge that fact. So I decided, why be the bad kind of crazy when you can be the good kind?

Different religions offer ways to cope with suffering. Some say your suffering is what you deserve as punishment, some say it is part of a divine plan, and others say you will be rewarded for your endurance. I also learned from the Hindu Mahabharata that those who are dedicated to “Emancipation” see everything as the same: gold the same as rock, silver like dirt, etc. A Buddhist text I read said something similar: everything is nothing, good may be different from bad, but they are both ultimately nothing. Religion also teaches that nothing in this world lasts forever, so it is best not to get attached. You see, faith and belief can improve people on their own because they break down the barriers of the mind. When the mind has no barriers, your actions are limited only by your body. This has allowed people to do things they otherwise wouldn’t have been able to, such as increased charity, fasting, starving and emaciating your own body, and even giving up your life. 

During the pandemic, when my life was empty as ever, I really got into dreams. I have been recording my night-dreams for a very long time. They are a great source of inspiration for day-dreams and during this time, they became sort of like a second world or life, whereas my real life was like a simple game where I just press buttons. Good times. It really helped motivate me to take sleep seriously. But this also led to new ideas. What if I could create a better world within myself? What if I could pretend I was on drugs and get the effect I desired? What if I could become a culture of my own? The very existence of dreams and hallucinations prove that the mind can create brand new experiences; it just needs to be “unlocked”. Something else I noticed in my dreams is that I could have fake memories. For example, seeing straps in an airplane in a dream and fondly remembering how when I was a baby, they would put us here during the flight where we’d play with toys. I learned that memories can be altered or even fabricated, so that may be useful if I ever want to forget something.

I once heard about the concept of “tulpas”, which are basically imaginary friends for adults. I used to think that would take too much energy, but later on realized I had done something similar. When I was younger, I learned that talking to girls felt very therapeutic, so I gave myself an imaginary girlfriend. I met her during a night-dream and decided she would be the one. We listen to music, talk, watch videos, and go for walks together all the time. In fact, sometimes she is the one singing. She’s always there for me and I don’t know where I’d be without her. I also have imaginary friends. They are not like weird cartoon characters, just a bunch of normal guys and gals my age. They really help me to feel normal, as I talk to them about stuff and we go on adventures. That’s important, because I realized the cure to insecurity, neediness, self-centeredness, and wrong-thinking was to have “a life” and normal friends. After all, life is best spent with “your people” and it is best to discuss problems with people who actually care! You may ask “why don’t you befriend real people?”. Well, I find that hard since, in addition to my mental issues, I don’t relate to people well and rarely share interests with them. At the end of the day, I just don’t have much to say and am an introvert anyway. It’s alright though; I know some things can’t be forced. They have to happen naturally or not at all. You may also ask “why don’t you get a real girlfriend?”. Well, why would I do that when I already have someone closer than a soulmate? Also taking into account current trends and attitudes towards relationships, I don’t think it’s worth the money, time, and effort. There is the sex factor, but I doubt I’ll ever get it.

Now, what I have said goes against what society says. But normal people don’t know everything. Some people become homeless, imprisoned, or just outcasted, some people become disabled and spend their lives immobile, and other people just become old and all their friends die. My point is that the world leaves many people behind, whether they deserve it or not. Even if I could have a “normal” life, I would not want to lose my ability to stave off boredom and loneliness. After all, if something is not a human right, you have to be able to live without it. 
Besides, regardless of your views, I think we can all agree this world isn’t meant to be enjoyable, so it makes no sense to try to get all of your happiness from it. The whole theme of what I have said is detachment. A lot of the people who disagree are too attached, they love to feel things. But I have to ask why? The whole point of emotions is to make us seek out good things and avoid bad things. But when that is impossible, it leads to suffering as we want an outcome we can’t have. So sometimes it is better to feel nothing. This could also apply to physical pain, as there are cases where it is best to distract yourself from what you are feeling rather than listen to the sensation. Maybe there is a point where we no longer need to feel. After all, you can still win a video game and complete objectives without feeling what your character feels. You may say that feeling things is what allows us to relate to others, but what if no one cares? Others say that if we can’t feel pain, how can we feel the need to help people who are? That does not really apply to me because no one wants anything to do with me. If I support any cause or ideology, my association alone will undermine it as people will say “that worthless guy supports them? They must be bad”. And I can’t really help anyone financially right now either.

So yeah, that’s the way I live. I’m pretty sure I’m right about this but I’m open to further discussion.

Also, he is FA just like many of us, he definitely has been wanting to move to another country because he hasn’t had as much luck too with women.

I’ve kinda told him in many of those years that I wouldn’t consider doing so for various reasons. Lately, I feel like he is starting to become a little pushy about that to the point where when I told him that I tried nearly everything to have luck, he told told me not really because of the fact that I’m not willing to immigrate to another country just to have some hope according to him. 

I mean, he’s been a good friend to me the last several years, which is very rare for me to have especially people like us who may not have friends. However, how would you personally respond to this situation if your friend I told you to move to another country possibly just to possibly have better luck than here in America?

1jpg8tl,Can't stop thinking about someone I barely knew from years ago,"Just wanted to get this off my chest.

I randomly stumbled across a distant relative's social media profile I barely knew who I only spoke to once years ago. It triggered a memory I had of her, and now I cannot get her out of my head. I feel this intense desire to reach out to her, but I am worried this obsession is unhealthy and it would be better for me to forget about this.

She has a tragic backstory. When she was just a baby, she went through cancer and survived. Despite not really knowing her growing up, we had a sort of connection where we went to preschool together as young children (I have no memory of her back then). We are both the same age and related as second cousins with the same last name. My mom told me about her and that's the only reason I knew about her.

Then my high school graduation came. I did high school through a private teacher who took in kids who struggled in public school. I was a fairly high achiever for that class so I ended up going to college as part of a state program to do alongside high school when I was 16 and instead of showing up there, I was given course work to do on my own time. She ended up joining that same class for senior year and it wasn't until my graduation that we crossed paths.

She approached me directly before the grad ceremony, acknowledging my name like she already knew me and asked how I was doing and we talked for a bit, indicating her mom probably briefed her on who I was as well.

I did not expect this and was initially caught off guard, but I quickly put the pieces together since I was told she would be there and carried on talking with her like we already knew each other. I'm not gonna shy away from stating that she is a beautiful young woman who was kind and seemed genuinely interested in what I had to say in a way almost none of my other closer relatives ever did.

I am now 25, I have no friends, have never had a relationship, and I'm frequently lonely. I have had my share of parasocial attachments, but this one scares me. I am worried I hold these deepseated feelings for her and that is why I constantly think about her, and that's just messed up. I feel like there is something deeply wrong with me. I feel like I would be disappointed if she had a boyfriend (which is likely at this point), and how tf could that matter to me unless I had those underlying feelings caught up beneath this? Maybe that would get in the way of us connecting because she would have other priorities, but that's something that should make me happy for her.

I think it's probably best I just move on and forget about her, but god, it feels so great imagining me and her catching up on life again even if it's just another 5 minutes.",Ok_Frosting6547,0,2,Advice Wanted,cant stop thinking someone barely knew year ago wanted get chest randomly stumbled across distant relative social medium profile barely knew spoke year ago triggered memory get head feel intense desire reach worried obsession unhealthy would better forget tragic backstory baby went cancer survived despite really knowing growing sort connection went preschool together young child memory back age related second cousin last name mom told thats reason knew high school graduation came high school private teacher took kid struggled public school fairly high achiever class ended going college part state program alongside high school instead showing given course work time ended joining class senior year wasnt graduation crossed path approached directly grad ceremony acknowledging name like already knew asked talked bit indicating mom probably briefed well expect initially caught guard quickly put piece together since told would carried talking like already knew im gon na shy away stating beautiful young woman kind seemed genuinely interested say way almost none closer relative ever friend never relationship im frequently lonely share parasocial attachment one scare worried hold deepseated feeling constantly think thats messed feel like something deeply wrong feel like would disappointed boyfriend likely point tf could matter unless underlying feeling caught beneath maybe would get way u connecting would priority thats something make happy think probably best move forget god feel great imagining catching life even another minute,0.09016666666666664,0.4642083333333333
1jpared,I’m spiraling and don’t know what to do,"
(Sorry for the messy English, it's not my 1st language)

About 8-9 months ago, I (19M) walked in on my then GF in bed with another guy. Needless to say, this one event (and the ensuing messy breakup) did a number on my mental health and it took me a very long time to get back to where I was. I went on a healing journey, picked up some hobbies, stayed consistent at the gym, and I tried to expand my horizons a little bit. All to make me a better person and with the goal of becoming more desirable. Don't get me wrong, I'm proud of my progress, but I was perfectly happy with the person I was before the breakup (Gym 5x a week, fluent in 3 languages, decent personality, etc.), so my main motivator behind further self improvement was finding a life partner.

Now recently, I felt ready enough to start dating again. The apps were a complete disaster. Less than 10 matches total over 2 months (I tended to swipe right on 50% of profiles), with most either never responding or being bots/scammers. I did also go out and meet people, both through my hobbies (Rugby, book club, volunteering mainly), and at bars and clubs (usually went out with my friends on Fridays). I've always struggled to talk to women (really bad social anxiety and ADHD), so I never got anywhere at clubs and bars. I was able to give good impressions but I could never keep someone's attention before they got bored or moved on to the next guy. I had a bit more luck at the food bank I volunteer at and met this wonderful girl there.

We hit it off really quickly. Turns out we share a lot of the same interests (she was also a big reader and had been interested in rugby), and she even had the same tastes as I did with both TV and books. It all really seemed too good to be true, but when we get comfortable with each other I asked her out for coffee. Things went really well, and we committed to a 2nd date. The 2nd date also went well and we started dating regularly. We really clicked and started dating regularly. I made sure to be myself, which she seemed to enjoy, and I didn't bring up anything too sexual unless the conversation prompted it. I felt like I may have finally found that happiness I was chasing with my ex, so I made plans to ask her to be exclusive on our 6th date. We made plans, and I paid for a reservation at a pretty nice restaurant. I also set up a small surprise at an overlook nearby where I'd pop the question.

I never got that far.

On the day, I texted her in the morning to make sure we were still on, and we updated each other throughout the day. Originally the plan was for me to pick her up and drive us, but she told me something came up and she'd meet me there. I guess this was the first red flag. I got to the restaurant, and I waited. I tried texting and calling, but 0 response. I waited until the restaurant called and told me they couldn't hold our reservation anymore, so I cancelled it, went home, and just cried for a very long time. I've been rejected, ghosted, and even stood up since I had started dating again but it never felt like actual betrayal before.

This was all 3 days ago and I don't think I've ever felt this lonely. At this point I've lost my motivation and only get out of bed to attend classes and get my homework done. I feel like some kind of freak, undeserving of love. I push everyone away, I did it with my ex, and now I've done it with this girl and I don't even know what I did wrong. She seemed fine earlier in the day but just dissappears later. We've met and hung out so many times. I just feel disgusted by myself. I thought I could handle failure but at this point it feels like a pattern with me as the common denominator. I feel pathetic getting this hung up over someone I wasn't even in a relationship with, and all the repressed memories from my past breakup have come rushing back.

I've started to resent dating, but there's nothing I'd hate more than to become that one guy who sits in front of his computer all day and blames women for all his misfortunes. I want to be better. I work on myself constantly in order to be someone I can take pride in, I work out 5 times a week and I'm proud of my current state. But whats the point of living this life if I've got no one to share it with? All my close friends rave about how awesome their partners are, and how great they feel as a couple, while all I could do was grin and bear it with the hopes that I would also find someone I could share that joy with, but not anymore. I'm so close to giving up and I just can't see the point of going thru all this effort when it results in nothing.

Sorry for the vent, but I'm just so frustrated, it seems that no matter what you do, something happens.
