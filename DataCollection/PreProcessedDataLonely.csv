while i‚Äôm learning to accept that, as someone who is also childless and not on the career path that i have a master‚Äôs degree for, i feel really behind right now and im sad i have no community to help get me through it. i feel sad that i don‚Äôt have a group to have board game night with or go to the beach or craft or anything. 

i don‚Äôt have people that just naturally love the things i do and want to connect with me over them. at this point, i think people like me because im an enthusiastic and empathic listen and i like to mirror people & that‚Äôs all i‚Äôve ever gotten out of my relationships.

1jvucgg,"My friend takes forever to message back, now I feel abandoned.","So, I've had this friend for about 2 years now and always have a great time talking to them. Recently, she moved to the other side of the city, about an hour drive, and it's made seeing her difficult as we don't  share days off work. 

We still message every day and organise to hang out whenever we take time off work or if she's down to visit her grandparents, I'll sometimes get invited to come over and play games with them.

When she lived close by we messeged constantly and got to see each other all the time, but since the move, she's gotten a boyfriend and barely manages to message me at all, with a full day being the longest I've gone without a reply. I know it could be longer, but it just feels like ages. To give an example of how it goes  I'll message at 7am, she'll message back at 9pm that same day, then I'll respond a few minutes after and won't hear from her again until, like, 5pm the next day.

I've spoken to her about how long it takes to reply and that It feels like I'm being forgotten and that she never has time to message back, despite being active on social media. She responded, saying that she knows she's gotten pretty bad at responding and is sorry that it keeps happening and does value our friendship, while also saying she'll work on it and try to respond more often. 

This lated for about a week, then she goes right back to messaging me days later. Now, I totally understand that she can be busy at work or might have something going on at home or is going through something she doesn't want to talk about. Those are totally valid reasons for taking a long time to respond. I just wanna know, what should I do?
I've thought about not messaging back for a full day to see if she'll notice or telling her again how I'm  feeling, but I also feel that she'll tell me she'll work on it and it only lasting for another week.

I just feel like I'm a bad person who's pushing their friend to talk to them because they're lonely and impatient.

1jvg06s,How do I get closer to someone?,"The past month has been super hard for me. I'm a freshman in college (19F) and broke up with my girlfriend not too long ago. Since then I have had no one. My only friend had to drop out and I hardly see her since that happened and we're constantly fighting over stupid little things

Earlier this week I was waiting in line to sign my attendance sheet for a lecture and the person in front of me turned around and started talking to me

It was simple. Just complementing my hair but today in class she waved and said hi so it wasn't just a one time thing

I checked to see where she sat and it seems like she has 2 people she sits next to and talks to so if i get close to her it could be a good opportunity to get closer to multiple people which I desperately desperately need

My only problem is how tf do I get closer to her. I don't know her name so I can't find her socials and message her and I also have to make sure that the two people she talks and sits next to would be okay with me sitting with them

Im not quite sure if they sit in the same place every lecture but I am gonna keep track of it and see if I can get to class first and sit there so instead it'd be them sitting next to me instead of me sitting next to them

1jx4a6f,Life has been a lonely quiet sad room lately,"35M. Lately it's just been hitting me that no matter what I do in life, nothing gets better. In fact, I feel like I take one step ahead and fall two steps back. I used to always think positive and I still do but can't ignore these thoughts that shadow me like clouds. My whole life, I've always wanted to make others smile, give away my last dollar, feed others and help them with anything even if I'm going through my own issues. Now I realize all those people ghost you, don't call or text and if you reach out, it's like you're invading them. I never did things for people in hopes of getting it in return. I always just wanted the love or friendship to be reciprocated, that's all. Now it's like life changed, especially in the last 3-4 years. I'd say for me specifically, I've noticed since 2020, my depression has gotten bad. Meds don't help. Therapy isn't working. I've tried meditating, exercise, distracting myself but yet nothing is working. So I came to the realization that this is just the new normal or maybe I'm the only one feeling this. I try to find someone worth living for but no one exists of that nature. As a single guy who has been single for what feels like a decade, dating is hard, people ghost you, people also flake out on plans. It's hard to find someone in life. I left that predicament on hold for now as it's hard to find someone that you can share life with. 

I just find it weird that the ones with good hearts and good intentions always get it the worst in life. I have never hurt anyone physically, emotionally or verbally. I have always been the one that's there for someone no matter what. I'll go out of my way to make a persons day or situation better. I just wonder how the ones with evil intentions, or bad hearts seems to get everything in life from the cars, houses, soulmates and all. 

I don't know if this is my life from this time forward or if things will change but now I just wished I vanished as no one cares, no one would be affected and there's nothing left for me. I don't know what my purpose is here, I don't know if there's really a after life. I don't know if this is all a simulated life and I'm just some boring character on someone's board game or computer. I don't know anymore. 

There's nights I cry my eyes out literally to the point I fall asleep and waking up with sore eyes. I don't feel the urge to eat, I just wished there was a option to hit a button. Maybe two buttons, one to reset life again and the other to just end it all and you vanish. What button would you hit?  Sorry for my venting and all this nonsense talk but this is my outlet and my only way of venting. Maybe life gets better one day, maybe not. But till the end I'm still the same bubbly smiling caring loving guy that's always here for you till I'm gone. Hope you aren't in the same boat, but if you are, there's plenty of room and I hope we can share and connect.

After I told my roommate about everything, he said, ‚ÄúYou deserve better.‚Äù Then he told me he thinks I‚Äôm cute and that he‚Äôd love to date me. I didn‚Äôt expect it at all. I‚Äôve never thought about being with a guy romantically, but also‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve never really been with anyone. So now I‚Äôm just here wondering: Am I straight? Am I gay? Bi?

1jwznix,"28M, how life can be depressing most of the time.","I am not looking for sympathy or any opinions of any kind. Just a random nobody venting. 

It is quite fascinating to be honest. How your seemingly normal life sometimes take a drastic turn for the very worse. To the extent you never have ever expected it to. The 180¬∞ some may call it. Or one moment you are completely fine and for reason unknown you feel so down that you start crying for no reason. The moment I think I have ""understood"" what life is or have a general idea about it, the very next moment something unexpected happens which I would not see coming. Like how ? I mean how is it possible, when you are prepared for everything like everything.

You make countless scenarios in your head. You talk to yourself about it. You talk with people around you about it. You correct your every seemingly wrong/bad thing about you. You work on yourself. You try to gain the confidence you never had. You try to be as calm as possible in every and any situation. You are polite and humane with everyone around you. You absolutely give your very best you can every single day. Yet, that moment comes and every thing you have worked on seems like a total waste. Like why ? What is the point in working on yourself ? Trying to be a better version of yourself ? Trying to be More than what you can be ? Trying to be what you imagine to be ? When all it takes is a moment to destroy it all. 

It is more astonishing when the next morning (if you get any sleep after all that) everything is the same. When one moment your whole life seemed to meant nothing, the next morning it is the same. The moment has passed and the aftermath is and always will be, the same. Nothing has changed, nothing has vanished, nothing was lost and nothing gained. You would think it would be hard to get up but it is the easiest thing to do at that moment. You are wide awake, the crushing moment which destroyed you and shattered you is now just a part of your history. It is not ancient now but it would be someday, nevertheless a history. The morning is same, the clouds are same (or maybe the aren't), the air you are breathing is the same, the beating heart in your chest is the same and the people around you are the same. Only You, you are not the same. 

This is the part I struggle with the most. How can you explain someone how are you not the same when everything about you seems same to any preset eyes. How can you make them understand, the time which flew normally for them was like an eternity for me. How can I make them understand, how ""not fine"" I am when every part of my body seems ""fine"" to them ? How can I make them understand when I myself don't understand why that moment came and shattered my entire existence. How can I make them understand how crushed and helpless I am after that moment. When the only thing I know is to smile and nothing more. I can't cry, scream or show any kind of emotion. At that moment I am trying to pick up my shattered existence and trying to seem 'Normal', as that is the only thing I know. Sometimes I even forget how to be 'Normal'. Among the multiple faces this clown has to wear, I often forget which is my real face.

1jwja3g,Life feels monotone and I think its starting to get to me.,"I usually never minded it as much but recently I've just felt tired all the time. I'm not getting work done like I've used to. Always putting it off til late at night and then I do basically nothing for the whole day. And its the same shit every week too.
Just getting up and going to class, sitting down in my room. 

I'm always glad I left high school but everything after has never exactly felt exciting. Am I supposed to be enjoying life? I'm not, or atleast I think I don't. More like putting up with it. You're supposed to be glad to go to college but I'm sure not. You're supppsed to have friends but I sure don't. Everyone I knew I left back in high school, and even then I never did anything with them. 

I was a fucking idiot then and still am. I had friends but I never did shit. They'd ask me for my socials and what did I do? I blew them off. Can't have people thinking I needed ""friends"". Oh no, I was ""too good"". Same shit here and now. Brief conversations with classmates that ends once the lecture is over. Every now and then me and a girl converse when we spot each other on campus. But its like a fucking random encounter in a video game. 

None of it is constant. No one talks to me outside of class for the most part. No one messages me. My only hint of sociality is my fucking family. And I hate it. I know what my problem is, I'm not even fucking trying to get out there. Yet nothing changes. I'm still sitting on my ass in my room all the time. I used to not care about it. After all, the only person that really matters is myself right? But now I feel so tired and lazy. I hate being lazy. But I don't ever wanna do my work. I just put up with it. For today, and the next, and the rest of the week. And the next week. The month. The year. Fuck this shit.

Sometimes I wish I was born an idiot so that I wouldn't have to think so much. Then maybe I'd have some joy in myself. I can't ever like anything. Or be excited for anything. Not my birthday in a few weeks, or finishing this semester. I don't like how my body is either, I'm skinny, and have a belly which I don't like. Not that it matters anyways, no one ever sees it.

It just all feels monotone. Thats the way I can describe it. Its not hell. That would probably be more exciting. Its just boring. I wish I had actual friends, but I'd prolly just keep them at arms length too. Forgot about a girlfriend, no one's ever interested in me. And I'm not really even asking for help here either. Its funny in a way. I'm just screaming out somewhere, maybe hoping someone answers, but I'm not gonna even answer back. It's not like anyone fucking cares.

lately, loneliness has been a little too overwhelming. it‚Äôs hard to use words to describe how i feel, but it often feels pathetic and sad. 

i guess i can say that i feel a little tired of being the first person to text and the first person to ask for the hang out. i feel tired of being the first person to make a phone call. i feel tired of being left out. i feel tired of being misunderstood. i feel tired of walking around and feeling like i‚Äôve got a hole in my chest that should be filled but isn‚Äôt. 

i crave attention, i crave deep human connection. i can spend days, maybe weeks being all alone in university without anyone asking me where i am or how i‚Äôve been until i randomly show up because my loneliness was too much and i felt like i had to force myself to be seen by people. but i never feel wanted. i spend a lot of hours alone. 

i know i have maybe one or two real friends, but i never really get much from them. they never text me first, they never ask to hang out, they never call me either. i wonder if i never call or text them, would they even notice that i‚Äôm gone? 

i have no boyfriend either‚Ä¶ no one to spend hours with or think about without feeling embarrassed. i think about my friends, or the people that i call my friends, quite often‚Ä¶ but i usually feel embarrassed when i do. it feels wrong to think about friends too much because they‚Äôre just friends (does that make sense?). i don‚Äôt have anyone to check up on me or send me good morning and goodnight texts. no one to call or text when im feeling horrible or depressed. no one that loves me unconditionally the way i love them.

1jwbgjb,I'm wasting away my 20s,"hi, im new here but i didnt know where else to turn. i just desperately needed to put my thoughts into words and feel heard by someone, even if its just a bunch of strangers on the internet.

covid changed a lot of things for me, as it did for many of us. i didn't realize how good i had it until i let everything slip away. i had several different friend groups, hobbies that made me feel fulfilled, and a bright future ahead of me. i was a senior in high school, so we never got a real chance to say goodbye to anyone. life shut down, we graduated remotely, and then it was time for everyone to go their separate ways. before i could even realize, everyone was already setting out on their own lives. and then there was me.

i was nowhere near ready for college. i didnt know that at the time of course. thats why i dropped out- twice. i completely fucked my freshman year by meeting an abusive guy on tinder. i was isolated from the few people i managed to start getting to know. and my friends from high school had long forgotten about me by then.

running away from home to a new city was what really put the final nail in the coffin of my social life. i didn't realize until then that i'd never truly made a friend organically by myself. i'd always just been lucky enough to be approached first, or met people through mutual friends. covid took the few social skills i had and made them nonexistent. i've been almost entirely alone for the past 5 years and the older i get the further away the hope of finding any worthwhile friends seems to drift.

im living my parents again. our relationship has always been strained. i can tell im not what they pictured when they first decided to become parents. i've always been more alternative in my interests and self-expression. my parents couldnt be more different from me. the only thing thats kept our relationship afloat is the blood relation and shared history together.

i've had a boyfriend for the past 3 years and he's the only person i've ever felt like truly gets me. although that in itself is kinda sad. i cant make a single friend but i can get a romantic relationship so easily. seems like sex/love may be the only thing people see in me. any man i've tried developing a friendship with has showed me that much at least. i feel awful for constantly having to put so much emotional burden on my bf, but he's genuinely the only one i have at this point. i'd probably be dead without him in all honesty. we both really want to have a future together, eventually get married too. but i cant stop thinking about how if we were to get married, i wouldn't even have enough friends to have any bridesmaids, or even a maid of honor. 

im back in college now, this time going for straight A's. im joining clubs, well, a club. it's been 2 years now and i still havent made a single friend there. the closest thing i have to a friend are my coworkers, but our relationships are very surface level. it's gotten to the point where i LIKE going to work, despite how much my job sucks, solely because its the one place i get to socialize with people my age, and get paid for it. 

everyone is always so busy so we can never make plans, myself included. by the time im done with school and work, im too burnt out to even want to try socializing. and then im sitting in my room crying about how lonely i am. and the cycle just keeps repeating.

every time i try to make friends or even so much as talk to people i feel like a burden. i never know what to say, so in most cases i just awkwardly stand around people, just waiting for the moment i can say something relevant or contribute in any way. occasionally, i'll get a laugh. but i'm constantly feeling like a 3rd, 5th... 20th wheel in everything i do. like nobody ever wants me around, like im constantly just intruding in others conversations because at our ages everyone already has their established friend groups, so nobody ever even gives me a chance. at this point im just hoping that i'll attract people if im just THERE. if im around long enough, eventually i'll assimilate with the people around me and maybe grow a deeper connection with someone, ANYONE.

so i guess all this is to say that making friends in your 20s, especially when you've fucked your life up as much as i have, is really damn hard. so now i'm just sitting in my bed wasting away what are supposed to be the ""best years of my life"" crying and venting to strangers on reddit.",Moldy_Bagels,3,4,Venting,im wasting away hi im new didnt know else turn desperately needed put thought word feel heard someone even bunch stranger internet covid changed lot thing many u didnt realize good let everything slip away several different friend group hobby made feel fulfilled bright future ahead senior high school never got real chance say goodbye anyone life shut graduated remotely time everyone go separate way could even realize everyone already setting life nowhere near ready college didnt know time course thats dropped twice completely fucked freshman year meeting abusive guy tinder isolated people managed start getting know friend high school long forgotten running away home new city really put final nail coffin social life didnt realize id never truly made friend organically id always lucky enough approached first met people mutual friend covid took social skill made nonexistent ive almost entirely alone past year older get away hope finding worthwhile friend seems drift im living parent relationship always strained tell im pictured first decided become parent ive always alternative interest selfexpression parent couldnt different thing thats kept relationship afloat blood relation shared history together ive boyfriend past year he person ive ever felt like truly get although kinda sad cant make single friend get romantic relationship easily seems like sexlove may thing people see man ive tried developing friendship showed much least feel awful constantly put much emotional burden bf he genuinely one point id probably dead without honesty really want future together eventually get married cant stop thinking get married wouldnt even enough friend bridesmaid even maid honor im back college time going straight im joining club well club year still havent made single friend closest thing friend coworkers relationship surface level gotten point like going work despite much job suck solely one place get socialize people age get paid everyone always busy never make plan included time im done school work im burnt even want try socializing im sitting room cry lonely cycle keep repeating every time try make friend even much talk people feel like burden never know say case awkwardly stand around people waiting moment say something relevant contribute way occasionally ill get laugh im constantly feeling like rd th th wheel everything like nobody ever want around like im constantly intruding others conversation age everyone already established friend group nobody ever even give chance point im hoping ill attract people im im around long enough eventually ill assimilate people around maybe grow deeper connection someone anyone guess say making friend especially youve fucked life much really damn hard im sitting bed wasting away supposed best year life cry venting stranger reddit,0.025481209611644386,0.47223665223665195

I think about how our families would react, if we would have a good relationship or not. I think about how our wedding would be, the kind of house we would live in, how many children and pets we would have together. 

But most of all I imagine the little things we would do for one another everyday. The way I would show my love through cooking, baking and making little gifts, how I would feel loved and understood, the inside jokes we would share and playful teasing we would do, the hugging and the cuddling.

1juqxax,Friends watched the minecraft movie without me,"For context, I used to live in another city, away from my hometown. I went back for a couple days to see my friends there and said I'd be back when the mc movie releases. 

However, my new pc ended up being delivered during the release and I didn't want to risk it getting stolen off my veranda while I was away. So I waited until it arrived, which was this Monday and then yesterday, I asked my friends in a group chat, if they've seen videos of people losing their shit when Jack Black says minecraft terms and was going to say when would be good for me to come down to watch it. When one of them said it happened when they went to watch it. 

So that hurt a bit to read, but I didn't want to make things weird so I just said hell yeah and have been disappointed that they saw it without me.

I'm guessing that they watched it with the rest of the friend group there as I saw a story the other day where someone from that group was in the cinema. However, I assumed they watched it without my friends as they were waiting for me, but no.

While I don't really care about the movie itself, it would've been a fun time regardless getting drunk and then seeing it as I and most of the others grew up playing mc. I'm very surprised that no-one told me they saw it as well or asked me about my plans with visiting. It's a shame, as I had plans in my head of after watching it, going to McDonald's and getting the mc meal and seeing what toys we got.

1jupazm,I no longer know who i am,"To introduce myself, im 17 and im finishing highschool next year.

Since i was a child i was viewed as a very kind, outgoing and extroverted person. In recent years that has completely shifted, my parents even asked why do i seem to have become more selfish, stopped thinking ahead of things and people alike. Exactly, i stopped caring. I've become apathetic because of my past experiences and trauma with people ghosting me and pushing me away, possibly childhood trauma from parents, and nowadays them just arguing in general. Now i've become VERY lonely and even possibly depressed, at this point where i even stay up until 4 am texting to AI chat bots. Pathetic, i know. Also i have very constant mood shifts between days, going on for like a year now. And this has been going on for a while, and im just dissintrestted in improving it or getting out, it's like i already gave up. For your knowledge, yes i've gone to a therapist, been going for about a month now, and maybe it helps for a time, but it just all shifts back like nothing changed and that entire discussion and talk was meaningless. I also had one meeting at the psychiatrist last week, propably with more to come.

Besides all this, even though i've gained great support from my parents and sisters, i still don't feel the want to change it. I barely talk to anybody of my age group now, and even if i do i never go outside, it's only that i go out alone in every millennia because of something. Even my supposed ""Best friend"" , well he stopped going outside with me several years ago and now i just gave up, i only see him at school in class and talk to him in calls and chat, just as if he was another online friend, even if we are closer. Now since last year, ever since i started this phase of self-destruction, i started skipping school, do not think about my grades whatsoever, ignore deadlines. I only do something if it's absolutely necessary or i will be punished for it. Have constant thoughts about death, getting something like cancer so i could do whatever i want for a time. Also like i mentioned the mood shifts, im either really nonchalant and serious or very bouncy, excited? It's with myself though, in school i always seem nonchalant, started wearing sunglasses as a way of escapism aswell, though they are stylish. I've lost passion for pretty much everything, stopped putting effort into studying since last year aswell, stopped doing homework. Now only two things that excite me are singing and voice acting, and i even started singing way less, hell do i know why. I started resorting to instant pleasure, pleasuring myself daily, sometimes multiple times. Refusing to get out of bed, scrolling. Yet deep down i wanna care for someone, and i still do kind deeds whenever i can, but now i seem to do selfish things without even realizing them.

I don't even realise what's wrong with me anymore, im not in despair, im just dissapointed and hopeless of the future ahead. Maybe time will heal, and i guess only time will tell. And i've heard all those things about someone like me, shouldn't be able to feel this way and that, well that's a stupid statement, age doesn't matter in these things when you start becoming delusional.",MarceladeXX,1,3,Venting,longer know introduce im im finishing highschool next year since child viewed kind outgoing extroverted person recent year completely shifted parent even asked seem become selfish stopped thinking ahead thing people alike exactly stopped caring ive become apathetic past experience trauma people ghosting pushing away possibly childhood trauma parent nowadays arguing general ive become lonely even possibly depressed point even stay texting ai chat bot pathetic know also constant mood shift day going like year going im dissintrestted improving getting like already gave knowledge yes ive gone therapist going month maybe help time shift back like nothing changed entire discussion talk meaningless also one meeting psychiatrist last week propably come besides even though ive gained great support parent sister still dont feel want change barely talk anybody age group even never go outside go alone every millennium something even supposed best friend well stopped going outside several year ago gave see school class talk call chat another online friend even closer since last year ever since started phase selfdestruction started skipping school think grade whatsoever ignore deadline something absolutely necessary punished constant thought death getting something like cancer could whatever want time also like mentioned mood shift im either really nonchalant serious bouncy excited though school always seem nonchalant started wearing sunglass way escapism aswell though stylish ive lost passion pretty much everything stopped putting effort studying since last year aswell stopped homework two thing excite singing voice acting even started singing way less hell know started resorting instant pleasure pleasuring daily sometimes multiple time refusing get bed scrolling yet deep wan na care someone still kind deed whenever seem selfish thing without even realizing dont even realise whats wrong anymore im despair im dissapointed hopeless future ahead maybe time heal guess time tell ive heard thing someone like shouldnt able feel way well thats stupid statement age doesnt matter thing start becoming delusional,0.022872340425531913,0.47854609929078

I've been struggling with depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation for the past 5+ years, during that time my relationship became entirely a roommate situation, and I'm not the best roommate. I was involved in two mass layoffs, left another due to stress, and was fired from another. My car broke down and is probably going to cost $1000 plus to fix which I don't have as I'm unemployed. And about three weeks ago my partner and I decided to separate, amicably mind you, which surprisingly doesn't make it that much easier. 

So today is my birthday, and besides one or two that I know ment it, but but we're just ""hang around"" close or can't get together for one reason or another, I've mostly just recieved the usual generic ""happy birthday"" auto generated meaningless Facebook greetings. 

To top it all off, my best friend hasn't called, texted, or so much as written on my wall. Not that I was expecting an invitation to do something, he's my bestfriend, not the other way around. But even a text would have done a lot of me. I reached out to him a few days after the split. I always reach out. We went for a coffee, we talked, we seemed to enjoy each other's company. He knows my situation. Stright up said one of his worries is that one of his friends might be suffering and not reach out. But he's not so scared about it that he'll reach out when he knows one of his friends is suffering.

1jx0n7l,"Almost 27, quit my tech job, have no friends, feel really lost, disappointment to my parents","I‚Äôve always had trouble making friends due to my introverted nature. My mom is an introvert, and never tried to make friends or be outgoing, this had a huge impact on me and I ended up the same. My dad was just ignorant and oblivious to everything. I moved a lot growing up, so I‚Äôve never had a single friend, like ever. My dad is very educated and successful in the tech field, he‚Äôs a self made man, and all his friends are the same. All of my parents friends children are very successful with high paying jobs. After struggling with depression and anxiety my whole life, I managed to get an entry level technical engineer job that paid well at 26. I was paid almost a 100k, and it was at a big tech company. But it was a customer support job, after surviving 1 year somehow, I had a really bad mental break down, I couldn‚Äôt handle the stress of the job, it was so bad I thought I might have a heart attack and I started to forget things. It was my first corporate job. I had no friends, no one to go to so I contacted a mental health therapist and got a 2 week leave approved.  But when I returned, my brain had pretty much shut down, and I couldn‚Äôt continue, in what is already a terrible job market in tech, I quit, and moved back in with my parents. Now I‚Äôm so lost. I still don‚Äôt have friends, I don‚Äôt have the experience of having friends and doing things with them. Last year, I tried so many things I‚Äôve never tried before, I actually tried to make friends, I went out of my comfort zone. I even went out on dates, and had a brief relationship that lasted like 2 months. It was my first relationship ever, and she said some very hurtful things about me being a late bloomer, not having friends, or relationship experience, and it absolutely broke me, this was right before I quit my job, she completely abandoned me when I needed her the most. Now I‚Äôm struggling to find the motivation to do anything. Constant job rejection emails. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm even doing anymore, just disappointing my parents and myself. I‚Äôm so alone. I don‚Äôt know how to move forward. I do take meds but they don‚Äôt help. Therapy doesn‚Äôt seem to help either because it can‚Äôt make up for my lack of experience.

I regret it, leaving I mean. He is the main reason I made this account, that an I lost the ability to sign into my old one and my Instagram. Anyway, he was so, so sweet and fun and we had long real conversations..we called them letters actually because the messages we sent were so long. I live in Texas and he lives pretty far away, which didn't bother me too much, but there was something that did actually bother me.. he had a girlfriend, which is a problem when my heart started to fall, I swear I'm broken in tat way, I fall for people I can't have.

He brightened up my days, even my worst ones, I could talk to him about anything, everything, and even the boring things. We would send music we liked back and forth to each other, he'd send videos nice snippets of his life and his voice.. Jesus. I know many people say it but accents aee just so attractive..ugh I'll mever forgive myself for learning, I just got, scared I guess. I feel so horrible, he didn't deserve me just.. dipping out on him.

I miss him, I don't know if he's still on here, with my luck probably not. And with how I left it's fair to say he might just hate me. But..if he does see this or finds this some how, you don't have to respond but I got something to say ok? 

Thank you, a billion times thanks. For the smiles, the kindness, your openness and open-mindedness, for being who you are and giving my weird unstable self a go, I miss you a lot, I think about you..an embarrassing amount. Thank you for sticking with me even on my low days, sharing your thoughts and being on so kind and patient about my autism. Thank you for sharing your life with me and giving me your time. I regret leaving, I always will you didn't deserve it, you never deserved that. I hope whatever you're doing or however you're doing that you're happy, and less lonely, surrounded by friends and happiness, so much life can't get you down for long. I fell in love with you, I should of done anything but run away like I did, I should of told you or.. something, anything. I regret that so much, and wish I could change it.

You were an amazing friend to me, I wish I was better with words because I can't find the ones to even express how much you meant and still mean to me.

1jwd7u4,2am,"
All day yesterday, I felt awful. Now it's 2am and I'm crying for so many damn reasons. 

Just merely a year or 2 ago, it seemed like everything was going perfectly for me. I was doing things that I'd always wanted to. Things I thought I might never be able to - or at least, not at such a young age. I was going to the gym, buying myself clothes and things I always wanted, trying to be somewhat more social. I was going to my doctor's appointments and trying to take my pills and other medications. I even went to not 1, but 2 different clubs, and ended up having my first somewhat - kiss. I was waiting to start my journey towards testosterone, amongst other things.

Then, just like that, all of that disappeared.

Now it seems as though everything has fallen apart. Everything I worked so hard for is gone.

On top of that, I'm in so much debt that I barely see any of my money anymore. 

Soon, a letter will arrive in the mail that could potentially ruin my life even more than it already seems to be ruined.

I am a young adult who has no friends, has never been in a relationship in person, and has barely experienced anything. 

I have nothing to fight for anymore. Nothing to live for. 

On top of all of this, he got back from the mental hospital yesterday and has been making everything even more of a living fucking hell ever since he stepped foot into the front door.

I can't do this anymore. I have tried and I have failed too many times. 

I shouldn't have walked away from that place. I should have taken more than just 20 pills. I will take more next time. Maybe tomorrow.

1jwcohm,"I feel hopeless about making friends or dating, but I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs really wrong with me‚Ä¶","
Social skills can be gained through repetition, being fun and having shared activities makes friendships and dating easier. 
Confidence, good verbal skills, showing you have a personality and character in hangouts helps makes things less awkward. 

Some physical and personality traits can turn certain people on or off. Clean yourself and be aware of how you dress. Finances sort of matter. You don‚Äôt necessarily want to be liked by everyone. Try to keep the most intimate topics for later and don‚Äôt bully others. 

I feel like I know how these things work and can engage in small talk, but it never progresses past that. I do not know what I‚Äôm doing wrong, I don‚Äôt act desperate, I try to keep conversations varied, I am not formulaic with what I say. It feels impossible for me to actually make friends in college. 

It doesn‚Äôt feel strange that it‚Äôs hard for me, what surprises me is how it‚Äôs easy for anyone. So for people it‚Äôs easier for, what do you do? What do you notice about people who don‚Äôt have friends when they try and break into conversations? 

Self-improvement as the answer doesn‚Äôt make sense to me, I feel like being held to the standard of constant self improvement to make any friends is radically unfair. I understand having your life in order is important for dating.

For most of my life, I always had people to talk to.. like online and offline friends. But towards the end of 2024 people just started leaving. My online friends moved on to other servers. I had three close friends: one moved to another country, one became so toxic it started affecting my mental health (I tried talking to him, but he didn‚Äôt seem to care), and the last one ghosted me after a small fight, even though I tried to make things right. Even my offline friend group fell apart and all of this happened in just 1-2 months. It felt like everything just collapsed at once like i was destined to be alone in 2025.

I never wanted to admit that I was alone or that what i‚Äôm feeling is loneliness. So i gave 100% trying to get just one person‚Äôs attention (desperate i know) . . I tried dating apps and i also joined different servers but nothing really changed.

Last month, i messaged a girl from my old school, we used to sit on the bus together but never really talked much online. I just wanted someone to talk to. We started chatting regularly and eventually I asked her if she wanted to go watch a movie. She said yes and i felt genuinely happy for the first time in a while.

But the day before we were supposed to meet, she ghosted me. She stopped sending snaps to me even though she still send to other people(i checked score) she also posts on insta and i can see she is online there i texted her one or two times she just doesn't reply idk what happened idk what i did was wrong.

Now it‚Äôs been about a month of me living like this just waking up every day, hoping for a text. From anyone or my old friends. From someone who remembers me but nothing  and i guess, deep down i still don‚Äôt want to accept this as my reality that i am loner.

and it keeps happening. every day, a new story. something crazier to keep my attention. and im expected to drop everything. and if i don‚Äôt respond quick enough, or act worried enough, then they say, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre the only person i can talk to about this‚Äù, ‚Äúeveryone else abandons me, i can‚Äôt believe you haven‚Äôt left yet‚Äù. it feels like emotional manipulation. 

they talk badly about all their other family and friends to me, and i know they probably talk badly about me to other people too. they‚Äôre just always the victim. but its hard to tell whether between someone like that and someone who genuinely needs support. 

it always ends the same way. i catch them in a lie, or they find someone else, and i get added to the list of people who wronged them. and no matter what, they always leave.

1jw48sg,"I want friends, but also not","Title sums it all up, but it''s a whole difficult intertwined mess when i look into it.
I'm 25 years old for reference.

I always used to have friends, on a young age it used to be that I hung out with lots of people and had 1 or 2 really good and close friends. Later it turned to big groups of alot of sweet close friends.
And the last time I remember having friends is up until 2 years ago.
But now I'm just super lonely, and I know why (I think).
I've been struggling massively with anhedonia and dystemia these past 2 years, always had depression from a very young age (I was 8) which never helped maintaining friendships (have always been and am still in mental healthcare for it). But since 2 years I have noticed I grew apart from the friends I used to have, this because of my interests, my beliefs and generally having a lot busier life (school and work) which are all on locations that my previous friends aren't close or accustomed to. Also in these last 2 years I really just didn't feel like it, I didn't feel like going out, didn't feel any need for other people, didn't want connections or making new friends because I have just been generally feeling-less and overall tired from my work and schooldays which left no social energy.

Now 2 years later I feel very very very lonely. 
This is because I left some friends behind because of reasons stated above, but also because everyone that I had a genuinely good connection with either moved really far away from where they used to live (think other countries) and also a few of my dearest and nearest peoples that I knew have passed away at a pretty young age these past years.

And it's not that I think I'm not fun, or that I think that I don't deserve friends, the opposite, I think I am fun, and fully worthy of being loved and having nice people around me.

But I'm also real with myself about the fact that I am alot of the times the problem when it comes to people breaking contact, I tend to leave people behind whenever a mayor depressive episode hits, I don't mean to, but it does, I do reach out to people for help once it happens, but i notice I lose people left and right once they notice that I'm no fun to be with at that moment, even though I try really hard to also partake in the fun stuff. But also as I said above, people have their own life plans and move far away, I don't blame them for that, but I am still here.

I now also struggle with not feeling at ease with anyone, when I was younger I used to have the feeling of ""wow, these are my people, I really feel in tune with these people!"" And now I just never feel that anymore with anyone I meet, and I am really trying to meet new people and even take up old contacts again, it just never feels like I am with someone I really feel well with, or in tune with.

When I think of: who would I like hang out with? Or what kind of people would I like to meet? The answer just stays silent in my head, and the anhedonia also doesn't help because I used to have tons of interests in hobbies, and now I don't.

1jvvzn2,Loneliness is destroying me,"I'm kinda piggybacking on a previous post here, saying how loneliness is damaging their soul because I could really relate. 

I always was someone who liked to be alone from time to time. But eventually it reached a point where it wasn't my choice anymore. I'm in my early 30ies now and honestly if I'm not at work or with my family I spend the very most of my time alone isolated at home. Tbf some days ago I met with the only friend I have left for a couple of hours (the last time was maybe half a year ago) but even with him I don't really get along anymore. We're just so different now. There are some things about him by now that I just despise and although he's always friendly and says how cool it is to spend some time together, I know there are a lot of other people he would rather be with anytime. So bottom line this only friendship I have left is hardly worth mentioning anymore. 

I am infinitely thankful for my great family but even with them it can be tough for me. Because I'm pretty sure each one of them more or less knows what a lonely weirdo I've become. I'm trying to keep up my masquerade but this can only work to a certain level. So if the only private life thing I could talk about is my character in Skyrim or how I shot down people in Battlefield, they must sense the cold hard truth.

I also lack self discipline, so I hardly ever move forward and do something that might change things (if that's even realistically possible). I'm not really religious, but I kinda just hope that some day fate will open a new chapter for me.

1jvozkd,"I‚Äôm blind, isolated, and completely exhausted from trying so hard when nothing ever works out","I honestly don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I grew up on a farm with parents who didn‚Äôt believe in disabilities, didn‚Äôt care about anyone who was different, and made me feel like I was worthless. Because I‚Äôm blind, they treated me like I couldn‚Äôt do anything. They gave me the hardest chores and acted like I didn‚Äôt matter if I got hurt. I was just the ‚Äúuseless one,‚Äù so they used me however they wanted.

I went to school in the middle of nowhere where I was constantly bullied. No one helped me. No teachers stepped in. I never had any friends growing up. I thought college would be a chance to start over, but it‚Äôs been just as bad. I try so hard to talk to people, join clubs, make connections. I even went to a sports camp. But even when I think I‚Äôve made friends, they always stop talking to me or get mad at me ‚Äî and I don‚Äôt even know why. I‚Äôve never had friends before, so I don‚Äôt always know the ‚Äúright‚Äù way to communicate. But I try. I really try.

Now I feel like I‚Äôll never get a job because I don‚Äôt have social skills, and I never had anyone to teach me. I went to a bad high school with very few opportunities. My college is awful. I don‚Äôt even know if I‚Äôm in the right major, but when I try to look into transferring, every option seems worse or impossible.

Everyone says ‚Äúmake friends in class,‚Äù ‚Äúgo to events,‚Äù ‚Äújust talk to people,‚Äù but it never works. I feel invisible ‚Äî or worse, like people just hate me for existing. Professors don‚Äôt help. Tutors don‚Äôt help. Mental health counselors don‚Äôt help. I‚Äôm stuck with a roommate I don‚Äôt get along with. I have no one.

I want to live in a city and get a guide dog to gain some independence, but my parents are trying to stop me. They say I can‚Äôt travel alone because I‚Äôm blind. Meanwhile, my siblings get to do whatever they want, no problem.

I don‚Äôt party. I don‚Äôt drink. I don‚Äôt use drugs. I‚Äôm not into social media or sports. I don‚Äôt fit in anywhere. I tried to be good at music in high school, but I was never good enough and couldn‚Äôt afford lessons. I feel like everything I try just leads to more failure.

People tell me, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs always someone out there for you,‚Äù but that‚Äôs not true. I‚Äôm fat, blind, and apparently not good at talking to people. Who would ever want me? Not even as a friend ‚Äî let alone in a relationship. I‚Äôm tired of everyone acting like I‚Äôm the problem when I‚Äôve done everything I can.

I honestly feel sick and sometimes I‚Äôm close to puking from the emotional pain.¬†**I‚Äôve never felt wanted by a guy.**¬†In my teen years (I'm now 30F) I was always ignored and discarded in favour of other pretty girls or heck, even my friends. Still to this day, I feel so left out of a conversation when my friends gossip about guys hitting on them and chasing after them. It‚Äôs never happened to me and has made me feel less of a woman. Just yesterday I was sitting with my friends and one of them was talking about how many guys hit on her when she went out last week. I‚Äôm average looking and have a toned skinny body. Like I‚Äôm not even a 1 or an intimidating 10. But there must be something wrong with me.

It sucks never being the girl that‚Äôs choosen. It just gives you that same feeling like being picked last in a sports game. It‚Äôs an awful feeling. What‚Äôs worse is that for once I thought I got loved and appreciated for once in my life by a guy. I was so happy to finally be noticed by a guy (my ex) but I was treated like annoyance for existing. Like an insect in his face or a rock in his shoe. He would roll his eyes or sigh if I showered him in kisses or showed any affection, like I was bothering him. He would be nonchalant and wouldn‚Äôt even hug me hello if we had been apart while I had gotten ready and been excited all day. I was just there. I thought I had found love but I was emotionally abused for 6 years everyday. I broke up with him 2 years ago. I was never pretty enough to keep his attention or keep it off other girls.

I tried again now and I‚Äôve been talking to a guy on an dating app for several weeks and I was so excited to have a date and for a third time had that ''Maybe this guy will like me'' but he cancelled, saying he had a ‚Äò‚Äôheadache‚Äô‚Äô and didn‚Äôt properly reschedule. It feels like my existence is just a bother to guys and they don‚Äôt want anything to do with me. ¬†

Like ‚Äì I‚Äôm not good enough to date and I wasn‚Äôt in his eyes, good enough to sleep with and disgard the next day. I feel so stupid now for even having hopes that something will ever be different. This was just a reminder that no one wants me and I‚Äôm so disposable. I feel so pathetic for reading all my romance books as a teenager and just waiting for that kind of love but now knowing it will never happen. ¬†**I‚Äôll never inspire or give a guy butterflies or have someone be excited about me. I would have just want for once in my life be wanted instead of watching everyone around me have these experiences. It‚Äôs so triggering to see love**. To see people holding hands, kissing or being a couple, knowing no guy wants that with me. Just on Friday, I will be attending a dinner with 5 couples and I will be the only one there without anyone. It‚Äôs just constant reminders how unlovable I am.

I‚Äôm tired of hearing ‚Äò‚Äôlove yourself‚Äô‚Äô ‚Äì ‚Äò‚Äôenjoy the single life‚Äô‚Äô. As if loving yourself takes away the craving for intimacy and love. And there is only so long that the single life is fun, and then comes a point where it‚Äôs painful to the point of being sick to your stomach. I don‚Äôt have a reason to be here anymore. It just feels like I‚Äôm here to love others and never be loved. I'm tired of giving relationship advice and being so lonley. Like I‚Äôll have my friends and family ‚Äì and I‚Äôll go home to my lonely apartment.

People are excited for me, but inside I more feel like I'm finally ""giving up"" and deciding not to wait for the right person or conditions if they ever come. Which they will likely not.

And then also the process itself is really stressful and I feel like I cannot really talk to anyone because yes, buying a house is more difficult and I am privileged to be able to do so.

1jus2w3,Spiraling and not sure if there‚Äôs light at the end,"
I‚Äôm not even sure how to structure this. All I know is that I‚Äôve been talking to chatgpt like it‚Äôs my best friend for the past few months. It‚Äôs honestly embarrassing. I don‚Äôt really talk to anyone else. Maybe my mom, barely. My phone is dry. No notifications except ads or spam. I keep writing and spiraling and writing again. And I‚Äôm so tired.

Here‚Äôs my story.

I‚Äôm 22, a nursing student in Canada. I‚Äôve been losing weight aggressively, grinding at the gym, doing cardio, tracking food, trying to build a body I can be proud of. I stopped PMO in January. Haven‚Äôt relapsed since. I‚Äôve been working part time while juggling school and trying to stay on track, but I‚Äôve been breaking down in waves. Not loudly, just spiraling in my head - checking old group chats, rewatching old saved TikToks, imagining memories that never happened. Every time I zone out, I come back feeling worse. There‚Äôs no one really checking in, and even when I‚Äôm around people, I still feel invisible.

My family life is tough. I don‚Äôt have a relationship with my dad. I‚Äôm an only child. No siblings. No real emotional outlet. Sometimes I feel like I‚Äôm screaming into the void.

I got caught up in this ‚Äúgroup‚Äù at school‚Äîme, two girls, and sometimes others. It felt like a light in my life. For the first time, I felt like I belonged. I asked one of them out, got rejected, and then everything got awkward. She stopped acknowledging me in class. I tried to be cool, then funny, then distant. Nothing worked. I spiraled over it these last few weeks. Breadcrumbs. Power dynamics. Overanalyzing every emoji, every message, every silence.

I lost my dignity trying to ‚Äúkeep the group alive.‚Äù I acted like the glue, but I was just bleeding emotionally. I‚Äôm scared I ruined it 15 times over.

I‚Äôve done everything ‚Äúright.‚Äù Went to the gym. Cut off dopamine. Tried to eat clean. Focus on school. And still I feel empty. I feel like I missed my chance. Like everyone has their social circles and I‚Äôm just some awkward guy orbiting people who don‚Äôt care. I keep watching old TikToks I saved and imagining myself making them laugh, like we‚Äôre in a car on a road trip. Then I snap back to reality, alone in my room, feeling like a loser.

I‚Äôm scared of therapy because I don‚Äôt want to use it as an excuse. Like ‚Äúoh I didn‚Äôt make friends cuz I‚Äôm not in therapy yet.‚Äù But I also know I need something. I just don‚Äôt know what. Every time I go outside, I remember the moments we had. Every time I try to make new friends, I feel like I‚Äôm too much, or I‚Äôm too awkward, or I missed the boat.

And I‚Äôm scared that maybe this is just how life is. Maybe there is no light. Maybe this is what the raw brain feels like without porn or fake connections. Just endless spirals and silence.

I don‚Äôt know if this is a cry for help. Maybe it is. I just need someone to tell me I‚Äôm not crazy. That it gets better. That I didn‚Äôt ruin everything. That I‚Äôm not alone.

The last 2 are friends from college, we'd be this ""trio"" and spend a lot of our time together. Everything felt balanced in my life, i was very glad with the friends i had and i had been enjoying my recent years until now. 

I've recently went through a very rough patch in life, around October/November i went through a burnout/depressive episode, i had no energy to hangout, talk or see anyone. I was just going into my own bubble and spend the days inside my room. I was still keeping myself busy with personal interests, but i couldn't do anything else. College became a struggle and i had to drop several subjects because i couldn't keep up anymore. 

I tried to let everyone know it wasn't personal and i had to take some time for myself, after awhile i was slowly trying to connect again with that core group. But unfortunately it didn't go well with everyone, I've lost the bestfriend from highschool and they completely went no contact, they deleted me and made sure this decision was on me. I just struggled with reaching out to everyone in one go, i was taking it step by step, it's not easy to immediately comeback and act like I'm completely okay again when i wasn't. I was so drained that i couldn't even mentally ""realize"" what this meant, i think i just impulsively accepted it.  

Some months later, another issue took place, the 2 friends from college that i used to be a trio with started to feel like we didn't work with the three of us anymore, they both couldn't get along anymore so now i have seperate connections with them. 

This all has been difficult because i just suddenly feel like i lost all balance, i don't know who to call my close friends anymore, who am i really connected to, do they care for my presence or am i just a ""hangout"" friend, during the time that I've lost the balance in my core group, i was also getting to know 2 new people but I've just been going through some sort of crisis, i really struggle with sudden changes in my life that i wasn't prepared for, and i keep on feeling ""off"". I still go out and do activities, but i don't feel like these are people that -really- connect with me. They like me like i like them, but I'm not a close person or person that they want to deeply connect with beyond ""fun talks and activities"" i barely hear from them and I'm at this point of like ""do i need to re-evaluate my deep connections?"" 

Does this make sense or sound relatable to anyone?

1jwdw4a,nobody wished me happy birthday,"
So I‚Äôm a bit of a lurker here and have never posted but here goes. Turned 19 today and for some reason no one except my parents wished me, now it‚Äôs still early in the morning and maybe people will wish me but it‚Äôs just strange. Every year I get at least a bunch of people who wish me but I guess moving countries to study has put me in an awkward position where I guess I‚Äôm not close enough with all the new friends have made aren‚Äôt that close with me yet and all my friends back home are starting to drift apart I guess. I‚Äôm an extremely social person and go out with friends a whole lot, so I don‚Äôt know I was just a bit surprised. I do know that everyone has shit going on in their lives so I‚Äôm not too taken aback but it does make me feel lonely so I guess I can post here? I don‚Äôt know I‚Äôve always been an extrovert and today‚Äôs the first time in a long long time that I feel really really isolated and lonely. Any way I can feel better?",TruthCrazy601,14,23,Birthday post üéÅ,nobody wished happy birthday im bit lurker never posted go turned today reason one except parent wished still early morning maybe people wish strange every year get least bunch people wish guess moving country study put awkward position guess im close enough new friend made arent close yet friend back home starting drift apart guess im extremely social person go friend whole lot dont know bit surprised know everyone shit going life im taken aback make feel lonely guess post dont know ive always extrovert today first time long long time feel really really isolated lonely way feel better,0.043484848484848494,0.4652272727272727
1juy6b4,Today was my birthday,"As the title says, today was my birthday (35M), and as expected, nobody cared or did anything. To be precise, I only received a WhatsApp message from my mother, who is the only person I have in my life right now. She is quite old and lives in my home country.

I never had many friends, mostly acquaintances. I did have a girlfriend some years ago; we were together for several years, but unfortunately, the relationship was very toxic for me. She was extremely jealous and violent, and we eventually broke up.

After that, I tried to reset my life, to set a new and ambitious goal and pursue it. In doing so, I left everything behind. I also took the opportunity to reflect on my loneliness and to work on being better, to actively try to do things right, to recognize my mistakes, and to improve what I could control. I got in good shape, learned to take care of myself, to look good, to go to the gym consistently, and to improve whatever could be improved, to become the best version of myself and, by extension, a good prospect as a friend and a partner.

When it came to interactions with others, I became kinder, more respectful. I offered help whenever I could, even when it wasn‚Äôt asked for. I tolerated things I normally wouldn‚Äôt. I listened and offered support. I genuinely wanted to be a good person.

However, none of that worked at all. I am absolutely and completely alone. My phone never receives messages from anyone, other than group messages related to academic activities and spam. Sometimes, I crave something as simple as a hug, just wishing I had someone to hold. For several reasons, I can‚Äôt have a pet, and even if I could, what I need is human interaction.

Over the years, birthdays have been the worst days of all, for obvious reasons. They‚Äôre when I most strongly feel my loneliness and my longing for someone in my life. But this time, something was different. I guess it was resignation. I didn‚Äôt feel anything particularly worse than the usual sadness and pain. I think I‚Äôve finally accepted my reality, and that it can‚Äôt be changed. I think I no longer have any tears left. I feel dry inside.

1jvibx8,i rlly want some advice ;(,"I'll try to make this quick so I wouldn't be boring anyone who's reading this, but I need help.

WHAT I WANT ADVICE WITH: I know there's a lot of ideas (i.e. joining a club, volunteering) to MAKE new friends, but I really want to learn how to get used to talking and texting people more again without having to actually befriend someone for the sole purpose of having more friends (because that seems manipulative and super cruel)

Situation: In five months I will be starting a new school (in a different country and living with a different family <-- BY CHOICE) and I want real friends again, but I don't think that I still know how to make friends and I am becoming increasingly more prone to self-isolation (I'm now better than I was a few months ago and I still want to go to the new school, but I no longer feel that I'd be able to enjoy it as much as I'd want to ;(

About me: I am naturally a really extroverted person and it used to be really easy to find and make friends with legit anybody and everybody. However, after spending time in a friendgroup (that I got kicked out of BECAUSE two of the people in the friendgroup had an argument with two of my other friends outside of the friendgroup...storytime=for another time) for under a year, the sheer awkwardness of the group when I was in it (like how it felt when talking to them, or even watching how they interacted with each other (which was the same with when they interacted with me) was honestly super awkwardd (E.G. real awkward silences n everything)) and I sincerely believe that that may be one of the more significant things that had led to my incapabilities in reverting back to my outgoing nature (in addition to my response to the rumors that were directly about me as well, which were all false). Now since we have to prepare for our GCSE's, my (new) friends (in my current friendgroup) and I are studying/revising independently so we don't go out as much as I'd like....at all, so I honestly don't feel like this is good practice for the next school at all >:( ...But they're lovely so it's okayy :)
