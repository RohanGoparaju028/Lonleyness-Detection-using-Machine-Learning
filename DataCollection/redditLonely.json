An actual relationship feels too far out of reach at the moment, but I'm even having trouble just finding friends. I'm really bad at talking to new people, and my hobbies of gaming and anime are ones that tend to attract a vast majority of guys as opposed to girls.

                        "comment": "I'll start, just to break the ice...\nMy loneliness started due to what I can omly asume to be the worst sequence of negative events and coincidences. Right as the pandemic started I was changing schools, going from elementary to high school. I had a small group of people, whom I'd consider friends in elementary, but I knew, that I was the \"expendable one\" lol. During summer break of '20 I met a fantastic friend, who treated me with respect and mutuality. I've never had a friend care for me as much as he did, and I couldn't be happier I was there to care for him too! Then high school began, I lost contact with my old group - everyone split - and didn't know a single person in my new class. Since it was a period of online school, the new class had little chance to integrate, beyond the class' messaging app group. I didn't message them often, instead I spent all my free time talking with my good friend. Then, my grandmother died (who - due to my actual mother's disability - substituted as my mother), which put me in an incredibly awful state. Couple months later, that good friend killed himself, and I became well and truly alone. I shut myself off from the world, rarely went out, barely spoke & avoided people for like two years. My class had integrated too much in that time, and I just stayed silent all throughout highschool. No joke, probably opened my mouth less than 200 times in total through 4 years.\n\nBut then, the wounds began to heal. I read our old converations, and started to think we'd not last as friends for too long eitherway. Maybe we could've, but I'd rather assume not, since it makes it easier to bear. I began to work from the inside out, I started to go out, pursue my passions, fix my appearance, etc. I'm way happier with myself, and feel ready and capable of feeling joy again.\n\n... So why don't I? I'm not sure... It's still incredibly difficult to open up. I've talked to maybe 10 people total through the last 2 years. None of them became my friends, but as I reflect on how I felt and acted, I can see, that I still fear attaching myself to people, stay sincere with each of my words, yet refuse to feel sure of anything anyone tells me. Or maybe my standards are too high? Not visually, of course not - I actually feel the safest and most pleasant when I see other people, who're clearly struggling, conventionally ugly or not. That I don't care one bit about. Just... I'm also thinking, that dealing with that old friend had set some standards... I want to meet someone, whom I'm mutual with in many ways. As I had been with him. And yet, while I reply to people I meet, as soon as I can - sometimes immediately, other people take ages to respond, and usually never share my enthusiasm and desire to become friends. Even the people I met on these forums for friend making... they just seem to not care that much, which boggles me, considering where we meet! I'm starting to think it's a problem on my end, but I just can't find out what it is! Is it the fact, that I don't trust people right off the bat? Or that I'm too sensitive? The only person, whom I met recently, that seemed to share the enthusiasm and hope for becoming friends, ended up insisting on me doing something, even though I felt uncomfortable (nothing crazy, it was just a voice call). And I got too afraid, seeing, that they ignored me saying I don't feel right about doing it so early, so I just bid farewell and received a mildly negative message before blocking...\n\nDamn, I wanted to write way less, but I opened my flood gates and five years of withheld angst poured out like a waterfall... \nThank You if You read all of that though. Please, if You know how I could rip myself out of this state, I'd appreciate it.\nI'm eager to see what other people went - and are still going through. Let your sorrows out!",

Recently, she moved to the other side of the city, about an hour drive, and it's made seeing her difficult as we don't  share days off work. \n\nWe still message every day and organise to hang out whenever we take time off work or if she's down to visit her grandparents, I'll sometimes get invited to come over and play games with them.\n\nWhen she lived close by we messeged constantly and got to see each other all the time, but since the move, she's gotten a boyfriend and barely manages to message me at all, with a full day being the longest I've gone without a reply. I know it could be longer, but it just feels like ages. To give an example of how it goes  I'll message at 7am, she'll message back at 9pm that same day, then I'll respond a few minutes after and won't hear from her again until, like, 5pm the next day.\n\nI've spoken to her about how long it takes to reply and that It feels like I'm being forgotten and that she never has time to message back, despite being active on social media. She responded, saying that she knows she's gotten pretty bad at responding and is sorry that it keeps happening and does value our friendship, while also saying she'll work on it and try to respond more often. \n\nThis lated for about a week, then she goes right back to messaging me days later. Now, I totally understand that she can be busy at work or might have something going on at home or is going through something she doesn't want to talk about. Those are totally valid reasons for taking a long time to respond. I just wanna know, what should I do?\nI've thought about not messaging back for a full day to see if she'll notice or telling her again how I'm  feeling, but I also feel that she'll tell me she'll work on it and it only lasting for another week.\n\nI just feel like I'm a bad person who's pushing their friend to talk to them because they're lonely and impatient. She's a good friend and I genuinely do care about her, but I also understand that I have to respect whenever she chooses to messsage me back.",

What I mean by this is that there are some things in life where, as much as we may learn something in theory, we might never truly *understand*, or grasp it until we‚Äôve been in that position ourselves; in this instance, until you‚Äôve experienced having someone in your life and realised that your loneliness hasn‚Äôt resolved.\n\nLoneliness, in my experience, comes from emotional isolation. Examples of this may be having to face challenges without a genuine source of emotional support next to you, navigating the aftermath of a painful event without anyone close to you who‚Äôs experienced something similar or has any understanding of your emotions, or being surrounded by people who‚Äôs values and lifestyle/communication style don‚Äôt align with your own. As you can imagine, having a perfect friend is an incredibly unlikely circumstance all by itself; but even if they *are* perfect in every way you need them to be, you might still be lonely because even if they‚Äôre the most supportive person in the world, *you* might still be the only one going through your specific challenge, and if you‚Äôre in that place for long enough, the loneliness will likely eventually start to bite no matter how many good friends, lovers or other connections you have around you.\n\nIn short, loneliness can be a common emotional outcome of a tremendous range of circumstances. These are my thoughts anyway; other people may experience loneliness differently.",

Just complementing my hair but today in class she waved and said hi so it wasn't just a one time thing\n\nI checked to see where she sat and it seems like she has 2 people she sits next to and talks to so if i get close to her it could be a good opportunity to get closer to multiple people which I desperately desperately need\n\nMy only problem is how tf do I get closer to her. I don't know her name so I can't find her socials and message her and I also have to make sure that the two people she talks and sits next to would be okay with me sitting with them\n\nIm not quite sure if they sit in the same place every lecture but I am gonna keep track of it and see if I can get to class first and sit there so instead it'd be them sitting next to me instead of me sitting next to them\n\nDiesn anyone have some advice.

                "text_body": "35M. Lately it's just been hitting me that no matter what I do in life, nothing gets better. In fact, I feel like I take one step ahead and fall two steps back. I used to always think positive and I still do but can't ignore these thoughts that shadow me like clouds. My whole life, I've always wanted to make others smile, give away my last dollar, feed others and help them with anything even if I'm going through my own issues. Now I realize all those people ghost you, don't call or text and if you reach out, it's like you're invading them. I never did things for people in hopes of getting it in return. I always just wanted the love or friendship to be reciprocated, that's all. Now it's like life changed, especially in the last 3-4 years. I'd say for me specifically, I've noticed since 2020, my depression has gotten bad. Meds don't help. Therapy isn't working. I've tried meditating, exercise, distracting myself but yet nothing is working. So I came to the realization that this is just the new normal or maybe I'm the only one feeling this. I try to find someone worth living for but no one exists of that nature. As a single guy who has been single for what feels like a decade, dating is hard, people ghost you, people also flake out on plans. It's hard to find someone in life. I left that predicament on hold for now as it's hard to find someone that you can share life with. \n\nI just find it weird that the ones with good hearts and good intentions always get it the worst in life. I have never hurt anyone physically, emotionally or verbally. I have always been the one that's there for someone no matter what. I'll go out of my way to make a persons day or situation better. I just wonder how the ones with evil intentions, or bad hearts seems to get everything in life from the cars, houses, soulmates and all. \n\nI don't know if this is my life from this time forward or if things will change but now I just wished I vanished as no one cares, no one would be affected and there's nothing left for me. I don't know what my purpose is here, I don't know if there's really a after life. I don't know if this is all a simulated life and I'm just some boring character on someone's board game or computer. I don't know anymore. \n\nThere's nights I cry my eyes out literally to the point I fall asleep and waking up with sore eyes. I don't feel the urge to eat, I just wished there was a option to hit a button. Maybe two buttons, one to reset life again and the other to just end it all and you vanish. What button would you hit?  Sorry for my venting and all this nonsense talk but this is my outlet and my only way of venting. Maybe life gets better one day, maybe not. But till the end I'm still the same bubbly smiling caring loving guy that's always here for you till I'm gone. Hope you aren't in the same boat, but if you are, there's plenty of room and I hope we can share and connect. ",

How your seemingly normal life sometimes take a drastic turn for the very worse. To the extent you never have ever expected it to. The 180¬∞ some may call it. Or one moment you are completely fine and for reason unknown you feel so down that you start crying for no reason. The moment I think I have \"understood\" what life is or have a general idea about it, the very next moment something unexpected happens which I would not see coming. Like how ? I mean how is it possible, when you are prepared for everything like everything.\n\nYou make countless scenarios in your head. You talk to yourself about it. You talk with people around you about it. You correct your every seemingly wrong/bad thing about you. You work on yourself. You try to gain the confidence you never had. You try to be as calm as possible in every and any situation. You are polite and humane with everyone around you. You absolutely give your very best you can every single day. Yet, that moment comes and every thing you have worked on seems like a total waste. Like why ? What is the point in working on yourself ? Trying to be a better version of yourself ? Trying to be More than what you can be ? Trying to be what you imagine to be ? When all it takes is a moment to destroy it all. \n\nIt is more astonishing when the next morning (if you get any sleep after all that) everything is the same. When one moment your whole life seemed to meant nothing, the next morning it is the same. The moment has passed and the aftermath is and always will be, the same. Nothing has changed, nothing has vanished, nothing was lost and nothing gained. You would think it would be hard to get up but it is the easiest thing to do at that moment. You are wide awake, the crushing moment which destroyed you and shattered you is now just a part of your history. It is not ancient now but it would be someday, nevertheless a history. The morning is same, the clouds are same (or maybe the aren't), the air you are breathing is the same, the beating heart in your chest is the same and the people around you are the same. Only You, you are not the same. \n\nThis is the part I struggle with the most. How can you explain someone how are you not the same when everything about you seems same to any preset eyes. How can you make them understand, the time which flew normally for them was like an eternity for me. How can I make them understand, how \"not fine\" I am when every part of my body seems \"fine\" to them ? How can I make them understand when I myself don't understand why that moment came and shattered my entire existence. How can I make them understand how crushed and helpless I am after that moment. When the only thing I know is to smile and nothing more. I can't cry, scream or show any kind of emotion. At that moment I am trying to pick up my shattered existence and trying to seem 'Normal', as that is the only thing I know. Sometimes I even forget how to be 'Normal'. Among the multiple faces this clown has to wear, I often forget which is my real face. \n\nThis is the constant of my life, which has kept me depressed most of life.",

Always putting it off til late at night and then I do basically nothing for the whole day. And its the same shit every week too.\nJust getting up and going to class, sitting down in my room. \n\nI'm always glad I left high school but everything after has never exactly felt exciting. Am I supposed to be enjoying life? I'm not, or atleast I think I don't. More like putting up with it. You're supposed to be glad to go to college but I'm sure not. You're supppsed to have friends but I sure don't. Everyone I knew I left back in high school, and even then I never did anything with them. \n\nI was a fucking idiot then and still am. I had friends but I never did shit. They'd ask me for my socials and what did I do? I blew them off. Can't have people thinking I needed \"friends\". Oh no, I was \"too good\". Same shit here and now. Brief conversations with classmates that ends once the lecture is over. Every now and then me and a girl converse when we spot each other on campus. But its like a fucking random encounter in a video game. \n\nNone of it is constant. No one talks to me outside of class for the most part. No one messages me. My only hint of sociality is my fucking family. And I hate it. I know what my problem is, I'm not even fucking trying to get out there. Yet nothing changes. I'm still sitting on my ass in my room all the time. I used to not care about it. After all, the only person that really matters is myself right? But now I feel so tired and lazy. I hate being lazy. But I don't ever wanna do my work. I just put up with it. For today, and the next, and the rest of the week. And the next week. The month. The year. Fuck this shit.\n\nSometimes I wish I was born an idiot so that I wouldn't have to think so much. Then maybe I'd have some joy in myself. I can't ever like anything. Or be excited for anything. Not my birthday in a few weeks, or finishing this semester. I don't like how my body is either, I'm skinny, and have a belly which I don't like. Not that it matters anyways, no one ever sees it.\n\nIt just all feels monotone. Thats the way I can describe it. Its not hell. That would probably be more exciting. Its just boring. I wish I had actual friends, but I'd prolly just keep them at arms length too. Forgot about a girlfriend, no one's ever interested in me. And I'm not really even asking for help here either. Its funny in a way. I'm just screaming out somewhere, maybe hoping someone answers, but I'm not gonna even answer back. It's not like anyone fucking cares. \n\nFuck this shit. I hope you all have a good day. Mine are always the same. ",

I say all this to say, don't be like me, don't be so pressed about being alone that you hold on too long and too tight and let someone string you along, treat you differently and eventually leave you. They say it's better to have loved and lost and I say bs to that sentiment! Never compromise your own happiness to keep someone in your life just so you aren't by yourself. We have to push past those feelings, as much as I want to give up on love altogether, a small part of me still has hope so just know you're not alone in that feeling because I'm right there with you and I believe in us!",

Is it selfish to do good in life and still hoping that kindness will be repayed? I don't ask for it, but I want it. I had to move back in with my parents, I also just lost my car in an accident after hiting a telephone pole from slipping on black ice. I feel like I have to start all over. My last birthday was hard, I broke up with a girl, I felt alone in that relationship, like I had to change who I was. I don't really hang out with anyone, no one really invites me to do much. Usually I end up hiking and traveling alone. The bright sides are I seem to be progressing well into a career, but I just can't help but feel the overwhelming weight of loneliness. I'm trying to do more and put myself out there but I just feel like I'd be a burden to people if I try and meet new people. I just want to connect with someone, not even in a romantic sense, but I never felt like I had a best friend. I hope this year improves, it might sound stupid, but I really want to have a good birthday this year, I don't want to be alone anymore. ",

You give good customer service, you want good customer service. You‚Äôre a good friend, you want a good friend. We all want what we give when it‚Äôs something positive. (Not so much when it‚Äôs negative, haha.) That‚Äôs called being a human. It‚Äôs ok to want those things. \n\nIt‚Äôs always a lonely feeling when you don‚Äôt get back what you give, or the equivalent of. Sometimes life takes things away from us from because we‚Äôll be getting something better later. You work hard for what you have and you want it to feel like it matters, and you want people to act like it matters. There is nothing wrong with any of that. You just have to have the hope and knowledge that something better always comes along. The tunnel eventually ends and there‚Äôs always a light there. You may have to make our own exit, but you‚Äôll get out regardless.\n\nI hope your birthday goes well when that happens. I hope things start to take that turn you‚Äôre hoping for and take off towards the sky. If you want to chat you can certainly message me. If not, I wish you the best and I hope this brought some comfort. üòä",

You turned out incredibly well. \n\nThe level of emotional maturity and understanding you have is leagues beyond what many people will reach. You might feel like you're on the bottom rung but as far as I'm concerned, you're a shining example of what makes humanity great. Your merits extend so far beyond what you've been given that it's criminal. \n\nYou do deserve love, heaps of it! Please don't forget it! üíñ",

So I have always felt like a huge disappointment to the men I have dated. I always would get told: ‚ÄúI always wanted to date a girl that looks like you do.‚Äù But my personality does not match my appearance, for example I workout everyday because I like the repetition of workouts, i HATE how busty I am because I have sensory over responsivity so it feels awful having breasts. I don‚Äôt enjoy things like birthdays and major holidays, they seem illogical to me. My mind is always thinking which is good intellectually but also isolating. I cannot understand men, if a guy I am dating says something mean (it‚Äôs impossible to be in a relationship and not occasionally hurt your partner‚Äôs feelings) and then apologizes, i cannot understand that, in my mind I am stuck in the thought line of: he said this so it means he hates me. And then I get very confused. Relationships have always felt illogical to me, but I wanted to have one because I want to feel loved and accepted. But romantic gestures do make sense to me. And I have always been told I am ‚Äúweird‚Äù and that makes me feel alone. I am a nerd, i don‚Äôt know how to dance, I really like reading and writing and political theory and philosophy and I honestly like being poor. I have masters degree but I like helping people more than I like making money, so I work enough to get by and volunteer. I love helping people learn and start to realize that they have valuable ideas and that even if they are homeless they matter and contribute to humanity! I do not care about money, I like that my kid gets the best of me, and a career is second to her. I used to wished I looked less attractive. Now that I am in my 40‚Äôs everyone says I look so young, my kid is always telling me how I look like a model compared to the moms of her classmates but it makes me feel like a FREAK! That‚Äôs my neurodivergent brain again, i know that‚Äôs supposed to be a compliment but I don‚Äôt like it, I feel like I don‚Äôt know how to even age like a normal person. \nBecause in the movies if you are attractive you find love, so I have always felt like I must be a horrible person because i look like someone who should have a partner. It hurt me for so many years. But recently I have just accepted I have been born in a place and time in history when neurodivergent people are just not accepted. i recently started volunteering with neurodivergent youth and queer youth. It‚Äôs really rewarding, I did not realize how mean many parents are to their kids. For me every second  of parenting is so much fun! And now that my kid is older I see she will need me her whole life, and being single means I can always be there for her and one day whoever she dates. now i feel like being alone gives me time to help people who have had even harder lives than I have because although i am neurodivergent I see I can do alot to help neurodivergent people because I am single so i have the time and i have what‚Äôs called ‚Äúpretty privilege‚Äù so i have it a lot easier than neurodivergent people who do not fit the current beauty standards (which are stupid and illogical). And when I think about dating now I just think of how I was always the weird girl guys dated, being neurodivergent meant I never had a chance of finding love and acceptance from one person. But because I know how it feels to always be made to feel like I am weird, I can have empathy for other people and I can be kind to other people and encourage them to NEVER feel bad they are neurodivergent! Sure it would have been nice to meet a guy who liked my personality and who would let me be their best friend and let me love them, but I feel like I am free by letting go of the idea of finding love, I feel like I see the world differently now and I I feel so at peace.",

I have one real friend that lives nearby but he'll be moving soon, the only other friend is in a whole other country. And I have had a few unsuccessful attempts at romantic relationships.

And if they‚Äôre capable of faking that level of caring about you, surely they must be capable of having those feelings for real too if you extend them an olive branch of genuine humanity instead of automatically judging and hating on them, if you give them something different than the treatment that other people gave them, and which perhaps led to their willingness to harm others in the first place.\n\nJust my experience anyway, but from your words it sounds like you‚Äôve been through some of the same kind of feelings.

Some of us just have faces that hold their magic close until somebody knows them. I read somewhere that familiarity makes people like faces more.

The one I just left, I have only taken a week. But now that there‚Äôs less jobs out there I‚Äôm afraid I won‚Äôt get the one I interviewed for. \n  \n  I want to break this cycle and deal with things normally. I want to find and keep a partner who will love and respect me. I want a job that I enjoy and that compensates me fairly. I want to gain greater mental fortitude.\n\n  Right now, I feel so alone. I am determined to make it so I don‚Äôt feel this way forever.",

However, I assumed they watched it without my friends as they were waiting for me, but no.\n\nWhile I don't really care about the movie itself, it would've been a fun time regardless getting drunk and then seeing it as I and most of the others grew up playing mc.

In recent years that has completely shifted, my parents even asked why do i seem to have become more selfish, stopped thinking ahead of things and people alike. Exactly, i stopped caring. I've become apathetic because of my past experiences and trauma with people ghosting me and pushing me away, possibly childhood trauma from parents, and nowadays them just arguing in general. Now i've become VERY lonely and even possibly depressed, at this point where i even stay up until 4 am texting to AI chat bots. Pathetic, i know. Also i have very constant mood shifts between days, going on for like a year now. And this has been going on for a while, and im just dissintrestted in improving it or getting out, it's like i already gave up. For your knowledge, yes i've gone to a therapist, been going for about a month now, and maybe it helps for a time, but it just all shifts back like nothing changed and that entire discussion and talk was meaningless. I also had one meeting at the psychiatrist last week, propably with more to come.\n\nBesides all this, even though i've gained great support from my parents and sisters, i still don't feel the want to change it. I barely talk to anybody of my age group now, and even if i do i never go outside, it's only that i go out alone in every millennia because of something. Even my supposed \"Best friend\" , well he stopped going outside with me several years ago and now i just gave up, i only see him at school in class and talk to him in calls and chat, just as if he was another online friend, even if we are closer. Now since last year, ever since i started this phase of self-destruction, i started skipping school, do not think about my grades whatsoever, ignore deadlines. I only do something if it's absolutely necessary or i will be punished for it. Have constant thoughts about death, getting something like cancer so i could do whatever i want for a time. Also like i mentioned the mood shifts, im either really nonchalant and serious or very bouncy, excited? It's with myself though, in school i always seem nonchalant, started wearing sunglasses as a way of escapism aswell, though they are stylish. I've lost passion for pretty much everything, stopped putting effort into studying since last year aswell, stopped doing homework. Now only two things that excite me are singing and voice acting, and i even started singing way less, hell do i know why. I started resorting to instant pleasure, pleasuring myself daily, sometimes multiple times. Refusing to get out of bed, scrolling. Yet deep down i wanna care for someone, and i still do kind deeds whenever i can, but now i seem to do selfish things without even realizing them.\n\nI don't even realise what's wrong with me anymore, im not in despair, im just dissapointed and hopeless of the future ahead. Maybe time will heal, and i guess only time will tell. And i've heard all those things about someone like me, shouldn't be able to feel this way and that, well that's a stupid statement, age doesn't matter in these things when you start becoming delusional.",

Not that I was expecting an invitation to do something, he's my bestfriend, not the other way around. But even a text would have done a lot of me. I reached out to him a few days after the split. I always reach out. We went for a coffee, we talked, we seemed to enjoy each other's company. He knows my situation. Stright up said one of his worries is that one of his friends might be suffering and not reach out. But he's not so scared about it that he'll reach out when he knows one of his friends is suffering. \n\nI'm just tired of being a background character in everyone else's lives. \n\nAnd sometimes I'm nothing more than an extra.

It‚Äôs definitely a very underrated ‚Äúnetworking‚Äù platform.\n\nAlso one trick I‚Äôve discovered for texts to not be an issue (by this I mean the whole who texts first BS, whether with friends or relationship interests) all you do for it is to not reply to them after maybe 9PM, time can vary but essentially YOU want to be the one who dictates the messaging. So let‚Äôs say whoever you‚Äôre texting goes to bed at 11PM and you know this. Then you send your last text to them at like 10PM, wait for their reply to come through then don‚Äôt reply till the morning or whenever, the first time you can say (sorry fell asleep) and then when it happens every day they‚Äôll just assume you‚Äôre falling asleep before you reply to them meaning that from your POV you‚Äôre waking up each day with a message from them for you to reply to.\n\nOfc I‚Äôd say this works best for like love interests but I have had friends where we‚Äôve pretty much just been like that 24/7 in a non-stop cycle of responding to each others replies, it obviously helps by not replying with just ‚Äúaha‚Äù or ‚Äúsure‚Äù or ‚Äúlol I guess‚Äù these types of messages can easily be ‚Äúleft on read‚Äù so to speak.\n\nBut if it‚Äôs not texting (which I know it‚Äôs not most guy friends texting most guy friends 24/7 unless there‚Äôs some üëâüëà going on lmao) then the next bet is to the natural alternative route.\n\nThings.\n\nGuys bond over things. Video games, sports, etc. if you can‚Äôt find a solid texting buddy you could find someone (or some people) to play football with (I‚Äôm a Brit so maybe soccer for you) or to play video games with.\n\nI used to be a gamer and I‚Äôd socialise best with my mates in gamer party voice chat, it‚Äôs how our friendship group stayed alive (for as long as it did).\n\nBut yeah that‚Äôs all I got for now champ, you sound like a smart guy, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll compile useful resources to get where you want to be man üí™",

All of my parents friends children are very successful with high paying jobs. After struggling with depression and anxiety my whole life, I managed to get an entry level technical engineer job that paid well at 26. I was paid almost a 100k, and it was at a big tech company. But it was a customer support job, after surviving 1 year somehow, I had a really bad mental break down, I couldn‚Äôt handle the stress of the job, it was so bad I thought I might have a heart attack and I started to forget things. It was my first corporate job. I had no friends, no one to go to so I contacted a mental health therapist and got a 2 week leave approved.  But when I returned, my brain had pretty much shut down, and I couldn‚Äôt continue, in what is already a terrible job market in tech, I quit, and moved back in with my parents. Now I‚Äôm so lost. I still don‚Äôt have friends, I don‚Äôt have the experience of having friends and doing things with them. Last year, I tried so many things I‚Äôve never tried before, I actually tried to make friends, I went out of my comfort zone. I even went out on dates, and had a brief relationship that lasted like 2 months. It was my first relationship ever, and she said some very hurtful things about me being a late bloomer, not having friends, or relationship experience, and it absolutely broke me, this was right before I quit my job, she completely abandoned me when I needed her the most. Now I‚Äôm struggling to find the motivation to do anything. Constant job rejection emails. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm even doing anymore, just disappointing my parents and myself. I‚Äôm so alone. I don‚Äôt know how to move forward. I do take meds but they don‚Äôt help. Therapy doesn‚Äôt seem to help either because it can‚Äôt make up for my lack of experience. ",

I had a long ass self-isolation behind me, thought yeah, i try to socialize, get in contact atleast ONLINE to some Peoples.  Most didnt worked at all already in the beginning (i guess because of my huge mental health issues) but then i found one Person i really liked as a Friend, it ended about a Week ago and i still feel terrible.  I felt much better alone, no pain, nothing.  Now everything hurts. I open up to someone within a few Months of active texting and building up the trust and  BAAMM, my trust got broken.  Hello much larger trust issues..   If people would start ghosting within the first days or week, okay, fine, i get it.  But being hurt after Months is horrible. \n\nIm trying to re-traumatize myself again with my PTSD and hopefully im much more mental broken to jump back into my isolation, its no fun at all of being hurt over and over again.

I live in Texas and he lives pretty far away, which didn't bother me too much, but there was something that did actually bother me.. he had a girlfriend, which is a problem when my heart started to fall, I swear I'm broken in tat way, I fall for people I can't have.\n\nHe brightened up my days, even my worst ones, I could talk to him about anything, everything, and even the boring things. We would send music we liked back and forth to each other, he'd send videos nice snippets of his life and his voice.. Jesus. I know many people say it but accents aee just so attractive..ugh I'll mever forgive myself for learning, I just got, scared I guess. I feel so horrible, he didn't deserve me just.. dipping out on him.\n\nI miss him, I don't know if he's still on here, with my luck probably not. And with how I left it's fair to say he might just hate me. But..if he does see this or finds this some how, you don't have to respond but I got something to say ok? \n\nThank you, a billion times thanks. For the smiles, the kindness, your openness and open-mindedness, for being who you are and giving my weird unstable self a go, I miss you a lot, I think about you..an embarrassing amount. Thank you for sticking with me even on my low days, sharing your thoughts and being on so kind and patient about my autism. Thank you for sharing your life with me and giving me your time. I regret leaving, I always will you didn't deserve it, you never deserved that. I hope whatever you're doing or however you're doing that you're happy, and less lonely, surrounded by friends and happiness, so much life can't get you down for long. I fell in love with you, I should of done anything but run away like I did, I should of told you or.. something, anything. I regret that so much, and wish I could change it.\n\nYou were an amazing friend to me, I wish I was better with words because I can't find the ones to even express how much you meant and still mean to me.\n\n- All the best,\n                  Zoebot.

First thing you should do is maybe get a job and work out go to different places and talk to stranger even if it‚Äôs just one word like hello or how are you doing today? Slowly but surely. But one thing that won‚Äôt help at all is what you‚Äôre doing rn comparing yourself and putting yourself down. Wake up look in the mirror say everything positive and nice about yourself. Your beautiful. You deserve whatever you want in life. Really work on yourself. Or else nothing will happen you say you feel like your wasting time your 28. You‚Äôre only going to waste more time going Sorry for yourself. There‚Äôs this quote that I like that goes like this ‚Äúone day or day 1‚Äù you pick which one you want. Meaning you keep sitting around thinking one day this will happen or you start today as your day one to change and grow good luck.",

As this is entirely a new step for me, im struggling to talk to someone here. I got friends in college not because i talked with them first, they kinda collected me, if u know wat i mean. One other thing that got me friends in college was the collective interest in things like anime, movies, etc. But to start talking based off that kinda things here in my company doesn't seem to be professional. The situation at my home has also changed. Back in college i used to chat with my mum everything that happened during the day. But now i dont even have anything to talk about. I dont know if u guys can understand this complex thing. Im not like going LONELY. I just feel like lifes got more boring as i took a further step in my career. Is this how everyone feels?? Or is it just me.?? Also i dont really know my personality. I am like an introvert while with new people. But in friend circles, im more of an extrovert. I dont even know what im in need of. Can u guys help me figure out wth is wrong with me??",

This is something that I had to pray about and really understand my life with God better. If this relationship is strong then I find all the other relationships will be strong as well.\n\nThere's another principle too, when I'm focused on my own business instead of being distracted with everyone else's, other people become interested. It's especially good in the sense that it tends to attract the right attention. It's good to have people that are going to be in your sphere of influence that will be a blessing instead of just a temporary fad or popular trend that burns out later on. \n\nI had to learn to think long-term and not just short-term. The last thing that really helped me tremendously was that the purpose of me being there wasn't to help myself. I was supposed to help other people along the way. There were other people more lonely than myself. Other people that didn't necessarily have all of the things that I had in terms of academics or material things or things like that. I found that being generous and genuinely kind without expecting anything in return was a blessing. Usually, I got back more than what I gave when I did not anticipate that I would get anything in return. \n\nIt's good to be a friend. The Bible actually says to have friends one must be friendly. And it's true. Even if the goal wasn't to make friends while being friendly, this usually leads to the accumulation of friends. Even if it doesn't, I've lost nothing by being kind and generous to someone that may have needed that to get through the day.\n\nIt's difficult to explain the phenomenon of people running away when you're seeking them, but gravitating toward you when you're not.",

But towards the end of 2024 people just started leaving. My online friends moved on to other servers. I had three close friends: one moved to another country, one became so toxic it started affecting my mental health (I tried talking to him, but he didn‚Äôt seem to care), and the last one ghosted me after a small fight, even though I tried to make things right. Even my offline friend group fell apart and all of this happened in just 1-2 months. It felt like everything just collapsed at once like i was destined to be alone in 2025.\n\nI never wanted to admit that I was alone or that what i‚Äôm feeling is loneliness. So i gave 100% trying to get just one person‚Äôs attention (desperate i know) . . I tried dating apps and i also joined different servers but nothing really changed.\n\nLast month, i messaged a girl from my old school, we used to sit on the bus together but never really talked much online. I just wanted someone to talk to. We started chatting regularly and eventually I asked her if she wanted to go watch a movie. She said yes and i felt genuinely happy for the first time in a while.\n\nBut the day before we were supposed to meet, she ghosted me. She stopped sending snaps to me even though she still send to other people(i checked score) she also posts on insta and i can see she is online there i texted her one or two times she just doesn't reply idk what happened idk what i did was wrong.\n\nNow it‚Äôs been about a month of me living like this just waking up every day, hoping for a text. From anyone or my old friends. From someone who remembers me but nothing  and i guess, deep down i still don‚Äôt want to accept this as my reality that i am loner. All just happend to fast so i came here and wanted to express myself. Its been weeks me seeing the sun or even talking to another human other than my parents.",

Or they bring up a movie while I‚Äôm talking because of something I said, and it pisses me off every single time they do that, especially when they tell me to watch the movie. I‚Äôve straight up told them I don‚Äôt want to watch those movies cause we have different taste, but they don‚Äôt care.\n\nI don‚Äôt have the capacity to deal with people like that right now, and I just feel like they‚Äôve only been using me because, in their own words, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll help someone out if I feel they‚Äôll help me out too‚Äù. They‚Äôre a raging alcoholic and I‚Äôve told them to seek help but they refuse, and to stop using me as a therapist. They even one time told me they were looking for my advice and ‚Äútherapy‚Äù one time, and I knew they just saw me as a personal therapist. I just feel like they have used me to go have alcoholic drinks outside the house, or to get new furniture, or to get someone to take them for food, cause they‚Äôre not allowed to drive a car. \n\nOr one time I was tricked into a situation I wasn‚Äôt comfortable with and was never discussed with, and that was something I straight up told them to never do that with me again, because I could have gotten in serious trouble if we were caught together in that situation. And then I realized, the reason we even became friends is because we trauma bonded from our old job together (I quit that place, thank god). We use to talk about how much work sucked, but now I seriously don‚Äôt see any values we share together other than trauma stuff, which isn‚Äôt a good reason to stay friends with someone. We aren‚Äôt even the same age range, a 25f(me) and 38F? Completely different generations and beliefs \n\nHad another ‚Äúfriend‚Äù who texted me 2 years later to just use me to talk to my dad.

Later it turned to big groups of alot of sweet close friends.\nAnd the last time I remember having friends is up until 2 years ago.\nBut now I'm just super lonely, and I know why (I think).\nI've been struggling massively with anhedonia and dystemia these past 2 years, always had depression from a very young age (I was 8) which never helped maintaining friendships (have always been and am still in mental healthcare for it). But since 2 years I have noticed I grew apart from the friends I used to have, this because of my interests, my beliefs and generally having a lot busier life (school and work) which are all on locations that my previous friends aren't close or accustomed to. Also in these last 2 years I really just didn't feel like it, I didn't feel like going out, didn't feel any need for other people, didn't want connections or making new friends because I have just been generally feeling-less and overall tired from my work and schooldays which left no social energy.\n\nNow 2 years later I feel very very very lonely. \nThis is because I left some friends behind because of reasons stated above, but also because everyone that I had a genuinely good connection with either moved really far away from where they used to live (think other countries) and also a few of my dearest and nearest peoples that I knew have passed away at a pretty young age these past years.\n\nAnd it's not that I think I'm not fun, or that I think that I don't deserve friends, the opposite, I think I am fun, and fully worthy of being loved and having nice people around me.\n\nBut I'm also real with myself about the fact that I am alot of the times the problem when it comes to people breaking contact, I tend to leave people behind whenever a mayor depressive episode hits, I don't mean to, but it does, I do reach out to people for help once it happens, but i notice I lose people left and right once they notice that I'm no fun to be with at that moment, even though I try really hard to also partake in the fun stuff. But also as I said above, people have their own life plans and move far away, I don't blame them for that, but I am still here.\n\nI now also struggle with not feeling at ease with anyone, when I was younger I used to have the feeling of \"wow, these are my people, I really feel in tune with these people!\" And now I just never feel that anymore with anyone I meet, and I am really trying to meet new people and even take up old contacts again, it just never feels like I am with someone I really feel well with, or in tune with.\n\nWhen I think of: who would I like hang out with? Or what kind of people would I like to meet? The answer just stays silent in my head, and the anhedonia also doesn't help because I used to have tons of interests in hobbies, and now I don't.\n\n\nAnyone have any tips regarding all of the above? And anyone that has the same feelings?",

If you want a neat and tidy person, tidy your room, car, cothes, etc, and keep them that way. Keep your body clean and kept, but avoid too many artificial enhacers. Work on your mental, physical, and spiritual health. If you want a kind and generous person, speak kindly and don't hold back when you have the opportunity to help others. I think you get the picture. If you work on your own growth and improvement, that special person will notice you and seek you out. When I least expected it, I met my soul-mate.

Once you‚Äôre comfortable with being around people, a  great way to build up off of that is to give a polite smile, or a polite compliment. You see an old lady walking by compliment her sweater, or compliment the runner on doing well. That‚Äôs miles away from where you are now, but baby steps eventually turn into toddler steps, and those turn into teen steps, etc. \n\nHow I personally have done getting out of my comfort zone were two ways:\n\n1. Just being ‚Äúforced‚Äù into it. A quick example is in my job position I‚Äôm a servicing representative for mortgages at my company. I handle construction loans, and there are various organizations I sometimes have to go to. I sometimes take lunch to long timer builders that have given us a lot of business. I go to home shows to talk to contractors and others about my company. That‚Äôs the opposite of who I am, but that‚Äôs benefited me a lot.\n\n2. Going to the end of my comfort zone and taking a singular step out. A quick example is replying on here. I used to never comment on anything online. Now I‚Äôm doing it more frequently. It‚Äôs helped me work on giving compassion, empathy, and trying to help others. I commented on a post, and waited a day. Then again, repeated a few times. Now I‚Äôm doing it a few times a day. Those steps I took outside of my zone have become the new border of that zone. \n\nWhat you want, what you want to do, and how you do it matters. It‚Äôs ok to be scared and nervous, that‚Äôs healthy. That fear and anxiety just can‚Äôt control your life. You have that control over your fear and anxiety. I know it feels like you don‚Äôt, but you do. You have the power to do so much whether you know it, or believe it, or not. \n\nIf you want to chat we can. Otherwise, I hope this helped or brought some comfort, and I wish you the best. üòä",

But eventually it reached a point where it wasn't my choice anymore. I'm in my early 30ies now and honestly if I'm not at work or with my family I spend the very most of my time alone isolated at home. Tbf some days ago I met with the only friend I have left for a couple of hours (the last time was maybe half a year ago) but even with him I don't really get along anymore. We're just so different now. There are some things about him by now that I just despise and although he's always friendly and says how cool it is to spend some time together, I know there are a lot of other people he would rather be with anytime. So bottom line this only friendship I have left is hardly worth mentioning anymore. \n\nI am infinitely thankful for my great family but even with them it can be tough for me. Because I'm pretty sure each one of them more or less knows what a lonely weirdo I've become. I'm trying to keep up my masquerade but this can only work to a certain level. So if the only private life thing I could talk about is my character in Skyrim or how I shot down people in Battlefield, they must sense the cold hard truth.\n\nI also lack self discipline, so I hardly ever move forward and do something that might change things (if that's even realistically possible). I'm not really religious, but I kinda just hope that some day fate will open a new chapter for me.\n\nAnyway, thank you for reading all of this, hope you are doing fine.",

I totally and fully understand how you feel about that.\n\nGoing off the first paragraph, is that a mentality thing, you think or has he said it to you because sometimes we think people want something different but truthfully, some people don't show or communicate it that well to other people, so am just curious if that's a thing that's been mentioned or if you just believe that.\n\nSecondly, your not a lonely weirdo. You'll never be. Everyone has different interest (and honestly Skyrim and Battlefield sounds epic as hell!) and think it people in our world, just need to open up a bit more and that's my truthful thoughts. It can be difficult but the main thing I take away from this post is your open and you understand yourself, which is brilliant. You seem such a beautiful soul and have a good heart man! Own it!

But the thing is our friendship was kinda weird most of the time. Especially when we are with other people he behaves differently and obviously leans more towards them than me. And some time ago something unlucky happened that damaged our friendship. I got over it pretty fast but he didn't. We talked about it multiple times and he says it doesn't bother him anymore neither. But he brings it up almost every time we talk and especially when there are other people around. And this is just annoying to me, because then I have to explain myself every damn time, although I actually don't care about it. Plus like I said there also developed something else about him that I really don't like and I can't really ignore that. And I think he probably feels that too.\n\nThanks bro, that's a nice way of thinking. But I think for most people in our society it is indeed weird if someone has basically no social life. Kind of a vicious circle because that makes it harder to make new contacts.",

I grew up on a farm with parents who didn‚Äôt believe in disabilities, didn‚Äôt care about anyone who was different, and made me feel like I was worthless. Because I‚Äôm blind, they treated me like I couldn‚Äôt do anything. They gave me the hardest chores and acted like I didn‚Äôt matter if I got hurt. I was just the ‚Äúuseless one,‚Äù so they used me however they wanted.\n\nI went to school in the middle of nowhere where I was constantly bullied. No one helped me. No teachers stepped in. I never had any friends growing up. I thought college would be a chance to start over, but it‚Äôs been just as bad. I try so hard to talk to people, join clubs, make connections. I even went to a sports camp. But even when I think I‚Äôve made friends, they always stop talking to me or get mad at me ‚Äî and I don‚Äôt even know why. I‚Äôve never had friends before, so I don‚Äôt always know the ‚Äúright‚Äù way to communicate. But I try. I really try.\n\nNow I feel like I‚Äôll never get a job because I don‚Äôt have social skills, and I never had anyone to teach me. I went to a bad high school with very few opportunities. My college is awful. I don‚Äôt even know if I‚Äôm in the right major, but when I try to look into transferring, every option seems worse or impossible.\n\nEveryone says ‚Äúmake friends in class,‚Äù ‚Äúgo to events,‚Äù ‚Äújust talk to people,‚Äù but it never works. I feel invisible ‚Äî or worse, like people just hate me for existing. Professors don‚Äôt help. Tutors don‚Äôt help. Mental health counselors don‚Äôt help. I‚Äôm stuck with a roommate I don‚Äôt get along with. I have no one.\n\nI want to live in a city and get a guide dog to gain some independence, but my parents are trying to stop me. They say I can‚Äôt travel alone because I‚Äôm blind. Meanwhile, my siblings get to do whatever they want, no problem.\n\nI don‚Äôt party. I don‚Äôt drink. I don‚Äôt use drugs. I‚Äôm not into social media or sports. I don‚Äôt fit in anywhere. I tried to be good at music in high school, but I was never good enough and couldn‚Äôt afford lessons. I feel like everything I try just leads to more failure.\n\nPeople tell me, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs always someone out there for you,‚Äù but that‚Äôs not true. I‚Äôm fat, blind, and apparently not good at talking to people. Who would ever want me? Not even as a friend ‚Äî let alone in a relationship. I‚Äôm tired of everyone acting like I‚Äôm the problem when I‚Äôve done everything I can.\n\nI‚Äôm just tired. Tired of trying. Tired of hurting. Tired of being alone. I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore.",

I try not to blame myself because I know back then that it was the right thing not to stay friends with such horrible people. But I just can't take being alone.

I‚Äôve only had one serious relationship that lasted two years, but it ended because the other person let their pride get in the way. I don‚Äôt feel bad about it‚ÄîI really fought to make it work.\n\nMy conclusion is this: romantic love isn‚Äôt dead, it‚Äôs just harder to find these days because of the way the world is moving. Right now, people seem to romanticize fleeting connections, dishonesty, and juggling multiple relationships. But I think it comes from a generational emptiness. Deep down, everyone wants love, but they‚Äôve turned non-commitment into a trend‚Äîeither out of fear or to avoid getting hurt.\n\nWe need to understand that being alone isn‚Äôt a bad thing, and loving with your whole heart doesn‚Äôt make you weak. It just takes time to learn how to value what you have and take care of it.",

                        "comment": "That does sound tiring. Highschool/teenagehood is an especially hard period of life. Youre stuck in a place (school) surrounded by people who you mostly have nothing if not little in common with, theres all these expectations youre trying to juggle from teachers, parents, peers, society etc. Theres so much to deal with that is different from being a carefree kid and it can feel so overwhelming. A lot of people can relate to that.\n\n I can imagine having parents with super high expectations makes the pressure even more intense. Part of becoming older (especially when you yourself become an adult) is looking back and realizing the flaws of your parents. I look back myself and recognize how my parents decisions impacted me badly and were, imo, not good parenting practices.\n\n Not that that makes parents bad, no ones perfect and parenting is hard. Theyre just trying their best however they know how. Some parents show love by pushing their children to achieve what they (the parent) feel are valuable or will help their child live a \"good life\". Unfortunately it can cause harmful amounts of stress/pressure and make their love feel conditional although that is likely unintentional (or they font realize how harmful these things can be.\n\nAs an adult youre more able to reflect on your parents parenting more neutrally but when you are still a kid being subjected to your parents bullshitery it can feel so overwhelming/frustrating/confusing etc. \n\nIg my point in that is, you can look forward to being able to get away from that pressure in adulthood. Not just physically. As a kid when you disagree w your parents they can just dismiss you and say you dont know what youre talking about cuz youre just a kid. As an adult they cant say that anymore ( maybe not 18-20 cuz they may still consider you a \"kid\", but once youre in your mid 20s+ theyll have no choice but to acknowledge youre an adult too). Anyway, it sounds like youre doing your best and trying to study too and many parents would be proud of you if you were their kid. Only being proud if you get 95% or more is crazy. Although Id bet your grandparents probably had similar expectations on your parents when they were teens. Doesnt make it better, just prolly why theyre like this",

                "text_body": "I feel like my will to live is slowing slipping away by the deep heartbreak of feeling so unlovable and unwanted. I honestly feel sick and sometimes I‚Äôm close to puking from the emotional pain.¬†**I‚Äôve never felt wanted by a guy.**¬†In my teen years (I'm now 30F) I was always ignored and discarded in favour of other pretty girls or heck, even my friends. Still to this day, I feel so left out of a conversation when my friends gossip about guys hitting on them and chasing after them. It‚Äôs never happened to me and has made me feel less of a woman. Just yesterday I was sitting with my friends and one of them was talking about how many guys hit on her when she went out last week. I‚Äôm average looking and have a toned skinny body. Like I‚Äôm not even a 1 or an intimidating 10. But there must be something wrong with me.\n\nIt sucks never being the girl that‚Äôs choosen. It just gives you that same feeling like being picked last in a sports game. It‚Äôs an awful feeling. What‚Äôs worse is that for once I thought I got loved and appreciated for once in my life by a guy. I was so happy to finally be noticed by a guy (my ex) but I was treated like annoyance for existing. Like an insect in his face or a rock in his shoe. He would roll his eyes or sigh if I showered him in kisses or showed any affection, like I was bothering him. He would be nonchalant and wouldn‚Äôt even hug me hello if we had been apart while I had gotten ready and been excited all day. I was just there. I thought I had found love but I was emotionally abused for 6 years everyday. I broke up with him 2 years ago. I was never pretty enough to keep his attention or keep it off other girls. T**he hardest part is I try my best and it‚Äôs never enough. I‚Äôm never enough for some reason. I don‚Äôt know what is so wrong with me and what makes me so undesirable. I feel like the clearance rack that no one wants.**¬†There is always some girl that‚Äôs better. I‚Äôm never that ‚Äò‚Äôbetter‚Äô‚Äô in someone‚Äôs eyes. I tried to get back into dating and was on Tinder like a year ago, and I once again got my hopes up with the whole ''Maybe this guy will like me then'' but that just ruined me when he said that ''Your one in a crowd. There is nothing special about you'' and I gave up for a year. I tried again now and I‚Äôve been talking to a guy on an dating app for several weeks and I was so excited to have a date and for a third time had that ''Maybe this guy will like me'' but he cancelled, saying he had a ‚Äò‚Äôheadache‚Äô‚Äô and didn‚Äôt properly reschedule. It feels like my existence is just a bother to guys and they don‚Äôt want anything to do with me. ¬†\n\nLike ‚Äì I‚Äôm not good enough to date and I wasn‚Äôt in his eyes, good enough to sleep with and disgard the next day. I feel so stupid now for even having hopes that something will ever be different. This was just a reminder that no one wants me and I‚Äôm so disposable. I feel so pathetic for reading all my romance books as a teenager and just waiting for that kind of love but now knowing it will never happen. ¬†**I‚Äôll never inspire or give a guy butterflies or have someone be excited about me. I would have just want for once in my life be wanted instead of watching everyone around me have these experiences. It‚Äôs so triggering to see love**. To see people holding hands, kissing or being a couple, knowing no guy wants that with me. Just on Friday, I will be attending a dinner with 5 couples and I will be the only one there without anyone. It‚Äôs just constant reminders how unlovable I am.\n\nI‚Äôm tired of hearing ‚Äò‚Äôlove yourself‚Äô‚Äô ‚Äì ‚Äò‚Äôenjoy the single life‚Äô‚Äô. As if loving yourself takes away the craving for intimacy and love. And there is only so long that the single life is fun, and then comes a point where it‚Äôs painful to the point of being sick to your stomach. I don‚Äôt have a reason to be here anymore. It just feels like I‚Äôm here to love others and never be loved. I'm tired of giving relationship advice and being so lonley. Like I‚Äôll have my friends and family ‚Äì and I‚Äôll go home to my lonely apartment. And that is not a life worth living to me.¬†**Everyday is painful and I don't know how much longer I can take it**",

What i can see is that you struggle with low self-esteem, I don't know for how long, but I'd say for a long time. The way you described what you wanted from relationships and being chased, it seemed to me a romantic view about things in a Shakespearean way. Most human relationships don't work like that, and even the guys hitting on your friends probably were going only for short therm or to formal a social desirable relationship that doesn't necessarily implies deep connection.. I don't know you, but I can imagine there's nothing wrong with you. And about guys wanting to flirt on you... It depends more on our behavior and personality than looks, really. Sure, it is important to be good-looking, but that's not what ultimately defines it.. I've no idea of how much painful your previous relationship was, but I can tell it may have left some holes and sustained some of your old fears and insecurities.. By the way, I'm here if you need someone to talk to. Wish you all the best.",

The only contact now is regarding the kids.\n\nEven after all of that, I'd take being alone now instead of that personal hell.",

I did all that, but I can‚Äôt express these feelings still.‚Äù Well they‚Äôre building up inside. Think of having a bag or a suitcase you‚Äôre packing for vacation. You add stuff into it and you push it down to make more room. Soon you overfill the bag. The bag tears and now you have little spurts of items falling out, and you continue to add more items into the bag. Suddenly the bag rips completely apart and everything comes falling out. You feel bad because it happened and you feel shouldn‚Äôt have let it. Other people fell over the stuff, or got hit with it, and are now hurt. And now this useful bag you had is ruined. That‚Äôs what happens when we can‚Äôt express, right? We all know it. What many people don‚Äôt do is accept the feeling. \n\nRandom person: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm feeling sad because my cat died. I need to be happy, but I can‚Äôt they were my best friend. They brought so much joy to my life.‚Äù They gave an affirmative of ‚ÄúI am sad‚Äù but they didn‚Äôt accept the feeling. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm feeling sad because my cat died. That‚Äôs ok, I‚Äôm allowed to feel sad. I‚Äôm going to *allow* myself to feel this emotion.‚Äù Once you‚Äôve had your time with it, I don‚Äôt recommend for too long, you move it aside. ‚ÄúOk, I‚Äôve had my time of being sad. It‚Äôs time for me to move onto to the rest of my day.‚Äù\n\nThe feeling of sadness is still going to be there. What you‚Äôre doing is allowing yourself to accept the feeling, acknowledging it‚Äôs there and being ok with it being there. Being ok with it being a part of you. Show up for your emotions and let them out, alone if needed, but then it‚Äôs ok to move them aside. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve had my time with you, sadness, I need to make room for my other emotions also. I need to make time for me to do work, or chores, or be with my loved ones.‚Äù \n\nI hope this helps.",

It‚Äôs honestly embarrassing. I don‚Äôt really talk to anyone else. Maybe my mom, barely. My phone is dry. No notifications except ads or spam. I keep writing and spiraling and writing again. And I‚Äôm so tired.\n\nHere‚Äôs my story.\n\nI‚Äôm 22, a nursing student in Canada. I‚Äôve been losing weight aggressively, grinding at the gym, doing cardio, tracking food, trying to build a body I can be proud of. I stopped PMO in January. Haven‚Äôt relapsed since. I‚Äôve been working part time while juggling school and trying to stay on track, but I‚Äôve been breaking down in waves. Not loudly, just spiraling in my head - checking old group chats, rewatching old saved TikToks, imagining memories that never happened. Every time I zone out, I come back feeling worse. There‚Äôs no one really checking in, and even when I‚Äôm around people, I still feel invisible.\n\nMy family life is tough. I don‚Äôt have a relationship with my dad. I‚Äôm an only child. No siblings. No real emotional outlet. Sometimes I feel like I‚Äôm screaming into the void.\n\nI got caught up in this ‚Äúgroup‚Äù at school‚Äîme, two girls, and sometimes others. It felt like a light in my life. For the first time, I felt like I belonged. I asked one of them out, got rejected, and then everything got awkward. She stopped acknowledging me in class. I tried to be cool, then funny, then distant. Nothing worked. I spiraled over it these last few weeks. Breadcrumbs. Power dynamics. Overanalyzing every emoji, every message, every silence.\n\nI lost my dignity trying to ‚Äúkeep the group alive.‚Äù I acted like the glue, but I was just bleeding emotionally. I‚Äôm scared I ruined it 15 times over.\n\nI‚Äôve done everything ‚Äúright.‚Äù Went to the gym. Cut off dopamine. Tried to eat clean. Focus on school. And still I feel empty. I feel like I missed my chance. Like everyone has their social circles and I‚Äôm just some awkward guy orbiting people who don‚Äôt care. I keep watching old TikToks I saved and imagining myself making them laugh, like we‚Äôre in a car on a road trip. Then I snap back to reality, alone in my room, feeling like a loser.\n\nI‚Äôm scared of therapy because I don‚Äôt want to use it as an excuse. Like ‚Äúoh I didn‚Äôt make friends cuz I‚Äôm not in therapy yet.‚Äù But I also know I need something. I just don‚Äôt know what. Every time I go outside, I remember the moments we had. Every time I try to make new friends, I feel like I‚Äôm too much, or I‚Äôm too awkward, or I missed the boat.\n\nAnd I‚Äôm scared that maybe this is just how life is. Maybe there is no light. Maybe this is what the raw brain feels like without porn or fake connections. Just endless spirals and silence.\n\nI don‚Äôt know if this is a cry for help. Maybe it is. I just need someone to tell me I‚Äôm not crazy. That it gets better. That I didn‚Äôt ruin everything. That I‚Äôm not alone.\n\nIf you read this, thank you. I‚Äôm sorry it‚Äôs long. I just needed to get it out of my system.",

So as far as shit sandwiches I definitely know how to chow them fuckers down. \n\nI get being tired. I tried to off myself 3 times over the years. But it never worked for some reason. Something always got in the way. The last one was the night I was just gonna use a gun and my wife messaged me out of the blue. So I put it down and started talking to her. \n\nI'm not telling you this to make you feel worse I promise. The moral of that little glimpse into my garbage fire of a life is that even though shits bad right now. It can get better. I promise. Its ok to be tired and ready to go. Its ok to be angry at the world and the people that arent there for you when you need them. Its ok to be sad and lonely. \n\n  \nAll of these things make you stronger in the end. Even if its not what you want to be. We who suffer heal the best. I believe that whole heartedly.

The last 2 are friends from college, we'd be this \"trio\" and spend a lot of our time together. Everything felt balanced in my life, i was very glad with the friends i had and i had been enjoying my recent years until now. \n\nI've recently went through a very rough patch in life, around October/November i went through a burnout/depressive episode, i had no energy to hangout, talk or see anyone. I was just going into my own bubble and spend the days inside my room. I was still keeping myself busy with personal interests, but i couldn't do anything else. College became a struggle and i had to drop several subjects because i couldn't keep up anymore. \n\nI tried to let everyone know it wasn't personal and i had to take some time for myself, after awhile i was slowly trying to connect again with that core group. But unfortunately it didn't go well with everyone, I've lost the bestfriend from highschool and they completely went no contact, they deleted me and made sure this decision was on me. I just struggled with reaching out to everyone in one go, i was taking it step by step, it's not easy to immediately comeback and act like I'm completely okay again when i wasn't. I was so drained that i couldn't even mentally \"realize\" what this meant, i think i just impulsively accepted it.  \n\nSome months later, another issue took place, the 2 friends from college that i used to be a trio with started to feel like we didn't work with the three of us anymore, they both couldn't get along anymore so now i have seperate connections with them. \n\nThis all has been difficult because i just suddenly feel like i lost all balance, i don't know who to call my close friends anymore, who am i really connected to, do they care for my presence or am i just a \"hangout\" friend, during the time that I've lost the balance in my core group, i was also getting to know 2 new people but I've just been going through some sort of crisis, i really struggle with sudden changes in my life that i wasn't prepared for, and i keep on feeling \"off\". I still go out and do activities, but i don't feel like these are people that -really- connect with me. They like me like i like them, but I'm not a close person or person that they want to deeply connect with beyond \"fun talks and activities\" i barely hear from them and I'm at this point of like \"do i need to re-evaluate my deep connections?\" \n\nDoes this make sense or sound relatable to anyone?

                        "comment": "This is totally relatable to me. As I grew and developed emotional maturity in my early twenties, so many (all) of my close friendships broke down. I was isolated and devastated at the time, but looking back on it now, I realised I had outgrown my friendships and those connections were not making me feel ‚Äòseen‚Äô. It took a few years to learn how to make deep connections with new people. Growing up with someone makes it easy, but in adult friendships, I‚Äôve learned it‚Äôs so much harder to really connect. Now I try to be really present with the person or people, really understand how I feel in their presence, and be radically open and honest. If I feel like I‚Äôm pretending to be someone I‚Äôm not, that‚Äôs a sign that either my ego is getting in the way (making it impossible to connect on a human level) or maybe it‚Äôs more simple - I‚Äôm in the wrong place and haven‚Äôt quite found ‚Äòmy people‚Äô yet. I eventually did find ‚Äòmy people‚Äô but it was a gruelling multi-year process of intense loneliness, trial and error experimentation in my social life which can be quite messy at times. \n\nAlso, acknowledge and appreciate that you have likely grown as a person. Some self discovery may be required. A mentor mine shared this phrase ‚Äòwisdom is like rainwater, it collects at the low points.‚Äô Depression can be a source of wisdom. Your episode of burnout is a signal from your body. Listen to it and trust yourself. \n\nTLDR: It‚Äôs hard but making new connections is worth it. Put yourself out there at a pace that feels right for you. Gravitate towards communities/hobbies/activities which actually excite you. Do the work to allow yourself to be open and vulnerable with new people. Stay present and listen to your emotions. Let them guide your social interactions.",

Or should i be and feel like the same person around everyone... as of now it feels like i only have those connections with my immediate family members, but around my friends i suddenly feel like a fraud, a huge imposter syndrome.\n\nMaybe this was indeed my sign/timing to realize i need to seek new people which is like you mentioned not as easy anymore when you become older .. did i ever connect as deeply as i thought i did with them, or was i just tolerating certain things, just a lot of questions and reflection lol.¬†\n\nI appreciate your insights on this topic, you worded that really well !

                "text_body": "As the title says, today was my birthday (35M), and as expected, nobody cared or did anything. To be precise, I only received a WhatsApp message from my mother, who is the only person I have in my life right now. She is quite old and lives in my home country.\n\nI never had many friends, mostly acquaintances. I did have a girlfriend some years ago; we were together for several years, but unfortunately, the relationship was very toxic for me. She was extremely jealous and violent, and we eventually broke up.\n\nAfter that, I tried to reset my life, to set a new and ambitious goal and pursue it. In doing so, I left everything behind. I also took the opportunity to reflect on my loneliness and to work on being better, to actively try to do things right, to recognize my mistakes, and to improve what I could control. I got in good shape, learned to take care of myself, to look good, to go to the gym consistently, and to improve whatever could be improved, to become the best version of myself and, by extension, a good prospect as a friend and a partner.\n\nWhen it came to interactions with others, I became kinder, more respectful. I offered help whenever I could, even when it wasn‚Äôt asked for. I tolerated things I normally wouldn‚Äôt. I listened and offered support. I genuinely wanted to be a good person.\n\nHowever, none of that worked at all. I am absolutely and completely alone. My phone never receives messages from anyone, other than group messages related to academic activities and spam. Sometimes, I crave something as simple as a hug, just wishing I had someone to hold. For several reasons, I can‚Äôt have a pet, and even if I could, what I need is human interaction.\n\nOver the years, birthdays have been the worst days of all, for obvious reasons. They‚Äôre when I most strongly feel my loneliness and my longing for someone in my life. But this time, something was different. I guess it was resignation. I didn‚Äôt feel anything particularly worse than the usual sadness and pain. I think I‚Äôve finally accepted my reality, and that it can‚Äôt be changed. I think I no longer have any tears left. I feel dry inside. ",

However, after spending time in a friendgroup (that I got kicked out of BECAUSE two of the people in the friendgroup had an argument with two of my other friends outside of the friendgroup...storytime=for another time) for under a year, the sheer awkwardness of the group when I was in it (like how it felt when talking to them, or even watching how they interacted with each other (which was the same with when they interacted with me) was honestly super awkwardd (E.G. real awkward silences n everything)) and I sincerely believe that that may be one of the more significant things that had led to my incapabilities in reverting back to my outgoing nature (in addition to my response to the rumors that were directly about me as well, which were all false). Now since we have to prepare for our GCSE's, my (new) friends (in my current friendgroup) and I are studying/revising independently so we don't go out as much as I'd like....at all, so I honestly don't feel like this is good practice for the next school at all >:( ...But they're lovely so it's okayy :)\n\nReason I'm moving schools: In the UK, high school practically ends at 16 but a Canadian high school would end at 18 so :) ..... im not running away",

Just accept what is and let go of what is not meant.\n\nMay you have wonderful friends and experiences in life!",
