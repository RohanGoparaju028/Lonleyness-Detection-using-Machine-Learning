She happened to have connections with people thanks to Facebook. When we met she was super polite to me and we had fun during the dance. She let me put on my metal stuff on the car ride because she was genuinely curious as to what I listened to, and afterwards she said we could stay in contact and maybe meet up over the summer.

(I'm average looking and no girl has shown interest in me since high school 2017)\n\nMy best friend disagreed and she said \"No, you are handsome.\" I told her I wish many girls shared the same opinion.\n\nBut I also thought to myself that she's my best friend, of course she's not gonna say I'm plain-looking. (actually, I think some best friends would actually say to your face you are ugly lol)\n\nSo I doubted if she was being genuine or just being a bro as I am indeed convinced that it is absolutely looks are why no one is interested in me. When I look at myself in the mirror, even when I dress well and groom myself, I only see an average plain-looking dude. I am also 5'6 or 167 cm. I don't really care about height these days anymore though so I won't discuss further.\n\nI am also not socially awkward or anxious. I am extroverted and talkative and most of my friends and close friends are women. Some of them also say I am funny. I also have good hygiene.\n\nThis is why I see typical normie advice such as \"looks don't matter much\", \"be friends with women\", \"be funny\", \"take a shower\", and \"have a good personality\" as disingenuous because I do all that and still end up not attractive.\n\nIn spite of all thise, I feel happy and uplifited since I don't remember the last time a girl or woman called me handsome (even my mom doesn't and she mocks me sometimes). It gave me confidence to ask my crush out. I hope she says \"yes\" and I can finally leave this sub. I hope she thinks I'm handsome, too.",

I was awkward, stuck in a career that didn’t inspire me, lacking confidence, and quietly resentful of the world—and of myself.\n\nI didn’t have some magic moment or overnight success story. I just kept going. I kept trying. I looked outward. I stayed open. I tried to love myself—even when I didn’t feel lovable—and I tried to love others, even when I didn’t feel loved back.\n\nAnd over time, things changed. Slowly. But they changed.\n\nIf there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that wallowing in bitterness and blame never brought me closer to connection. But taking action did. Walking. Running. Getting involved in things. Reaching out. Saying yes. Trying new things. Building things. Helping others. Failing. Learning. Failing again.\n\nI want to say something that might sting—but might also free you: You’re not broken. You’re just stuck. And you don’t have to stay stuck.\n\nYou’re not doomed to be alone forever. But you do have to start moving. Not toward someone else—but toward yourself. Toward the version of you that you respect. The version of you who’s emotionally strong, curious, generous, and growing.\n\nBeware the voices that tell you to hate women, or society. That energy might feel powerful—but it keeps you locked in pain. People like Andrew Tate? They aren’t your friend. Even the “positive” stuff he says is tied up in poison, and too many people can’t separate the two.\n\nIf you want power—real power—build yourself. Step outside. Get uncomfortable. Try. Fail. Connect. Volunteer. Join something. Lift yourself up, not so you can dominate others, but so you can meet others where they are, as an equal.\n\nYou don’t have to be perfect. You just have to begin.\n\nI believe in you. I mean that.",

I do understand.\n\nI didn’t win the lottery. I didn’t suddenly become hot or rich. But I did get sick of feeling hopeless—so I started taking responsibility for myself and making really small changes. It wasn’t magical, and it was lonely as hell most of the time. But it helped. And over time, it built into something real.\n\nThe one thing that helped me most? Marginal gains. Tiny improvements. I just kept failing forward, learning from every setback, and gradually building a better version of my life.\n\nIf I could go back and give myself some advice, it would be this:\n\n1. Start really small—like “tidy your room” small.\nDon’t try to fix everything. Just take one thing—your space, your routine, your health—and improve it by 1%. Then do it again. Confidence grows from consistent action, not from big wins. Start where you are. Jordans Peterson’s “tidy your room” sounds so silly until you realise it’s about taking control of your immediate world. Get one small part of your life together. Then another. You build self-respect from small wins.\n\n2. Make friends—real ones. Online if you have to, in real life if you can. Not just dating. Message people here. Ask for a call. Start a Discord. Find one decent human being to talk to, even just to share memes and vent. The more people you can speak to on the phone or in person, the better it gets. Friendship is often the piece that’s missing.\n\n3. Befriend men and women—without trying to get anything.\nFind people you can be real with. People you don’t need to impress. It resets your brain. It teaches you how to connect—not to win something, but just to relate. That’s powerful.\n\nI'm not here to preach. Just offering what helped me—because I know what it’s like to feel stuck. \n\nI genuinely wish everyone here the best in their struggles and their journeys.",

                "text_body": "Weeelll... to be honest, that's just part of it. I doubt more than a handful of people will even read this. Maybe the automod will straight-up filter it out. Some of you will probably feel like this is more empty, self-aggrandising wank written by normies who want to gloat about their success. But maybe someone will recognise themselves in my experiences. And writing swathes of text is just really cathartic. So if this helps even one person, I'm happy. **Tl;dr at the bottom.**\n\nA few things to preface this write-up: I'm not in some glamorous place, living it up with my harem after I miraculously grew ten inches in more ways than one, if that's your idea of success. I'm still broke, struggling and in college, don't like talking to people and by society's account \"a loser\", but none of that matters to me the way it did before. Also, I'm a 25-year old brown guy, so my experiences might not align with all the people on the FA spectrum. Also also, it's up to you to decide if I was ever even FA, since that already is a pretty abstract label. Nonetheless, it's how I felt. Didn't have any severe physical shortcomings, other than being pretty short, but not really any \"attractive\" features either. And I was soul-crushingly lonely\n\nI first realised I was FA when I was 19. After a series of specific experiences, I realised I had no idea who I was, who I wanted to be, how I got here, what goals to outline, how I wanted to achieve them, etc., etc. I had no life skills to speak of, barely made it through high school, little social skills and barely any real life experience. Feelings of aimlessness and lackadaisicality were always there in my subconcious, but were silenced with a little voice, deluding myself into thinking that everything will work out fine in the end. But seeing as all the ones whom I thought were like me were now moving on with their life, onto bigger and better things, I looked at myself in the mirror and thought...\n\n##I am a loser...\n\nI've always joked about it and half-heartedly thought I accepted it... but fully realising it and being forced to swallow that harsh truth felt a lot more bitter than I thought it would. My biggest dream was to find a girlfriend, but who would want someone as incapable and unlovable like me? I don't even have any cool hobbies or interests like most other FA losers, I didn't even listen to music. If there was someone out there somehow deluded enough to give me a chance, is this the version of me they'd fall madly in love with? I don't want to shirk the responsibility of becoming the best version of myself onto someone already doing me a favor by going out with a useless nobody like me. \n\nThere's a lot more to be said about who I was and how I started figuring out how my brain worked, but this write-up is already longer than I expected, so I'll keep the following sections a lot more concise.\n\n\n###The things that kickstarted my desire to change:\n\nI refused to acknowledge that this was gonna be me for the rest of my life, whether it be because I was motivated to change, or my loser life had given me delusions of grandeur and I subconsciously looked down on people.\n\n\n\nSince I didn't know who I was and what I wanted, I looked back on my childhood and tried remembering the things I was passionate about, and why and when I stopped caring. I realised I used to be passionate about many things; things that were deemed \"gay/unmasculine and for nerds\". Extreme pressure forced me to try and conform to expectations of masculinity, but in doing so, it had simultaneously caused me to **literally unlearn how to enjoy myself,** and made me feel like worthless for failing to \"attain\" masculinity.\n\nI had little interest in fashion, but wanting to improve myself, I spent what little money I had on some clothes, and I built up the courage to try them on in my room. I felt so embarrassed. They were regular clothes, but still it almost felt like I was crossdressing - and that made me so mad. Why? Why, when I spent the little money that I have on myself to try on some clothes I thought might be cool, am I sitting here *in my own room*, not allowing myself to feel good about it? That anger broke me, and made me realise something I hope to instill on everyone here: **Unless there might be physical repercussions, try your best to this specific type of discomfort when exploring new ideas. You are denying yourself an infinite amount of amazing possibilities and experiences.** This was how it started for me and I now feel like I have a great fashion sense. It's really become one of my favorite creative outlets.\n\nFrom that moment on, almost every time I had some kind of reaction to anything, I took a step back to think about why I had the reaction the way I did. It really revealed to me how much I wasted my energy caring about asinine stuff, both in reference to what people thought of me and what I thought of them. I realised I could be unflinchingly mean, because all my subconscious thoughts were telling me that they hated me anyway. The internet was rife with \"cringe-culture\" and I became grossed out by it overnight. \"You know what, why do I care when I could just not? These people seem a lot happier than me, that's for sure.\"\n\n###Taking action\n\n>*Recontextualising things for yourself might help you realise that you care too much about stupid stuff, but unlearning that reaction is still extremely tough.*\n\nThis is one of the biggest positive changes I've made. The first time you try something, it feels \"cringe\", you start doubting yourself. \"Maybe they were right, this is kinda stupid,\" and you feel defeated. But if you have even the slightest feeling you wanna try again, do it. Things will be different, I promise you. Any inkling of progress helps you better understand what you want and how you want to do it. Though some things you'll still find stupid. I wanted to be more social, and now I try my best to avoid talking to people that aren't my friends. I was lucky to have a lot of free time on my hands around 19 - 21 and almost all hobbies and personality traits I've cultivated were the result of me investing more time and resources into things that piqued my interest, trying my best to muffle the little voice in me that told me I was cringe. Plenty of bad financial decisions were made, though.\n\nI grew out my hair, despite me thinking it would look awful, and it became the biggest reason I had any confidence at all. I got an ADHD diagnosis, which helped me tremendously. For a long time, I would never have wanted to try and find out something like that. I didn't want one more flaw to add to the laundry list of things that made me a failure. But due to silencing that little voice, I allowed myself to see it for the eye-opening diagnosis that it was. I became less worried about \"feeling/looking stupid\", and instead wanted to feel proud about being knowledgeable. It made me more eager to learn about all the little things I didn't know. I used to subconsciously categorise things as \"Stuff I am capable of doing\" and \"Stuff normal people are capable of doing\". But with every little nugget of knowledge I gained, I became more aware as to how stupid that was, too. Instead, I started asking myself \"What are they doing, and what is the distance between me and them?\" I gained an enormous amount of insight because I had accepted that it's okay to not know things. And over time, every time I looked into the mirror, I saw a unique combination of attributes that I felt increasingly happier to recognise as *me*, all because I decided to ignore the what ifs. Unfortunately for me though, taking care of long hair is still a pain in the ass :')\n\n>*If something doesn't work out, you might feel defeated, but you'll eventually forget all about it. If something does work out, it might pay out a life time of dividends. Please don't consider investing in yourself as something \"wasteful\". Do you not think you're worthy of having nicer things?*\n\nI also finally started dating at age 20 and learnt a lot about that, too, but that's such a fustercluck of random unrelated experiences that I cba adding it to the write-up. I already got waaaayyy too invested into this lmao. If you found any of this useful, feel free to ask for whatever in the comments.\n\n**Tl;dr:**\n\n- **I realised my shortcomings and started working on accepting them.**\n\n- **Accepting said shortcomings had the cascading effect of finding out just how well and truly f*cked I was (not sure if the auto-mod would let me swear).**\n\n- **The more I learnt to accept these aspects, the less unpleasant they felt to face, and the easier it became to start changing my behaviour.**\n\n- **Changing my behaviour not only led me to new opportunities, but also allowed me to see those opportunities from a fresh perspective.**\n\n- **Willingly engaging in new things, regardless of how \"cringe\" it felt, or how other people might judge me for it, imbibed me with new knowledge, a lot of which I didn't know I had previously missed out on**\n\n- **New knowledge helped me better curate my interests, allowing me to broaden my horizon while simultaneously tightening my scope onto the things I care about most.**\n\n- **Allowing myself to learn/try more and more things helped me make bigger and better changes, which motivated to continue making change. A clearer version of my identity began to emerge.**\n\n- **These changes, over time, put distance between the version of me that I was leaving behind, and helped me get closer to the better version of myself that I was becoming. I became increasingly happy looking into the mirror and seeing a 'me' I associated with a positive image, rather than one of failure.**",

Yeah, part of it is basically Pavlov'ing yourself and yeah the changes gave me dopamine rushes, but that's not the reason, since those rushes eventually stop - which is something you also kinda have to learn how to deal with. No, it's really more like \"I get it\". I didn't like fashion, because I had no money as a high school kid, and I really didn't like the way I felt I needed to dress. This was once again because of a lack of exposure. I started visiting vintage stores, and thrifting. It was initially challenging putting together outfits from random pieces, but I could find high quality affordable clothes, and I started having fun the more I could mix and match outfits. I was happy because I didn't have to conform to buying outfits I thought were lame after all. And what's more? I don't hate myself 'a little less'; I actually don't hate myself *at all* any more. I really never thought this day would come. Coming back to what I said about the dopamine rushes: I did indeed start buying more and more stuff I didn't necessarily need, because I got a rush out of scoring a good deal. Good quality stuff, mind you, but I sort of justified it by telling myself \"I got a good deal and it's really worth the price\". But that didn't change the fact that I spent money I could have better utilised on something I didn't need. Of course new challenges will present themselves, but you learn how to deal with those too. \n\n>But wholly being an FA is a byproduct of a sick society that keeps hope in the potential for better when there's issues more relevant to their current scenario that's beyond being changed than even attaining something better.\n\nI sorta get what you mean, but could you elaborate?\n\nedit: I just saw on your profile that you live in India, and yeah, I don't know how applicable my situation is to yours.

There's always a set of outliers that say something else and behave elsewise.\n\n\nComing back to what you said about sexual value being derived from some undecipherable mix of eugenics, I feel that it's worth pointing out that people are more capable of exerting control over that mix than they realise. We humans often attach ourself to the idea that something either 'is' or 'is not', when the reality is much more complex. Picture a pancake: if you forget the eggs or milk, you have an issue. You don't know what the mixture is, but it's undoubtedly not a pancake. But if you forget to add the sugar, you still have a pancake - albeit one that isn't sweet. Unfortunate, but on the bright side, you can still make a hearty wrap by adding some meat and veggies. You could have retroactively made it sweeter by adding some powdered sugar, but by recognising a potentially better use-case and adjusting course, you utilised that sugar-less pancake to the greatest extent possible. In that same sense, you can adjust how your mix comes together. Long hair can make someone look more masculine or feminine; the only difference between a skirt and a kilt is the hairy Scotsman who's wearing it, etc.\n\nAnd that is why trying new things is so important; because you and other people don't know what that mix needs. Which is why that great reset can and will *never* happen - other than the fact that many people have different ideas as to what something 'means'. As conceited as it sounds, and as cringy as it feels to say, **the average person is akin to an npc**. People need a clear-cut trajectory to follow or they fear they'll fall through the cracks and stray further from all the things they have, for the most part, been ingrained to want. The average person either doesn't know, doesn't care for or straight-up dismisses the idea that there could be something anyone would want beyond the clothes they've been subconsciously conditioned to wear, the degree and carreer path they've indifferently chosen, and the loveless marriage they decided to commit to. They think that wearing nice clothes and having a nice, heterosexual marriage is just something you do. And tight jeans and a burning hatred for your spouse is just part of how it is. Bringing back the pancake analogy to explain why the average person is so pissawful at giving advice about this. They do not know your pancake has no sugar. You probably wouldn't know why your pancake wasn't sweet either, so it's difficult to blame them. They keep insisting that you're a pancake, so therefore you must be sweet. And if cherries and whipped cream helped them, it obviously must help you. Like the allegory of Plato's cave; the pancake is all they have ever seen. They don't know about the ingredients.\n\nThe world will ***never*** be fair. As we enter our 20s, it can be difficult to fully realise the weight and extent of that statement. When normies say \"Learn what works for you\", they're not (or should not be) imploring you to find your own way to achieve what they have achieved, it's that you should find your own means of living, create your own footholds and stepping stones, and most importantly, learn to create your own measurement of success. Because,\n\n**A.** *You can always move the goal posts with money and status, because there will always be someone richer and more successful, and it'll sting extra hard when that person is, in all likelyhood, a complete fuckhead.* \n\n**B.** *You're doing that right now and your brain is already telling you that it's stupid and it shouldn't work like that.*\n\nIt does for many people but it might not have to be you, y'know? Your income and status will most likely be left to the whims of people who don't think beyond what they're having for dinner that day. If you want to be content, trying something different is really the *only* option you have. I don't know if it's a cultural thing, but I had a similar interaction with an Indian guy I worked with. I work a shitty job part time, but I just do it so I can afford my education. I'd like to be doing something different, but money's money. He, on the other hand, utterly *despised* the idea that he was working there, when he could be working somewhere \"better\". I could see in his eyes that he was frustrated with himself, every day. I asked him \"Better? Such as?\". He would respond something like a doctor or a politician, because his family members were all working jobs like that. When I asked if it was something he really wanted to do, he said yes. Why? \"Because of the money and status\". So frustrated, and yet I'm certain he will never escape it. Money and status are not shorthand for satisfaction, and failing to attain it, despite knowing you're fully capable of doing so, is no reason to torture yourself. They're just means to an end (if you're a sane person, that is), them being a safe and reliable social circle and the means to live comfortably without some financial Sword of Damocles constantly looming over your head.\n\nIf possible, I would urge you to expose yourself to other cultures. Doesn't necessarily mean travel, but it could help better highlight how you feel about your place in Indian society, and potentially uncover new opportunities. And, of course, just doing stuff. Your brain can logically deduce when things are true or make sense, but actually experiencing it allows you to really accept it as \"truth\". Let me know what you think if you read the whole thing.",

Yeah, there are a lot of people out there for whom it's just over from the start, but there are SO many more people out there who haven't even scratched the surface of all the things they could do or could have done, because they barely expose themselves to anything. I'm a naturally curious guy and I like to randomly click on people's profile, and holy hell, you would not believe how many people here are below 18. *18!* I'm not even that old and I have YouTube accounts and e-mail addresses older than that; and these people already claim that it's \"over\". And almost any time someone posted a photo of their face, it's crystal clear they don't even remotely take care of themselves: fat, greasy, sad-looking, unshaven, and for some reason often arguing with anyone who even remotely tries to give them advice. Of course that's also not necessarily reflective of everyone here, but to me it just seems so statistically unlikely for it to be completely, irrefutably over for even more than 30% of the people here.\n\n\n>You can try physical changes, you can try to skill up, get multiple income sources, you can try social mixing events, but at the end of the day your success is relatively on marketable sexual value. You can't decipher it, it's just weird mix of eugenics that's beyond me or anyone else. It's not a gender thing, both sides just suffer from it.\n\n\nWhat do you consider success? And which market's evaluation are you taking? Ignorant normies might respond with things like \"You have to determine your own level of success\" or \"You need to stop worrying about other people's opinions.\" Both true, but completely devoid of context. \n\n\nThis is where my Euro-bias completely comes shining through, but bear with me:\n\nYou are assigned a set of characteristics, both inherent and by the way you've been nurtured. Things you could be good at, things you could be not so good at; physical characteristics such as your hair, height, body-type, perhaps unique identifiers, etc.; mental wellbeing and the degree in which you are pressured or even mandated to change yourself in order to adapt to your surroundings.\n\n**THERE IS NOT A SINGLE PERSON OUT THERE SO SELF-AWARE THAT THEY CAN CATEGORICALLY LIST THESE ATTRIBUTES ABOUT THEMSELVES, AND ACCURATELY NUMERICALLY CALCULATE HOW MUCH IT'S F*CKED THEM OVER.**\n\nBecause it's not possible. And the reason I find that important to mention, even though I can tell from the way you speak and the things you say that you are intelligent enough to have already realised this, is that that 70% of people I mentioned earlier have no logical reason to justify giving up completely.\n\nYou *can* indeed point out things that are undoubtedly seen as 'negative' qualities by some people, and that those people will unfairly and arbitrarily treat you completely different for it, much to the dismay of those weirdos at inceltears. Indian people, for instance, are (mostly unfairly) put through the ringer by westerners, and (definitely unfairly) being associated with rapey scam call center employees. Short people have a whole host of social issues that get completely dismissed; being seen as significantly less desirable dating partners probably being the least of their issues (seriously, look it up if you haven't already). India specifically has relatively strict cultural norms to abide by, especially for those in lower castes, and it's easy for someone intelligent and reluctant (or unable) to adapt to become disillusioned (not necessarily meaning you, btw). These are things outside of your control that are definitely going to impact the way you're treated in society. But to *what* extent do they?\n\n\nAnd what about the positive? Things you can do to, for lack of a better word, 'offset' these things? Even if you were solely doing these things to get closer to your vision of success, can you empirically prove to yourself that, for example, it would be useless to learn how to cook, because it won't make up for being short? You're Indian, big man. You should learn how to cook because Indian food is baller, and knowing how to cook it is even more baller - this is just hypothetical, of course. Even if you initially do things for the prospect of social gain, the worst thing that could happen is that you spent some money and time on something you ended up not caring about. Trust me, it sucks having read up on every kind of study that will reinforce perceived unfairness, but the point I'm trying to reiterate is that, despite the numbers being stacked against you, and being faced with the prospect of completely abandoning hope, is it really so much better to shoot yourself in the foot because of it? There is so much you or I don't know about things. Not to mention we can do everything right and still fail.",

Of course, his statement is a *trust me bro*, anecdotal at best. However, some claims can be proven right, and I'll give some on behalf of him.\n\nOne simple argument of authority regarding the sentiment \"Some people just aren't meant for relationships\" is:\n\n>Citing recent DNA research, Dr. Baumeister explained that today’s human population is descended from twice as many women as men. Maybe 80 percent of women reproduced, whereas only 40 percent of men did.\n\nThat is enough to say that not everyone had the opportunity to find a partner. Now, you may say that the number only accounts for people who actually had children, not those who were together but never had children. I don't have information on that.\n\nMoreover, the sense of the phrase includes the sentiment that some people, groups of people, &c., never get to enjoy relationships. We could be talking about neurodivergent people as well! And some polls made here some time ago show that there is a high number of users who suspect such a diagnosis, while some others are clinically diagnosed.\n\n[This ](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262581068_Brief_Report_Parent-Child_Sexuality_Communication_and_Autism_Spectrum_Disorders)report has an interesting table (viz. Table 1), where HF (high-functioning) participants reported that only 7.7% had admitted to having a romantic/sexual relationship. Now, admittedly, the median/mean age for the participants was 14. So, to be fair, there's this other [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34404502/). I'll quote:\n\n>Data were drawn from the 2017 Swiss study on sexual health and behaviour among young adults. A total of 5175 participants (mean age 26 years ± 0.01) were divided into virgins and non-virgins. Virginity was defined as never having had a sexual partner, defined as a person with whom the participant has had sexual contact with or without penetration.  \n*Results*: A total of 275 (5.3% (95% CI: 4.7-6.0), 58% males) were virgins. Virgins had higher odds of being male (aOR: 2.27 (95% CI: 1.62-3.17)) and reporting poorer health (1.43 (1.07-1.92)).  \n*Conclusions*: Among young adults, 1 in 20 is a virgin. Virgins do not seem to have gone through the usual experimentations of adolescence, are less socially driven and reported more health challenges.\n\nAnother [one](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9841819), citing further studies:\n\n>Some emerging adults are virgins because they have a life trajectory marked by an absence of romantic relationships ([Lucas et al., 2019](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9841819/#bibr41-21676968211064109)) or sexual opportunities ([Richards-Shubik, 2015](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9841819/#bibr49-21676968211064109)).\n\nThere. Go on and tell me I'm a hypocrite. I am open and welcome any civil argument. Honestly, I'd *love* to know that I'm actually not doomed, but reality is often disappointing. Sometimes we have to face unwanted realities and move on from there with the cards we have.",

No drama, no fake connections — just people I thought I could rely on.\n\nLately, it feels like they’ve all started pulling away.\n\nOne of them, who I’ve been distancing myself from, had this way of putting me down — subtly, but consistently. Never anything obvious, but enough to chip away at me over time. I finally started stepping back from that dynamic.\n\nNow, it seems like he’s turned another friend against me. That second friend came back to the city recently after a long time. He didn’t even reach out when he got here, even though he told me weeks ago he’d be visiting. I met him today, and the vibe was totally off — distant, uninterested, like we were just casual acquaintances. He’s been staying at the first guy’s place this whole time, so I can guess what’s being said behind my back.\n\nThen there’s my third friend — someone I’ve known since childhood. He’s living abroad now. I’ve tried calling and texting him a few times over the last six months. No reply, except once when he said he’s too busy to even talk to his parents. But yesterday he made time to chat with that second friend. That part stung.\n\nI’m not someone who gets overly emotional or expects constant attention. But when the only people you actually let close start treating you like you don’t matter, it makes you question whether the friendship meant as much to them as it did to you.\n\nI talked to my mom about it, and she thinks the manipulative one poisoned the well. Maybe. I don’t know. I’m not mad — I’m just tired of chasing people who clearly don’t feel the same way anymore.\n\nNot sure if I’m overthinking, or if this is just how life goes. You grow up, and people you thought were solid start acting like strangers.\n\n",

Just like that. \n\nThe truth is, people drift apart over time. Thats why time is the ultimate test of everything. Things aren't always going to be the same as when you first met and became friends (high school, college, etc.). People change over time. You're not the same person you were back in high school, even if you feel that way. \n\nI'm sorry. Its really shitty. Some people just become real POS's over time. And its not your fault. Its easy to think \"well this isn't how things used to be\" but thats its exactly that. That was then. This is now. The worst thing you can do is keep trying to hang out with them when they treat you like shit and blame yourself.",

Or you can just ghost them all/drop them like they have been doing to you and just go cold turkey no contact. Remove them from your phone, socials, etc. And just close the door/chapter in those people.\n\n\n  When people show you they don't care much about you, believe it and walk away from them cause when someone values you and cares about you, they'll make time for you. I too always day dreamed about having a big friend group, but sometimes when the friend group becomes to big one person starts to easily want to push you out the group or you're not as close to some people in your friend group.\n\n\nThat's when I learned you don't need a sea of people to be your friend. All you need is one good friend and if you can't even find that then you be the best damn friend ever to yourself. It may be lonesome at times but at least you know you'll always have your back and won't betray yourself. \n\n\nI've always remember thus peice of advice from my mom:  Some people are in your life for a season and then there are people meant to be there for life time to help you love, learn and grow. If they're a leaf getting ready to fall off the branches, you don't try to to keep them from falling, you let them and focus on the other beautiful healthy leaves that are still there. \n\n\nHope that helps.

I’m so thankful to have a loving family who support me. It really hurts not getting to know what a romantic relationship is like, to go on dates, have sex, make memories. I know it’s not all sunshine and rainbows but I wanted to have a chance to make things work with the right person or even just to have fun. I want to make the most of my life but I feel like I’m being deprived of it. I hate the person it’s turned me into, being desperate for attention and getting jealous of seeing couples in love. My experience with the apps has just been swiping through profiles and then messaging matches (of which I had 3 in total) only to get no replies. It annoys me because I don’t understand why someone would match only to ignore me. I hate how the apps constantly have pop ups and try to push features to me. I never subscribed to anything but I can see why the temptation is there. These companies prey on vulnerable and emotional people just to make money. They try and keep people hooked as long as possible by hiding likes and limiting swipes. There’s also shady people on there like scammers, catfishes or people trying to sell content which is not what the apps are for. There are success stories here and there but they are few and far between. What I think is the worst aspect of dating apps is the toxic culture that’s it’s spawned. There’s a whole discussion to be had about social media in general but the issues are much more prevalent with dating apps. I don’t have a problem with people using the apps correctly and I do hope it can work out well for them. Anyway I’ve ranted on long enough, thanks for reading this far. ",

It showed an alligator snapping turtle hunting fish by using its tongue as bait, opening its mouth wide and wiggling its worm-like appendage in an attempt to lure in a hungry fish. The poor scaly swimmer with the misfortune of becoming that turtle's lunch wasn't necessarily stupid: it took its time to assess the bait, swimming just far enough from the snapping turtle's mouth to get away if it needed to. But hunger got to it eventually, and it swam right into the turtle's reach and got eaten. I don't know how much conscious thought the turtle put into its hunting strategies, but I doubt that it ever considered that it has an appendage on its tongue that looks exactly like a worm. That came from natural selection. \n\nNatural selection is incredible. At some point a few million years ago, a turtle was born with some weird appendage with no obvious practical benefit. That appendage, so far as anyone knows, was due entirely to luck and chance, but it nevertheless turned out to have a handy purpose. Some poor fishes thought that it was a worm and practical gave themselves away to that turtle as food; that turtle was well fed and lived a long life, giving the world many, many babies. Some of those babies had that same appendage, and they were usually better fed, longer lived, and more sexually successful than their appendage-less counterparts. Then most of their babies had it, and they also outproduced their appendage-less siblings, and so on and so forth until no alligator snapping turtle without it was considered normal and healthy. It's an incredible thing. But no one seems to care about the turtles that didn't survive. \n\nLately, I've felt a lot like the turtles that didn't make it through natural selection. My genes are poor for creating someone that makes an appealing partner, and that keeps me from reproducing. Maybe that's a good thing for human civilization; maybe it's best if I don't have any children and pass on my shitty genes. But there's something extremely painful about being the one that doesn't get to do it, about being the one that has to live as the genetic loser. I hate it...hate, hate, hate it. ",

We’re still apes in the end, we breed and die and consume the planet as we do it. Denying that some people are simply born with “superior” genes that make them taller, more conventionally attractive, fitter, better endowed and generally healthier, is pointless. It’s very clearly happening everywhere still. Somebody saying “ooh you two are going to have gorgeous kids some day, those lucky things haha” basically exists on the same level as two herpetologists agreeing that “that snapping turtle’s mates will produce offspring that inherit his superior body mass, musculature and his well-endowed appendage (lol, but true )”",

We all want people who share certain interests with us, but the supply simply doesn't meet the demand. Most women are NOT into male hobbies or interests, making the few who are seem more desirable by comparison.\n\n\nThe big problem is, you are right, you do need a certain degree of compatability or at least mutual respect to make a relationship work. It would be easy to just settle for the first woman that comes along... or so it would seem. In my experience that's not the case as even mid-tier women think they're better than us, and more importantly, don't give mutual respect at all. If you have any hobby or interest that is perceived as \"unmasculine\" then you are mocked and ridiculed for it.\n\n\nThe worst part is that society fosters all of this bullshit too. For all the complaining I see millennials and boomers do about gender roles, they don't WANT women to like comics, or video games, or tabletop RPGs, or cars, or metal, or history, or science. No, rather they'd rather \"sissify\" men and put us down than encourage people to do things that are fun and interesting.",

The people who are seen as desirable, the ones who rise to the top, are ones who have traits that allow them to exploit the current culture. Maybe in a couple hundred years that will change too, especially given how quickly society changes now. Remember, it took our ancestors almost a million years to go from using unifacial stone tools to bifacial stone tools. A million years! But now technology accelerates so quickly that things become obsolete within years, even months. Within your own life time you may have seen the death of dial up modems, landline phones, CDs, VHS tapes, DVDs, payphones... I don't know how old you are.

Remember the American Dream?\n E)Then came the second wave of feminism, which brought loads of women into the workforce although they remained underpaid, overworked, undermined and overlooked. It only increased the total economic workhours and fractured families. Not to mention the role played by artificial inflations in creating markets where two salaries wouldn't suffice rent.\nF) Roads and transport systems were built not to support your average commuter-passenger, no. It was such that a 3 member family owns 3 automobiles and keep on burning that sweet sweet oil.\nG) If you look around today, you'll find even more extreme examples of capitalism induced isolation. I guess if you're on reddit you already know how social media alienates.\n H)Post pandemic when travel resumed, we thought the super productive wfh would still be continued wherever possible. Not only most wfh-ers were summoned back without much increment, but also threatened with redundancies and layoffs. Reason given- AI\nI) Can you imagine the pinnacle of human innovation - artificial intelligence is used to write reports and generate memes, rather than solving climate crisis or cleaning the ocean. Why is replacing jobs the biggest use case of the biggest invention since the light bulb?\nJ) Dating apps have replaced our pubs and playgrounds, where one interacted with the other sex, with three things about you and a photo. You decide your kebab shop based on more facets than that. And for what? Worst case - Sub-Saharan dry conversations and best case - a meaningless shag?\nK) You own nothing. No app. No phone. Not even tractors. Everything is subscribed and licensed to keep making money off you. \nL) Money became religion. I read someone left a promising math PhD to become an onlyfans model. And you know what, I fw that. Given how little a PhD makes, and how often PhDs can be seen flipping burgers outside of their labs, OF is a better paying and more glamorous job. But if you think about it, academia lost a little bit more. \n\n\nTLDR- It's not your fault.

I have no friends outside of a few online ones. My life is just school, work, and then home. My best friend is my cat. \n\nWhat am I going to do? I want to find a way to be happy by myself. I like being alone. But feeling lonely is the worst. I feel like less of a woman and like something must be horribly wrong with me for no one to ever like me. I like women, too, but none of them give me the time of day either. \n\nBisexual, and bi myself. lol. I spend most of my day high to avoid thinking of how hollow my life is. Idk what to do.

I entered the - lets call it - \"great depression\" which lasted almost a decade (which may or may not be related to me not getting over the permanent result of some stereotypical emo behavior). Also dropped my style at this point bc I didn't have the energy anymore to maintain it (but kept the long hair, just fits me better). Being introvert my whole life I basically need to be forced into socialising, which naturally happened in school, but now the only foreign faces I see most of the time are some delivery drivers. End result: 0 dates, 0 hugs, 1 close friend (but not for emotional support, so ...), lonely af which starts to hurt badly. The only thing keeping me somewhat sane is the knowledge that my father (rip) was around 40 when he first met my mother (25; yes, 15y age gap, and some people cant get over a 5y difference ...).

If you meet a guy, become friends, he will be able to talk to you about his pain. And you will be able to give him the understanding he needs.

I pray to the Loving Universe to take you into its loving arms and hold you. Let you feel loved. Not just today. Everyday. Every time you feel alone. Sad. Filled with self doubt. Everytime you need to feel safe, and deeply loved. I pray your Angels embrace you. Your heart.  And you feel Loved.\n\nMy friend. r/ToastMe is my favorite subreddit. It's well run by the Mods and there are so many loving people there who make loving comments to our friends in pain.\n\nI highly highly recommend you copy and paste this post into a post on that sub.♥️",

They set everything up.\n\nOnly traumatic events later in life can \"write\" new subconscious \"code\" or beliefs.\n\nSo the trick to healing is addressing our negative subconscious beliefs.  Neurofeedback therapy resets the brain, but is expensive.\n\n A life long meditation habit will do the trick. It teaches us to step back from our thoughts and see them.  To keep our sense of peace despite them.\n\nAll healthy action we take to *become* our new self, that believes we are beautiful, valuable, and in harmony with a loving destiny... one filled with the love we dream of... are strong steps toward changing our subconscious to support our dreams, instead of... preparing ourselves for disappointment.\n\nExercise, meditation, yoga, finding loving caring people to be friends with in any capacity.... Getting therapy. All great steps.\n\nRepetition impacts the subconscious. Tell yourself you are  beautiful 5 times a day for a year. Tell yourself that you are a source of joy to other people. You are kind. Loving and valuable to your partner (even if you don't have one... Yet.)\n\nWrite a mantra of what you WANT to believe and repeat it 3 times a day. Every day while taking other steps toward being your TRUE self. Who you are without all the impact of negative experiences either young or later... \n\n(I need to take this comment and turn it into a post.)\n\n\"Genuine Happiness\" by Alan Wallace was the book on Meditation I followed.\n\nI apologize for going on and on. I truly hope you find the peace, love and happiness YOU most certainly deserve.🤍",

I asked which date would work for her and she replied with the 14.02. valentines day.\n\nI was obviously really excited, organised everything and cleaned my flat. Then on the morning of valentines day she texts me that she's not feeling well. I felt like shit. It sounded like the cheapest excuse you could come up with. I played along tough as I still couldn't believe that after always showing interest suddenly she would dump me like that. So I wrote with her and wished her the best. and then on Sunday two days later she wrote that she can't imagine a relationship with me but we can be friends.\n\nI declined politely and indicated that I didn't think she was very tactful with her excuse and left it at that.\n\nWhy would someone do that tough. I can understand not being interested and even getting cold feet but just say so. Don't lie and make up excuses.",

I just want to be able to be intimate with someone. I just want someone to love me. Why is that so hard to find? My dad tells me \"let her come to you, she'll come to you in time.\" But he's been saying that for the past decade. That's all he does. He doesn't actually help me meet people. Whenever I explain how I feel to him, he just gets agitated and babbles on about how lonely he feels too, which doesn't make me feel any better. Literally nothing has happened romantically or even like finding a friend who is a woman, in my life at all. No one really seems to care, no one cares.\n\nNothing is happening and nothing is going to happen. I'm done pretending, I'm done hoping. The only thing I want is the answer why, and I don't know. I have no opportunities to meet people. From some small town in the US. I work from home full-time. Dating apps don't work. I am a Christian and have tried Upward for months. I swipe right on every single profile I see, like 200 swipes a day. I get a few, maybe 2 likes a day when I do this, that are literally all comprised of unattractive or overweight women that I just don't feel attracted to. I'm not bashing them. It's just not my thing. And even when I do message them on the app, which I do even though I don't feel attracted to them - because you might as well try, right? - they never respond. I'm not asking for a movie star - just someone who looks even somewhat decent. What is wrong with me, why are girls repulsed from me? Why do they immediately lose interest in me as soon as they see me? What is it about me? I just don't understand it.\n\nI tried eHarmony, which is a scam and no one replied to me on that platform either. It's like the site is dead. I'm not into hookups, so I don't use Tinder. And I tried ChristianMingle to no avail. I don't know what to do. I don't think there's anything I can do. \n\nI just want someone who cares about me, will reach out to me and hug me and love me, but it's just too much to ask from a woman to do that. They're just not willing.\n\nI used to have hope, when I was more ignorant about the world, a long time ago. As the years passed and I started getting older, my hope slowly eroded away. Now I realize it's already too late. I'm supposed to be way farther along in life - I have several mental illnesses that set me back a long way - but no one really cares anyway. Everyone is too wrapped up in their own romantic drama and their own lives to care about me. I just don't understand.\n\nThe few friends that I used to have mostly just told me that I need to be happy single, marriage is not as glamorous as I think, and compared my situation to people worse off than me. Didn't help much.\n\nMy life isn't going anywhere, and my life is consumed by work and depression. I just wish I had a solution.\n\n",

Ugly & attractive are subjective and don't correlate with standards everywhere, but it makes me wonder what you have on your profile for what you are looking for? And how do you describe yourself? These are the two primary failures us guys make on creating profiles, and just reading over your post makes me wonder if we hit on the issue as it raised an eyebrow.\n\nThe apps are shit. Even successful people say the apps are shit, but the worst thing about them is its shopping, so preferences beat out any chance of getting to know the person. You take a photo where the white balance wasn't quite right and while it's fine to you, the other people are focused on if your skin has a greenish tone to it because they're staring at every image like a \"Magic Eye\" image trying to find the fault. It's a bullshit way to find a date. I've also only ever heard and seen love bots and scammers on eHarmony. I'm pretty sure that place died years ago.\n\nMy guess is there's something in your request or about yourself in the profile that's being read wrong. If that could be fixed, there are other ways to advertise your single status to get known, but this does also rely on how small of a town we are talking about? Is there a population there, or are you maybe better off stepping outside the borders and seeing what the women are like outside the community.",

Once you have women in your life as friends you will help break down the mental wall you have in building relationships with them. Besides the benefit of having new friends, you will also have additional insight and perspective into how to approach women romantically and they can guide you in the right direction for tips on things like getting more hits on dating profiles. Also, don’t try and be romantic with these new friends, just allow yourself to have more perspectives from women in your life. I wish you romantic success in your future!",

Of course you need to be careful to not attract gold diggers but with some common sense and deep, honest and straightforward communication you can filter those out.\nAlso your competition is like 50+ year old dudes, so you will get a ton of likes and attention.\n\nEdit: LMAO at all the downvotes.

It's easy to fall into the trap of desperation as you mentioned above in advertising you just need someone to need you. We think honesty is warranted, and it will be reciprocated, but that's not what's happening outward. It's being read as threat.\n\nWhen you go to write your own bio and request on any platform, it needs to be relaxed because you should be, especially in person. I'm not saying write, \"Idk, I like movies and TV, whatever, wanna hang?\" I'm more saying that the request especially should be about now and not 5 years from now. Like, \"I'm just looking for a seat filler for Taco Tuesday and see what happens from that.\"\n\nA common thing i see, especially from men with Christian backgrounds, is they're already planning 5-10-20 years, and they almost write out an instruction manual for the women. And yeah, the desperate notes of needing to be desired is still an instruction and needs to go. And this is where I might hurt you, but hear me out:\n\nNoone deserves a woman, and no one owes you anything.\n\nThis reality statement should be taken to mean, you need to take it easier on yourself and potential dating opportunities. Don't put so much pressure in a time frame or that it is \"supposed\" to happen because that strain you are putting on yourself is sabotaging you. This is what your dad means when he said she will come to you, he's trying to tell you to just relax it a little and be less about having that immediate affection and partnership and make it easier for yourself. Tacos is a chill environment, it's inviting to the girl for a relaxed night and noone is pressured to fall in love as it can take date 3 sometimes.\n\nMy suggestion will come to you as a direct message to stay within sub rules. But there is a window. It's not over if you're still hunting dates. You're also young as shit man. You've got 75% of your life to go.",

If you're getting positive feedback you continue escalating and if you get negative feedback you back off. No matter how much planning you put into it at some point you just have to accept that you're going to be clumsy at first.

I talked to many people and had a lot of friends, though I argued with most of them and was often bullied in group chats. I met most of those people through the **Gacha community**, which, at the time, was the only space where I truly felt like I belonged. Eventually, I grew out of that phase and so did everyone else. I don’t think anyone even likes Gacha anymore. After Gacha, I became sort of a **TikTok star**, and while I did make some friends there too, it wasn’t quite like the community I had in 2018–2019. Still, it was something.\n\n2020 was a calmer year. I started talking to my father’s friend, someone I developed deep feelings for. She was my crush. I was honestly in love with her. But she left me around 2021, and that broke something inside me. After her, I still had a few friends from Instagram and TikTok, but it wasn’t the same anymore.\n\nThen 2022 and 2023 happened.  \nIn 2022, I only had school friends, but that ended quickly when a classmate spread rumors about me about things I supposedly did. That basically killed every connection I had left. In 2023, I tried to stay in touch with a few friends on Instagram, but eventually, they all disappeared. I honestly don’t know how everything just started ending. It’s like I woke up one day and everyone was gone.\n\n2024 and 2025 have been **extremely lonely** for me.  \nI’ve tried finding people on Instagram, Facebook, even Bumble, but nothing. TikTok isn’t an option anymore because I’m barely active, and Reddit is just filled with *thirsty guys*. I’ve been feeling this deep, painful loneliness since 2023, and it’s been killing me slowly.\n\nSchool has never been easy either. No one really wants to be my friend and maybe it’s because of how I look. Right now, in my class (10th grade), there are only 6 students: 3 boys and 2 other girls, plus me. We also have two students from 11th grade who join some classes. They’re friendly with each other, but no one talks to me. I don’t try anymore. I’m scared that if I try and something goes wrong, I’ll end up having to leave school like I had to back in 2021. I just want to survive quietly now. On top of all this, I lost my **maternal grandmother**, who was with me throughout my entire life. Her absence has left a hole I don’t know how to fill.\n\nI don’t understand why even **social media** can’t help me find real friends anymore. I’ve tried so hard. It’s like I’m screaming in a room no one’s in.",

I was gonna bring it up but then she starts talking sexually to me, but then when I reciprocate she pulls away and says she isn’t ready for that. So I mention I saw her post and the feelings are mutual. But she says well now I’m not sure.\n\nA while passes and she asks me to be her boyfriend and I’m really excited. She starts calling me hun and cyber sexts with me and I feel really happy. but then all of a sudden she completely cuts it all off. Won’t do anything sexual, stops calling me hun etc. I try to talk to her about it and she assures me nothing is wrong she just has anxiety.\n\nBut then in February she breaks up with me saying she has no feelings for me and only thought she did. We talked a while and she said maybe it’s because we hadn’t met in person so I said give me til the end of April and I will come out to see you (I live in WV she lives in Kansas) and she agrees.\n\nTwo days…. 2 days! After dumping me, I mention that I’ve met some new online friends who are female and she gets super jealous and stuff. Then she starts acting more flirty and sends me pics of her in her underwear and acts real sexual again.\n\nI ask her to be with me and she says let’s meet first and then we can discuss it and I say okay. Eventually we settle on May 2 because that’s when the amusement park opens. Things seem okay. But then she starts pulling away again and when I bring it up she says she doesn’t have feelings for me. I say, but I was about to pay almost $700 to come see you… she says well I just thought it was as a friend. I just thought we were friends. I ask her do friends show each other dirty pics and masturbate together? She then says I need therapy and that I’m not mentally well.",

Perhaps  looks + weird body language. Idk anymore. Anyway, school, college uni, and even my old workplace I was always the odd one out, who kept to himself and was always excluded from any groups activities. All this because I felt rejected after every attempt to fit in. In fact at uni I made only one friend to whom I still speak to , but he lives far away from me.  Besides him I don't have any other true friends. The rest of my time at uni, I spent rotting in my room playing games,  drawing and completing my coursework. It's not like I didn't try to make friends and socialise, but from all the effort, I just ended up feeling even more depressed and isolated, all because no one returned the effort in getting to know me. In fact, people only focused on my negative traits for instance, \"Why are you so shy\", \"Why do you do this, this, this\" ? . All I was doing is trying to be nice, and engage in a talk, and listen, but still they treated me like something that came out of the sewers.\n\nMy hygiene is good, posture too, I am friendly, good listener, and i've been told that I'm a really chill person. Despite that i always give off weirdo vibes without intending to. On the contrary, I am slightly socially awkward, introverted, but still trying my best to engage.\n\nI know I should be putting myself out there more, go to social events and stuff, but from all the social rejection, isolation, I feel so mentally exhausted and depressed that I don't even have the energy to do anything that involves talking to others.

I wouldn't be compatible with anyone due to my sexual orientation most likely.  I'm introverted, autistic and have an avoidant attachment style.There's other things to consider like financial competence, politics, religion, whether to have kids or not have kids, and goals to consider. There so many big things in dating that I dont think anyone is ever going to check off all of my boxes. Too many things could go wrong and when I talk to anyone I just think they are leading me on or playing me anyways. I'm ugly so the difference holds a major contrast to the treatment I get everyday. I try dating apps but can't find anyone I like. There's just so many obstacles that would lead to divorce and I'm afraid of that also along with having an avoidant attachment style. I'll think I'm lonely but then when I talk to guys I start to feel trapped and second guess what I wished for.I start to replay what they said in my head and then think \"Well since they said x y z they must just be a player.\" There's too much to be skeptical of especially with all the hookup culture where no one wants anything serious. I think I've become disillusioned by love. It can't be that good and if it is it's too good to be true in some way shape or form by either being toxic, or love not being enough to withstand the practical things a relationship needs or the person is just lovebombing just to butter someone up for their own selfish motives. Just when I find myself being optimistic about love I find another part of myself taking the wheel to make me go \"oh... right.\"  There is no way someone is going to actually prioritize me given who I am.

Someone in my city sets up regular game nights at a bar and advertises on reddit.\n\nThen there's shit like volunteering somewhere.

(I don't know which to even recommend, I haven't used any in many years, however still feel this way about them).... Some apps ((if they're good)) aren't necessarily a bad thing. They are a part of \"everywhere\" these days. So set up free accounts wherever you can and set up your profile to be as appealing /(but honest)/ as you can aaand yeah. There are a whole bunch of shit about them and how there's like so many women to every man and the chances and all that, but, at worst, nothing will come of it. I've had some successes with them tho, you just have to advertise yourself properly and more important accurately and be thoughtful about what you're wantin and all that.\n\nAnd while you're in the digital realm, shit, might as well try streaming 🤷‍♂️ People are always watching others doing basically whatever. Painting little model figures or fcking knitting or building computers or just anything. It's kinda crazy lol.\n\nAnyways. There's a method that can be developed to give you the best chances of finding someone somewhere, as friends or partners or whatever, but I think that's sound general advice for most people. Expose yourself to others in whatever way that won't get you arrested. But even if we don't know where to go there is always a place to explore.",

And most women are not as ugly as they believe they are.\n\nWith that said, I checked your post history and...yeah, I think we found some bigger issues. The impression I'm getting is that you're obsessed over your weight, dieting, and getting attention. (And the astrology thing isn't fantastic either.) Besides setting possibly unrealistic dietary standards for yourself, it kinda sounds like you're sabotaging your own self-improvement in order to give yourself something to complain about for shallow online sympathy.\n\nHere's my advice: Tomorrow you're going to prepare and eat three healthy meals and that's it. No snacking, no desserts, no sugary or alcoholic drinks. And you're not going to count calories or carefully measure stuff, you're just going to prepare three meals that are healthy made of healthy ingredients, and eat them while thinking about something else. Then you're going to go outside and walk for at least 30 minutes. And you're not going to consult astrological anything. And if you fail to do any of these, you're not going to post about it- at most, you're only going to post the things you *succeed* at. If you feel like posting the bad stuff, spend that time reading a book instead.\n\nAre you ready to do all that? You're still young enough to make meaningful changes. I just gave you an easy 1-day recipe for how to improve, even just a bit. 24 hours of following that recipe instead of all your bad habits. What do you have to lose?",

You find protection from the elements and sit outside just listening to and watching the rain.  The distant lightning.  It's too far to hurt you.  In fact in this moment, nothing seems like it could ever hurt you, with her by your side.  You just listen in silence.  It's an easy silence.  A comfortable silence.  It's not a silence that's begging to be broken, one that is caused by and continued by lack of knowing what to say.  It's a peaceful silence.  Your skin is chilled underneath your hoody, but not so much to drive you inside.  An hour passes.  Occasionally the silence is penetrated by fun conversation.  Maybe a chat about the beauty of nature.  You don't know the ugliness of it.  I mean you do, in an abstract sense.  Lions viciously ripping out babies from wombs, bedbugs forcibly inseminating females, all kinds of natural oddities.  But you don't know the *real* ugliness of nature.  The ugliness that condemns people, for whatever the reason, physical or psychological, to loneliness for the entirety of their life.  You don't know first-hand the brutality of human nature, it's selfishness.  Not with her next to you.  With her, whatever troubles the world has had in perpetuity either don't matter in the grand scheme of things, or will be sorted out in time.  \n\nThe Sun's long been gone, it's nearing 9 now.  You both head inside, cuddle under a cozy blanket, and put on your show.  You haven't watched it together since last weekend.  Some snacks.  Some laughter.  Some teasing.  Some kissing.  That job wore you down all week.  It's worn you down for a lot of weeks.  It wore you down like your childhood did.  Your adolescence.  Early adulthood.  But eventually, you two met, and it gave you more motivation to do more.  You caught your stride finally, and this time didn't slip.  When you almost did, she caught you and you carried on.  Now you have a nice house, a nice evening, a nice woman, and finally, after all this time, some nice thoughts.  Finally, a nice life.  ",

Plan to go out a few more times with her over the course of a month or two so we know each other well and i can make a relationship blossom, going out with her felt soooo good i could spend days talking with her about our passions and views on the world.\n\nI Invited her to a movie i planned to see with another friend of mine, it goes well and she plays into the group dynamic. And then it all goes bad, weeks passes by and i see from my friend's story both of them outside, when i confront him as to why he didn't invite me as well he gives me fake excuses and turns out they did go together a few times without me.\n\nI talked with her at lunch break today and she just said that they were dating and she thanked me for introducing him to me. She said that she liked him a lot and that she liked me too but that it would be awkward to either go out with me while she's dating my bestfriend and that it'd be weird if i was in the middle of their group while hanging out. She said sorry for leaving me out like that and said that we could still speak over the phone or talk at work, she said that i was a \"rare guy to meet with rare qualities and a unique presence\" she said that she understood how well my friend and i are matching our energies (him being a very impulsive and energetic boy while im a calmer but always open to anything man) but she still dates my friend and not me. I know it's not healthy to stay in contact with someone you feel strong emotions with but can't reach, i don't know what to do now, i'll just step back and retreat in silence.\n\nI don't know what to feel anymore now, it's not the first time it goes well with someone before it suddenly falls down. I don't know why im never a priority even if im a rare man with rare qualities. It always happens to others, i've yet to experience this pleasure too. I have to fight everyday just to get what others people have by just living normally. Companionship is a need, i want to have intimacy with a girl, i want to sleep in the same bed as her i, i want to hug and kiss her, i want to protect her, give her gifts, do anything for this hypothetical lady to be happy. I don't know anymore what im missing, im cursing every thing that made me. Im sick of spending days alone not uttering a single word. I workes on myself for years to bypass awkward talks, i attended events, joined clubs, talked with people. I took skincare, worked out, learnt how to style my clothes, learnt to dress myself, i have hobbies, i have an academic background, what do i lack i followed everything right, i always was virtuous and an honest man.\n\nI wish to disappear into fine dust, if i have to live a life of silence i'd rather be a loud memory.\n\nThere's not much to say or comment here but just laying out what i feel and writing it knowing it'll be read by at least one person makes me feel more at ease so thank you for reading it",

Even men's movements ridicule such men. The common denominator of insults for a man across the board is ridiculing his perceived lack of experience in romance or dating.\n\nContrary to popular stereotypes of men who are inexperienced in dating or serious relationships, most of us are normal people who just weren't lucky in Romance. We aren't some dysfunctional sociopaths or political extremists.\n\nI'm a 31 year old male, had two short flings before, but never had a long term relationships. My close friends know this, but I lie to everyone else about my relationship status, saying either I got off a long term relationship or I'm working on one. Heck, even some paperwork nowadays ask reasons if the box \"never married\" is ticked. I feel like if my secret ever gets out, I'd be ridiculed, considered borderline dysfunctional & even look apprehensive to some.\n\nI don't expect society to tell that we're okay, I guess I won't hear that in my life time. All that I hope is that if people were less judgmental of older adults, especially men, who aren't married or have little to no dating experience. Society tells us that it isn't a race & everyone's experience is unique, but that same society would raise eyebrows if you don't have something going on for you at a certain age.\n\nIf you're not a Forever Alone person reading this, please be kinder to people like us. We are not stagnated, we are improving ourselves everyday, most of us are good people. Treat us just like any person else. Before we find love, we'd love to be seen as human first.\n\n",

I floated the idea of dating a man who really hadn't been in a relationship and we were 29-30 at the time and even though I saw red flags:\n\n* he lived with his family\n* had never had a full-time job seemingly by choice\n* every time we kinda sorta talked about the future as a couple it always seemed to include me basically being the one who works\n* always attempting to armchair diagnose me (psychology undergrad)\n* talked about sex that made me feel like I \"owed\" him sex because my ex before him was abusive and if I fucked the ex I should fuck him\n\n\\[...and even though I saw red flags\\] I wanted to give the benefit of the doubt? This guy had never been in a relationship. Was a virgin. I didn't view him with suspicion or disdain but it was his actions and attitude and lack of self-motivation that eventually made me change my mind to dating him. I wasn't lonely enough to deal with that.\n\n>I'm a 31 year old male, had two short flings before, but never had a long term relationships. My close friends know this, but I lie to everyone else about my relationship status, saying either I got off a long term relationship or I'm working on one.\n\nI worry that saying you just got out of a long term relationship will hinder prospects. If I have an interest in a guy and he tells me he just got out of a long-term relationship I immediately put up a barrier because I don't want to end up being the rebound. If a guy I just met and maybe feel a little into tells me that he's working on a relationship I immediately friend-zone them because I'm not about to get in the middle of that.\n\nYou're 31 -- still young! I'm so happy to hear you're improving yourself and I truly hope you can find someone to share your time with. I know it's cliche but FOR ME weight and looks don't matter. I have dated a man who I was not physically attracted to because he was just an awesome and hilarious person and the only reason we broke up was because he wanted to take it to the next level (he was saying \"I love you\") and I wasn't at a point in my life where I felt I could (I wasn't able to say \"I love you\" and he wasn't able to give me time). That dude is married now and I firmly believe his wife makes him happier than I ever could have so it really worked out for him.\n\nYou're human and you matter, and our biggest critic is always ourselves.",

I'm open to a connection but romantic at this time with you is not something I feel interested in.\"\n\nAnd my spirit is crushed. I'm so tired of \"dating\". It just feels like such a waste of energy and effort. I guess I'm bad at reading social cues because I was flirting with her and she seemed to be reacting positively to it.\n\nThe past few attempts to date/relationships I've been have been so hard on me. She was the first girl who didn't make me feel like I was ignoring red flags after the fact.\n\nAnd all this was right after I spent the weekend at a music festival with a bunch of friends, who are of course all couples which just made it hit so much harder. I just want to feel wanted. I want someone to see in me what I do.",

He has the most subscribers on there for his niche at around 210K. I was a little nervous about how the video calls/discussion would go from the beginning and also during. After the video call, he was impressed by how I was able to speak which to me was hard to believe.\n\nThis was hard for me to believe because like many of us on here in my decades of living in this doggone Earth, I still don’t have luck with women like I’ve been promised I would have. I can get dates and meet people however rarely any of the dates I’ve gone on they have an interest in wanting to see or talk to me again, and none of it has led to a relationship from me as I end up getting ghosted or turned it down at some point. Also, I hardly have any friends and all those friends really was the result of luck rather than me being an outgoing person, knowing how to talk to people or just being friendly, and having the good traits I’ve been always taught to have. \n\nThis moment was a sure fire reminder that I feel like nearly anyone in general do not like me enough to have a connection or a relationship with me. I don’t feel like I’m a bad conversationalist and other people have told me that I converse in a good way or better than I thought. I also try to be friendly, considerate as much as I can, and make people laugh, and if I’ve tried demonstrating those traits to dozens of women over the past decade and not ONE had enough interest, I really don’t know what to do besides hope that I have some kind of luck. \n\n",

I may have these good qualities, but one of the big challenges is that there are fewer opportunities for me than they were before to meet women.

Imagine a group of hungry people starving to death, sitting outside a restaurant, being prevented by police from going in. Eventually they let one guy in, so he enters and eats and eats and eats till he's almost sick, and literally cannot get another morsel into his mouth, and feels sick just looking at the food. He then comes out and tells everyone else, I dunno what you guys are obsessing over, honestly it's not all that, I feel sick looking at the food now...\n\nYou get the analogy. \n\nThese people are selfish ignoramuses. \n\nMore than being insensitive, it's completely stupid. Another angle they seem to approach is that because the excitement and romance whittles down after a few months, it somehow renders the initial period of excitement and romance as worthless. That is completely stupidity. No pleasure in this life is perpetual, does that take away from the value of the experience? Why go out to eat at expensive places instead of always eating at home? Why go on holidays instead of just staying at home? Because the experience itself has value, even if it's not temporary. \n\nI'm sick of these people honestly. ",

I also found it easier to not even try, it’s like after being bullied I gave up at like 12-13. Now I am at a social/emotional maturity level where I could make friends and socialize a little better… if I was still 18. This level is still behind my age group. Getting close to my late 20’s, literally everybody is now married, having kids or at least in a relationship, and have their own friend groups and friends. They have 0 interest in getting to know me. Nobody initiates at all anymore, it’s always me who has to try and endure ghosting, uninterested one word replies or hostility. It’s like nobody  cares at this age if you haven’t been in their social group/network for ages. I am rejected by society at this point. Can’t even land a job anymore. Dating, jobs, friends it’s all the same.\n\nAlthough tbh, this issue was already a thing when I went to college, I thought it was gonna be my big comeback moment but everybody was already in pre-formed cliques and groups and surprisingly weren’t open at all to making friends with me since I wasn’t part of their pre-formed network so they ignored me. High school years was the last time when I should have formed social networks. If you have’t done it by your late teens it’s gonna be impossible to catch up and “break into” established groups. Can’t even do it to my remaining friend’s group, let alone to strangers. And the weirdest thing is I have never seen anyone like me irl, nobody was the lones friendless loser, even shy guys had girlfriends and supportive friends by their late teens.",

The stress made my hair gray at 17 and to add salt to the wound, I developed a swallowing disorder at the same time of my depression so I couldn't eat solid foods. This also didn't help cuz I was poor too, so it was a pretty fucked up situation.\n\nMy fear of swallowing lasted for 3 whole years, I don't know if you can imagine this, but not being able to eat food for 3 years that too while battling depression and anxiety is pretty fucking tiring and you just want to end it all. But I somehow went on with it. I used the internet to help me with my depression and eating disorder cuz I couldn't afford therapy. I started earning some money through freelancing as well at the same time. I used the money to go the gym and afford a good diet. And gradually, I managed my swallowing issues and mental health problems and consequently my physical health also started to improve. \n\nRight now I am almost 23, mentally sound, with a good lean physique, and people compliment me often about how I look, so it's been quite a turnaround for me. But it took some will to unfuck all that.",

It doesn’t matter whether it’s friendship or potential relationships, it almost always ends the same way. \n\nI haven’t made a new irl friend in several years. I’m autistic and I have a flat affect, which makes people think I’m cold and unfriendly. I’m polite, but most people my age automatically dislike me for my lack of facial expressions and flat voice. Old people tend to like me much more. \n\nWhen I have forced myself to mask and show emotions, people thought I was being insincere. The IRL friends I made before all gradually drifted from me and now I’m in touch with none of them more than once a year.\n\nInstead, all I have are the handful of people I met on Discord that didn’t ghost me within a few days or months. We text multiple times a week and I like them, but the closest ones live three hours away and purely interacting online doesn’t really satisfy my need to socialize. Sometimes I join “friend making” servers to meet more people, but all of those people ghost super quickly (even the ones that add me first). I’d think it has something to do with me, but I’ve had multiple online friends say I was a nice person and a good texter.\n\nDating hasn’t been any better. Anyone who has shown interest in me changed their mind because I was either too oblivious until it was too late or I made a social mistake I didn’t notice that made them abruptly change their mind. I joined a few dating apps, but I’m in a somewhat rural area and since I’m nonbinary I went through all of the profiles on both apps available to me in less than a week. I got one like that I wasn’t into and then one match that I ended up having zero chemistry with. I am now 23 and I haven’t even had my first kiss.\n\nI always see people on Reddit suggest the Meetup app for meeting people, but both in the big city I used to live in and the somewhat rural area I live in now the app is basically dead and the few events on there barely have any attendees (and they’re all 30+ years older than me).\n\nThe other “solution” I always see made online is to go to third places to potentially meet people, which I already do. Every day for the past year I’ve gone to a coffee shop and then the library to hang out for a while. No one ever strikes up a conversation with me and just looking at people my own age and walking in their general direction makes them say “piss off.” Even out here in the middle of nowhere Oregon, the Seattle Freeze is still in effect.\n\nTo everyone in my life outside my family I’m either just a person from school that they have nothing in common with anymore, or “Neb,” the internet stranger that’s sometimes fun to message. That’s all I am to people.",

It will be really healthy for you. I am single as well and balding but I spent some time with women the past two years and it has done wonders for my self-esteem. Still single but not angry or sad. Never worry about the past experiences as a device to tear you down. Relationships are teams and teams are communities. We need people of all shapes, sizes, classes, wealth, attraction, intellect. You just don't know. Some people prefer less experience. My old college friend's father never had sex or a relationship till he met his wife around 30 (I think 33).  His wife got around and-all but when she met him and learned he was a virgin she found it humbling and fell in love with him.\n\nJust saying, relax man. Women want you, they just don't Brad Pitt want you.",

Started balding at around 12,was a NW3.5 by 14. Balding so aggressively at that age, you can see how I would get no positive attention from the opposite gender, right? And balding that young killed my self confidence in the context of relationships. Well now I'm nearing the end of college, still don't know one single guy that's balding and in a relationship. For balding to become acceptable for women, it's like 25 years and up.\n\nSure I could just wait for that filter to die out by then, but because of that which I couldn't control since 12 years old, I feel extremely behind socially, and it hurts.

You will only be happy when you don't give a shit about what other people think about your hair and you just expect them to accept you as you are and consider them not worth your time if they don't. Shave it all off and stand proud.\n\nIf you are insecure enough it is still bothering you (and it is absolutely damaging to be different at a young age, i get that) then far better to spend that money on therapy. \n\nRe the 'what's in it for you', I didn't mean that as something you personally do now, just something to watch you aren't doing in future as it seems really common and its damaging. \n\nIf you interact with everyone just as (you may be a potential girlfriend for me)  or (you may be a potential best friend for me),which is a natural thing to do if you are lonely and want those things,  then people will sense that and its the worse thing you can do. \n\nApproach the world on the basis that you are trying to be nice to people and open and friendly because you are a nice person and it's as the right thing to do. Be interested in other people because you care with no other expectation or demand. Make the effort to keep in contact with people - what happened to your friends from school? Text them and then put effort into maintaining those relationships, it's doesn't happen without work.\n\nConfidence is attractive, insecurity is not. Having an insecure friend or boyfriend puts an instant burden on a relationship because it demands constant reassurance and support which can be exhausting,  so it puts people off if they sense you are insecure or desperate. \n\nFix your insecurity by accepting yourself as you are (not easy, hence therapy)  and being someone who deserves friendship and love because you treat people in your life decently just because you are a decent person,  and life will be much easier.",

                        "comment": "Your first paragraph. I was doing that. For 3 years, shaving my head, and believing that people who judge me are not worth my time. Standing proud even when told that my bald head looks like shit. I'm not lying, I was told that by strangers and friends. It might sound like I'm just lying, that can't be true, but I'm 100% being real with you. And guess what? Nothing changed, I just got even less chances than I usually get. People were just so much more judgemental, everyone.\n\nSo I realized, doesn't matter how much I respect myself and believe it doesn't matter, it does matter. I was so insecure, I realized that is a big problem, I became comfortable with myself, and then actually managed to absolutely not be insecure for 3 years. Absolutely fine with myself, openminded, respectful, fine with being bald, shaving my head, gym, everything. But those 3 years taught me that I actually should go back to being insecure.\n\nAnd here I am again. Fixing myself and being fixed in the insecurity context for 3 years did absolutely nothing, made it even worse since I was fully bald. What I'm saying sounds absolutely insane and cognitively distorted, but I'm being so real right now. That is literally what happened. One of my friends didn't miss a chance to tell me to regrow my balding hair, since in his words, in a genuinely concerned tone: \"Please regrow your hair, you absolutely don't look good bald, it's not for you\". While the same person told me to go bald in the first place, since my hair looks like shit. And he wasn't the only person, so many people told me to just shave it and be done with it, and then when I did, the look on their faces, of pure horror, and telling me to just grow it back out. As also one of my roommates said it: \"Bro your hairline looked like you had a penis on your head, but now when you shaved, YOU look like shit.\" (This sentence wasn't said in English, so in this case, penis and shit rhymed, it was a funny joke to him, he said it in front of other people, men and women, they all laughed). There was also this girl that I became friends with online, but when she saw me in real life, that I was bald, dude, she instantly stopped any interactions that were happening with me. Like what the actual fuck.\n\nAnd once again, I don't interact with people with a prejudice context of \"a potential partner\". I've never even had a female friend, so just being a friend with that person is enough for me. Just having a genuine connection with someone is enough for my starved self. People are amazing, I love seeing the weird personalities of others. Were all human. My attraction is based mainly on personality. No joke.\n\nSince I fixed my insecurity and was thrown back into it because of my environment and circumstance, you really think spending time and money on the cope of therapy would be a better investment than just fixing the root cause? You think the world is fair? And also with your final paragraph, thinking that I'm not a person that treats others decently? \"Since he's alone, he must be a flawed and bad person\". You never said that explicitly, but by saying that by me treating others decently, life would be easier, you implied it, since I have no connections really with others. I don't know what to say man. I wish the world was fair, but from my lived experience, no matter what I did, it's just not fair.\n\nIt’s true that confidence is important, but it’s also true that the world can be unfair and judgmental. The real question is what approach will bring the most satisfaction and well-being to the person struggling with this issue. And keep in mind, I already did a lot you're recommending.\n\nAnd fuck it, here is my hair at 15 (https://ibb.co/BFGMC4m).",

AIs are just large language models that predict sensible sounding answers to a prompt. It doesn’t have a clue whether or not it is correct, just that it sounds right. There’s a story of a German crime reporter that was constantly being accused of crimes by chatGPT because the connection between his name and crimes made sense. That’s what these models do, they’ve lots of information on badly taken pictures of men who say that they’re ugly, so now the connection between a badly taken picture of a man and a text of being ugly makes sense to the AI. I wouldn’t put much stock into it.",

Saying I was good for bringing money in but too ugly and fat. 16 years of it… It left scars. Lots of them. I know now it was abuse. But when you meet someone at 17, have kids with them and they start treating you that way…you start to believe it’s normal. \n\nI ended up leaving. He said I would never find anyone else. 14 years later I do realize he was right.. I don’t know what real love is. I see it happening for others but not for me. I’m terrified of men. I’ve done the therapy, the meds, the self work…. Lost 100 pounds.. you name it.. \nI can handle being single but what I really miss right now is sleeping next to someone.. you know that safe and peaceful feeling of just being safely in your most vulnerable state?

                "text_body": "*Every day I wake up, then I start to break up...*\n\n  \nJust for clarification - I'm writing this after 10 hour night shift in my country, and English is not my first language. \n\n  \nAnyway, I feel empty inside for long time. I'm right now at the end of my studies... Went all without love. And you know what's worst? The thing that I was in love once. \n\nThe story begins before the university. I knew a girl, who cheated on me. That's the important part - and the fact that her new boyfriend had to brag about \"stealing my girlfriend\" on my DMs. \n\nWent to the university in diffrent city, hoping to find someone. Was there not enough stories about loser who goes to new place and finds his love? Five years later - this is not one of this stories. Because of being desperate, I pushed people away from me. I was acting pathetic and honestly? I would stay away from myself. However, I just want to put emphasis on the fact, that I'm NOT the same guy as five years ago. I'm not acting all \"I'm so sad, so miserable\" (and yes, I know the fact that this post goes against this). \n\nI think the worst part is that I know that it's not them, not \"being misunderstood\". The blame is on me, the burden is mine to bear - that it was me, who pushed away any chances. And who lost. \n\nBut well, I didn't give up. Had to survive, being a coward. Yes, a coward, because It's not hope, it's fear that kept me still. Fear of death, of making the last straw... Call it however you want. Mind that it was pandemic, and I was literally locked up. \n\nSo I started looking for people. After all, that's the advice everyone will give you, right? Dating apps are biased (and with my face being the 100% working anticonecption, I had no hope. i tried them, so it's not just \"it would end that way!\"), so the best is to have a hobby and go there, to find someone who will love you, and the pasion will join you two!\n\nYeah, sure. Here's a list:\n\n\\- I playe TTRPGs. Joined a server four years ago, with our community recruited in a way \"I know a guy who wants to play\". Guess who's still alone. \n\n\\- I play video games. I'm on a server from one game I really like. Guess what. \n\n\\- I joined a students organisation focused on integration - basiclly we meet for once for roughly two weeks and drink alcohol, sing shanties... Not a parties, mind you. More like \"a group of colleagues goes out\" is best description. \n\n\\- I like to read books. So started a small book club. \n\nAnd I want to tell you one important thing, why fate decided that I'm gonna stay forever alone. \n\nWhen there's a girl in one of the higher groups... She has someone. A boyfriend, a fiance, a husband. Of course, not every girl. \n\nOf course it's not every case. There are girls who are single. They are lesbian.\n\nThat's the 100% girls who I meet in these spaces. And ending my studies, I feel like my options are ending. Yes, there is work... \n\nBut being a night creature I am, I will be looking for Night Shift. That usually are single employee.\n\nAnd now, what's the most burdening thing? I'm still a virgin. Yes, I know, sex is not that awesome, it will be bad, because every first time is bad, it's not the most definig thing in your life...\n\nThey're just telling a hungry man that food is not important and it will taste bad. A metaphor for me, but can you really tell in our culture \"you should not want to have sex once\"? And yes, I know about sex workers. It's just... It doesn't feel the same in my mind. I put the diffrence between sex with someone who loves you and paying someone for sex.  \n\nAnd I'm afraid. Because I don't want to become a wizard. \n\nAmong my friends I am know as the \"clown\", \"the jester\", \"the meme professor\". And yes, I tell jokes about being a wizard, about the right hand. And yes, they laugh with me. \n\nBut then comes a nights like this one - where I feel like a nobody. Like I could disappear and they wouldn't even notice. The family and pressure do not help, but this is not this kind of sub. It's just that I feel like the funny kid when I come back to my home, or sit in work when nothing happens. And start thinking, how my bed will stay cold. How I can't even hug anybody with romantic feelings.  How I am alone in all of this. How even if there is a girl, I lose headstart. Because I have some kind of honor - I'm not going after taken girls. \n\nAnd worst? How I tasted this. How I know what it feels to be loved. How it feels to be important to someone and knowing someone is important to you. How it feels to kiss. \n\nI miss this feelings. \n\nA question that will forever remains - is it better to stay in the unknown, never knowing how it is being loved? Or is it better to taste this, and then never more?\n\nTo end this in a bit positive note, I will quote a comment I once read on youtube under doomer mix. Yes, I listened to them. Yes, I was going on nightwalks. Yes, I was... And I still am a doomer. And yes, the comment is cheesy and stupid... But I like it.\n\n  \n*We all live all our tragedies alone, but at least we're together.* ",

Wow. 4 months into her first relationship.. hearing it from a women's perspective is so reassuring and comforting in a way. This gives me hope. Heartbreaking to hear the priority list though of being husband/wife/boyfriend, then kids and then only when they have energy, its us but they are likely to say no. Absolutely soul shattering and it made me think of a lot of people in my life who have had no time for me because they are spending the day with their partner, going away on the weekend with their partner, engagement announcements or hearing coworkers talk about first times and kissing people in the club. It all seems so foreign to me.",

Well, needless to say, despite my best efforts to think too much into it and despite her telling me that she isn't currently looking for a boyfriend I still got my hopes up. It is ridiculous. Anyways, we studied together for a while, which was honestly nice and at some point we kinda faded away lol. \n\n2. This year I met a woman at work place. Kind of happened \"accidentally\". Felt like we are getting along well. Again, despite me telling myself years ago to not get my hopes up I still did. Today I finally reached to the conclusion that there is truly nothing going on between us.\n\nIn conclusion. It is crazy to me how a nice gesture from a woman I find attractive can immediately shoot my hopes up, no matter how much I tell myself that I am not husband material. No matter how often I tell myself that she is just being friendly or nice. \n\nWhy does this happen? \n\nOn the other hand, I see that hope is truly an amazing and strong thing. It is truly strong. If I could only focus my hope in the right areas of my life. Maybe I would have been already successful or smth. \n\nAm still stuck in the *wanting to marry* phase no matter what I do. At least I did realize that I use p0rn to rather drown these feelings instead of actually dealing with them. Time heals. I just have to *suffer* through these emotions. It'll get better.

And you don’t have the cushioning excuse of “well shit, she’s involved with someone already, that’s a valid reason to tell me to gtfo. Good for her for staying fully committed to her partner”. She might be actively dating or wishing for a man to appear and show her a lovely time, she simply isn’t interested in you whatsoever and it’s only because of you, as an individual, you simply don’t impress or entice her in the slightest and she is not interested in you because you as a human man do not make her want to reciprocate your interest. And that sucks big time, it’s the kind of feeling that makes FA dudes like myself paranoid about showing interest in women anywhere. At least them having a boyfriend or husband is a quick, cut-and-shut valid reason to stop and abandon hope. I still prefer it to basically being told that I’m not a good enough human male.\n\nAlthough I can’t speak regarding your mention of attractive YouTubers having boyfriends, I may have only been fixated on a certain experience",

My parents never loved me and pretty much beat me my whole life. The only good moments i remember were from before 5. I just kind of miss being a kid no one hated, loved unconditionally and hugged. \n\nOnce I started elementary school, teachers didn't like me and did the most to move me away from my friends. At 7, I got an actual knife pulled on me. I got sex*ally assaulted. I forgive who assaulted me because they didn't physically hurt me. But at the same time, what the f*ck. In that same year, I also almost drowned 2 times and no one did anything. Not even asking me if i was fine. \n\nI started attempting s*cide from 8 years old various times. Once again, no one cared. My friends never ever expressed they love me, they insulted me and after like 7 years of friendship they ghosted me. At 11, I started cutting and had depression, no one cared. I told the psychologist and she gave me the fluoride stare. Which is why i never understood how people didn't wanna confess they wanted to d*e at the psychologist, I literally posted everyday i was about to kms on the whatsapp or instagram story and no one cared. Even when i tried hanging myself and had scars no one cared. \n\nI once self harmed super badly because of a mental breakdown and all my parents said was \"don't do that or people will think we beat you\". Not even are you ok. I had psychosis, no one cared.\n\nEveryone I've ever wanted has rejected me or ghosted me. And i'm not even ugly, and i obviously don't tell my mental problems to people, when you're this f*cking insane and unloved you learn early how to be normal. \n\nI've never really had anyone i could talk to and even if i spoke to them all they said was oof. I started antidepressants at 19 secretly bc my mom is against medicine and they didn't even work no matter how we increased the doses i still had meltdowns. I have the emotional capacity of a 3 year old at 20. I am constantly screaming, trying to not hurt myself or break things bc frankly i cant do this anymore. \n\nOn reddit, even when i express who my fav characters are on bitch ass cartoons subreddits i get death threats. I express my fav songs on singer subreddits: death threats. I say all my opinions get downvoted and i get called stupid and insulted to hell for saying the truth. \n\nI am a virgin, never had a bf, never ha d afriend group, job or anything. Trying to not k*** myself is really hard, knowing i'm unloved and i never will be loved. Great stuff. ",

Being a dwarf that is physically limited is also sick for being fat, because you can only eat 1200 calories in a day to lose weight because your base rate is 1800 and you CAN'T MOVE. The only time I've ever gotten attention from women, I have to post in hookup subs with shit like \"ever wanted to fuck a midget? use me for novelty!\" like a freakshow exhibit, and we're at a rate of about 1 per year. Granted, it worked to get laid I suppose, and I realize I'll be a pariah for saying this in here but it didn't mean shit to me. But, as you do with worthless one night stands you regret sleeping with (I guess? I wouldn't), they both cut me right out of their lives pretty much immediately after. One found another guy pretty quick and the other one just blocked me immediately. I don't feel like a man, because I'm not I guess, their treatment of me and the hoops I have to jump through to get a woman to fucking talk to me for more than a day, proves to me I'm not. Nothing I can fucking do to change any of this. The two options are \"Give up\" or \"keep ramming your head into the brick wall until your head or the wall breaks\" and neither of those seem particularly appealing. So I guess I'll just keep doing nothing by sitting here screaming out into the void of the internet, crying myself to sleep, getting up, *and doing it  all. over. again. and again. and again...yay...*",

I'm in decent shape, and the few relationships I've been in have fizzled into nothing quickly. The one thing I can say that has a positive interpretation is that I have seen many examples of men in relationships. Many ugly, many short, many fat, many broke, many deformed, and many straight up evil. While all of those things make dating more difficult, there's always someone willing to look past it in favor of your best qualities.\n\nThe best advice I can give is to maximize your best qualities. Working out can be beneficial both for how others perceive you and for your physical/mental health. Ultimately, I think the most important thing, but the hardest when you feel hopeless, is to put yourself out there anyway and be endearing to talk to. All dating is gambling, and your odds get better the more people you're on good terms with.\n\nI feel weird sharing my thoughts here, as our situations are different and I know how hollow words of encouragement feel when you're hopeless. Hopelessness is what brought me back to this account. I hope this comment wasn't completely useless.",

I know it from my own experiences it's so much easier to say than to be like that but you really need to try to avoid this thoughts because it really pushes you down in a very effective way.\n\nThis is something that requires steadily discipline but every time you think about it stop it immediately and think about something different whatever it will be. It's just important that it's nothing that makes you feel bad. If you don't know anything that fast sing a song in your mind (children songs are also okay) or think about something silly. The main point is just that you have something different in your mind than the thoughts that makes you feel bad in any way so you get trained not to think about it all the time.\n\nI was like you in the past so I know how bad it feels but today I don't have a problem with going to the city on my own and the positive aspect is I can do what I want when I want it. In the meantime I don't even think about how nice it would be if there were a girlfriend with me (what I would clearly prefer) but in the end with thoughs like that you don't change anything, you just screw your own activities and/or time while you already have suffered enough.\n\nBtw, it would be cool if you would upload some photos from the trip on your profile because lots of people are interested in Japan and would enjoy the see them and it would also make you more interesting while in addition it gives others a topic to chat with you.\n\nMy comment is going to large so I make the rest as short as possible:\n\n- You have the right to be proud of you for completing such a trip. It's not easy and requires adultness.\n\n- Your coworkers are as.ho.es. Don't give a shit on their drivel. Japanese women are not only in Japan and you don't need irrelevant sex, you need to be loved so it wouldn't have been what makes you feel better. They just think like that because they're dull.\n\n\n(To be transparent, I also get antidepressants what helps agains my bad thoughs without any doubt so don't make yourself reproach if you have trouble with stopping your negative thinking but trying to avoid the thoughts is also a important part)",

In all social situations I'm overly quiet and only speak when spoken too. If people ask questions, I give vague answers. I pretty much never show emotion. I'm too scared to open up even slightly. And that isn't even half of my mental problems.\n\nIt hurts seeing every other person around me in a relationship. It hurts knowing I passed my high school/college days without a single bit of romantic or sexual experience. It hurts that no woman has ever found me attractive. And it hurts that I don't have the drive to improve myself. People say to be confident, but there's nothing about myself that warrants confidence. I know people say that you have to love yourself before loving someone else, but it feels like you shouldn't love yourself if nobody else can.\n\nI just wish I got to experience what having a relationship was like, even if it was just once.

I know people say that you have to love yourself before loving someone else, but it feels like you shouldn't love yourself if nobody else can.\n\nI used to feel the same way. Then I did all the self-improvement mumbo-jumbo, made sure I started 'checking all the boxes' so to speak, and things changed. It didn't improve my dating life much at first, although it did lead to people in general treating me better. Anyway, what it did prove to me is that I'm not necessarily the problem. I'm the best I can be, and I even have objective evidence proving it such as having above average income and a healthy weight. I'm no underwear model, but I'm also not grossly deformed. There's nothing wrong with me. The problem is not that I am no good, the problem is that other people (in particular women who I find attractive) aren't seeing the good in me.\n\nAnd so I gained confidence in myself. My self-esteem much improved. I stopped needing the validation of others because I had objective measures I was meeting, and I had the knowledge that I had made my best effort to be my best self. Effort other people can't see, of course, since it's all behind the scenes. I love myself *because* I deserve to be loved. I love myself *because* nobody else will. Now, getting others to see the good in me that I know is there? Entirely different problem from not being good enough. Sure, you can improve your 'marketing' to some extent -- get better dating app photos, iteratively improve your fashion and experiment with style, etc. -- but by and large it unfortunately comes down to luck. You can't force attraction, you can't make other people give you a chance. All you can do is keep trying, keep putting yourself out there, until you happen upon the right person or tribe. That's how socialization works.\n\nYou're 29. I wasted my teens and 20's chasing an education and career path that to this day has been pretty fruitless. (I was sold the lie that \"STEM\" was a guarantee of prosperity. Only some fields are, especially big tech.) I didn't go on my first date until 32, didn't get laid till 34, and as I'm pushing 40 now only finally received the coveted relationship labels a couple weeks ago. You're still young enough to make things happen, as astonishing as that might sound. But you have to make an effort to improve on your mental issues. Maybe that involves therapy, maybe you simply need to introspect and power through your fears. Become the best version of yourself that you can. And then eventually you need to get lucky, but the vast majority of people obviously do at some point. It's just a matter of putting yourself in a position where getting lucky is possible, and that position isn't being overly quiet and closed off to people trying to get to know you.\n\nAlso, not to step on the toes of my motivational speech (if you want to call it that), but worst case scenario is you accept your station in life and make the best of what else life has to offer. Regardless, I wish you the best of luck.",

Hundreds of Harvard students volunteered and hundred of men from Boston's harder neighborhoods volunteered.\n\nAfter decades of annual reporting it was clear. Money has nothing to do with happiness.

It is a necessity.\n\nThe Harvard Study goes further.

If I was in their shoes I would definitely take action such as lawsuit, getting some benefits, etc. But I still think that holding resentment over what happened is counterproductive.\n\n>You shouldn't feel like you're carrying the weight, but that doesn't change the fact that you are in fact carrying the weight\n\nI would have to agree with you here. A lot of things are dependent on other people's choices, and there's no way around that. It's more about trying to make the ride along smoother, as much as you can.\n\n>No one here can say that they've truly done their best, that they've taken every possible measure to find connection.\n\nIt would be the ideal case.

The people who have high status often inherited it because their family was already known, or they are costing on a decades old reputation from their youth. A lot of small towns aren't going to be big enough to host different communities or subcultures either so if you are in any way different you are going to have a hell of a time. You HAVE to vote a certain way, practice a certain religion, like the right kind of music, etc.",

People with large, well-adjusted social circles usually have all the traits necessary to make find a relationship pretty easy - so they find people to settle down with in their early/mid 20s and then don't have to worry about it. And if they are single, they have these large social circles where finding someone is not difficult if the connections are good. Those of us who are chronically single tend to be the opposite - we have small to nonexistent social circles, usually with people like us. It's the blind leading the blind. And it's often too late for us to learn the skills necessary to build social circles from scratch - most people master these skills by the time they leave high school.",

And she was right, and she helped encourage me to get back into trying to date after I got better. I built confidence back up, and she made me feel pretty good for a good while. \n\nIt definitely depends on the therapist though. I had a different one after a second accident with my brain, and the second one was pretty not good I felt. So, give it a try.

                "text_body": "I’m a 34-year-old man, and in my life, I’ve only had one relationship. Strangely, I felt lonelier in that relationship than I ever did alone. Before we got together, we were friends—and during that time, I didn’t feel lonely. But the closer we became, the more we changed, and the more isolated I felt. That relationship came with many negative emotions.\n\nIn the early stages, I blamed myself for everything—even when she lashed out at me. I told myself I had no experience with relationships, that I didn’t understand how they worked, and that it was all my fault. I thought, “If I just change, things will get better.” Instead of walking away, I dug in deeper—far too deep. I felt desperately lonely, and this seemed like my only chance at a relationship. Despite all the red flags and clear signs that it wasn’t going to work, I kept pushing through because I didn’t want to be alone.\n\nI remember feeling intense jealousy in the evenings, walking by myself and seeing couples out together—laughing, chatting, just being. For them, it all seemed so natural. Relationships looked easy, like second nature. But not for me.\n\nOne of the hardest things to accept is that I’m massively unattractive. My recent Tinder experience says it all: 12,000 right swipes, 21 matches. Out of those 21, at least half didn’t even reply. I could hardly believe I had swiped that many times—but that's what the stats showed.\n\nOn top of that, I struggle with social anxiety. My communication skills often feel like those of an alien who just landed on Earth—clueless about how to talk to people or fit in.\n\nThis post isn’t just to vent or cry. I’m always working to improve myself. In fact, after the breakup, my mental health began to improve. I’ve been making an effort to talk to more people and have joined some local groups. I still often feel lonely and misunderstood in those spaces—not many people can relate to what it’s like to struggle this much with basic communication—but I’m trying. As I get older, I’m learning to appreciate life more. I know I have to keep trying, and maybe, one day, I’ll meet people I can truly connect with.\n\nSo, if you’re lonely and find yourself in a relationship just because it’s an opportunity—please think carefully. Watch for red flags early. Don’t go as far as having a child with someone when the foundation of the relationship is already built on strange, often frightening arguments.\n\nIt’s tough, though. Honestly, if someone had tried to warn me back then, I probably would’ve just gotten defensive—stubborn like a ram—and kept going anyway. Still, that relationship taught me a lot about recognizing warning signs and understanding what relationships should and shouldn’t be.\n\nOf course, I’d love to find a soulmate—someone who understands what it’s like to struggle with communication, maybe even someone going through something similar. Being a foreigner in the UK makes it even harder to feel like I belong. Though that’s not the main issue—the core of it is my difficulty connecting with people.\n\nI’m not going to lie—part of the reason I’m writing this is the hope that maybe, just maybe, there’s a lost soul out there like me. Someone who struggles with the same kind of social anxiety, who might read this and feel seen. And maybe, in some dream-like way, I’d receive a message that says:  \n  \n\"Let's go, our paths align. I can relate. I am an alien too. We'll figure it out together.\"\n\nOf course, I know I’m exaggerating a little with the words…  \nBut still—this is my dream.  \n",

                "text_body": "I’ve been single for over 12 years. Not because I’ve been hurt or disappointed — but simply because I had other priorities. After my first relationship at 18 (which lasted two years and felt more like a societal checkbox than anything deeply emotional), I focused on my studies, student jobs, and later, my career. I told myself that love — whatever that meant — would come “later.”\n\nAnd for more than a decade, nothing happened. I didn’t look, I didn’t feel like I was missing out, I was content. That changed in 2024 when I met someone through work. We weren’t together — nothing happened between us — but I genuinely felt something for the first time in my adult life. I felt love. I felt like a better version of myself around her. I imagined a future. And when I realized that this wouldn’t go anywhere, I found myself… torn.\n\nOn one hand, I now want to share my life with someone, because I’ve had a glimpse of what that can feel like. On the other hand, I find everything around the idea of looking for love incredibly hypocritical and alienating. Let me explain.\n\n1) The dating culture and apps feel fundamentally inauthentic.\n\nApps like Tinder reduce people to commodities — swiping left and right based on looks, like flipping through a catalogue. They’re built on animal impulses: you feel desire, you match, you message — and maybe, you hope, something meaningful will emerge. But how can something deep grow out of something that started on such a shallow foundation?\n\n2) Even “natural” dating advice feels fake to me.\n\nPeople often say: “Just go out, meet people, smile, approach someone who seems interesting…” But again, it’s all built on the same physical impulse: “Approach her because she’s attractive.” It feels like we’re pretending to build something emotional on a foundation that is purely visual and instinctual. That kind of play-acting — pretending we’re not all trying to game each other into relationships — just doesn’t sit right with me.\n\n3) The only way I’ve ever felt something real was over time.\n\nWhat happened in 2024 wasn’t about a first date, a swipe, or a flirty approach. It was about months of conversations, shared work, stress, laughter, mutual respect. I saw that person in good days and bad ones. And over time, my feelings grew — not because I was looking for love, but because I got to know her. That’s the only context where love has ever felt real to me.\n\nAnd yet, I know this: if I don’t actively do something different, nothing will change. I’ll go another 12 years alone. I’m aware of that. But still, I can’t bring myself to go through the motions of dating the way most people do — because deep down, it feels dishonest. I’m not saying others are wrong for doing it — it just feels wrong for me.\n\nSo yeah… I don’t know what I’m looking for by posting this. Maybe just to articulate the conflict inside me. I want to share my life with someone — not because I feel lonely, but because I now know how much better life can feel with the right person. But I don’t want to chase ghosts or force something that isn’t real.\n\nIf anyone has felt something similar — I’d genuinely love to hear how you navigated this.",

It's like hunger or boredom.  It's a selfish emotion that is designed to spur you towards companionship.   Sometimes it is triggered by a person's appearance, sometimes their wealth, other times if they can just hold a conversation.  But ultimately, the objective of pursuing and fostering this attraction is to find someone that YOU want to be with.\n\nThat's what you're missing.  The whole dating game?  It is in fact a superficial mess and everyone is out to exploit it for their own end.  The fact that you're one of the few people to be aware of this is a good thing, but the fact that you don't want to play the game because you don't like that it is inherently self-serving is holding you back.\n\nDon't be ashamed to be selfish at the start, even with someone you love.  You can worry about her needs after a relationship has been established.  For now just focus on the question, \"do I want to be with her?\"",

Women can also set preferred age ranges in dating apps and will not even be exposed to men that they consider to be the wrong age. I live in Europe and people here seem more tolerant of age gaps than in the US/anglosphere. Besides that, I don't think it's generally a good idea to make your happiness and life fulfillment contingent upon social judgment if it can be at all avoided.\n\nI cannot reasonably predict whether I will have given up by 50, but I have no reason to believe that I will become more attracted to older women with age, because the age range of women I'm attracted to hasn't changed previously, and if it was amenable to change then such change should have manifested by now in accordance with my own aging but it hasn't.",

I don’t feel the age I am - it’s as if I am infantilised, or “youthified” by my lack of romantic experience and not having gone through normal life stages. At times I feel my inner age is more like late 20s / early 30s.\n\nIf I developed a bit more confidence and “game” I could even imagine approaching women in their late 20s (not early 20s - being with someone literally less than half my age would feel weird). For the time being however my problem is I don’t get any signs of interest from women of ANY age. I am sociable and make an effort to start conversations with women I meet in hobby groups, for example, but interactions never lead to anything. They don’t dislike me, they’re just indifferent to me. \n\nA few years ago I started reading about how to cold-approach women in bars. But I haven’t put it into practice. Right now I don’t think it would work because I’m still not comfortable enough in my own skin - I believe my low confidence would show through in my body language and tone. I made a lot of progress in my confidence and mental health last year but then had a relapse which I am struggling to climb out of.\n\nSo, I don’t think I can say for sure that it’s too late for me.

Has the commenting on this post been deactivated, or has the post been removed or shut down and it simply hasn’t been updated yet? Have I been banned from commenting in this particular community? Or are there too many users commenting all at once and the app is bugging out from it?\n\nLiterally every single one of those reasons is a possibility and most have happened to me at some point, but the notification is always the same vague, uninformative “please try again later” (which is useless when it turns out that commenting on said post has been made impossible).

                "text_body": "(28M) I’ve struggled with understanding dating since I was 8. I feel absolutely worthless as a single guy who’s only had a short fling seven years ago. I was awkward and fat in high school; losing 90 lbs from running didn’t do anything for me, I guess bc everyone here partners up by age 21. All I see are people online and in-person are dating or married. I live in a small town of 7000 and can’t move until I save enough for it (moving to NYC). I work out and am pretty lean. I’ve gotten some matches on dating apps and have been called cute and handsome, but I still feel so worthless because I don’t have a relationship. Nothing can replace that. This has become an obsession and has motivated me to eat a lot less to burn off what fat still remains. It’s making me lose sleep and affecting my concentration at work. I just want to feel like I matter to someone on a deep level. I’m so sick of being lonely. This angst is causing heart palpitations. I post about things like this and barely anyone cares. I’m not some gross slob who can’t run a 1/4 mile, I’ve run up to 15 miles. I’m 5’7, which is a little short, but I can also grow a good beard and am funny at times. I’m 150 lbs for reference.\n\nUnderstanding dating is SO much harder than anything I’ve ever tried to do (half marathons, driving for 18 hrs straight, college). It’s like a science that only a preselected elite are allowed to be able to understand. You have to not be fat (got it), but you also need to possess a specific type of personality, l be above 6’0, have five close friends, and be wealthy. It’s so unfair because I’ve done everything I’ve been able to think of to make myself more attractive that I have to power to do right now and am still pushing further with that by dieting rigorously and still working out. Dating apps barely seem to work well for me (probably because of my location in a small town), but it still pains me so much. Will it get easier when I move to NYC assuming I put myself out there, successfully become fully lean, and get a good job there? Can dating work for me if I do everything on my end to make myself more appealing? ",

That’s an improvement on my small town, where there are few single women and nowhere to meet them or even make friends unless you’re a diehard Christian.\n\nI think dating has gotten worse everywhere due to the media in general, social media and the dating apps. But it’s such a diverse city. There isn’t one identity of people there, there are lots of foreign transplants there, too, who likely aren’t the typical go-go-go career-obsessed or perfectionist (in terms of looking for a match) types. Having a high quantity of potential matches and a smorgasbord of places to meet them at is more workable for me than having just a workplace and a few restaurants to go to. And I’m a guy who wants a serious relationship- that’s highly sought after by women there. So is there potential for going through multiple dates without leading anywhere with someone? For sure. But in even a city of 400k, I might never be able to start. There’s still high potential for finding a good match there since there are so many types of people who follow different types of passions there, unlike my small monolithic town in TN and some small and medium cities. Nowhere is inherently great, but NYC is good for me so long as I put in the effort, because there’s so much opportunity",

At the start of high school I got a new room with more privacy and suddenly, without deciding to do so, I found myself watching every day. Within a year porn had become the most important part of my daily routine, I felt that I needed it do handle the ever-growing stress of school. If my access to porn was somehow delayed I felt like pulling my hair out, like a smoker losing it without their smoke break. At the same time I had developed a severe problem with fatigue (on my worst day I fell asleep while walking), along with some other health issues. \n\nAround my 18th birthday I decided that I wanted to stop watching porn, or at least take a break from it. I realized something was wrong when, no matter how many times I decided \"this is the last one\", I couldn't stop watching and had to admit to myself that I was severely addicted. My physical and mental health continued to decline, I tried entering the workforce after high school but soon had to quit my job due to constantly falling asleep, no matter how much I slept. I spent 2-3 years going to sleep specialists and doing every test, but nothing ever turned up. \n\nEventually I tried something new to stop watching porn and, to an extent, it worked. By learning addiction psychology I was able to remove my perceived dependence on porn for things such as stress relief and getting to sleep. A few times I was able to go \\~2 weeks without porn, during this time virtually all of my physical and mental health issues would vanish. I felt like a new person full of energy and confidence, feeling more awake on 3 hours of sleep than I did on 9 hours of sleep after watching porn. \n\nTLDR: I became addicted to porn, causing a variety of mental and physical health issues that ruined my life.",

It makes things difficult when meeting women. I don’t know why, but somewhere between my social anxiety, depression, and ADHD, I’ve developed an abnormally high libido. So, to balance it out, I masturbate and watch porn—it helps lower it, keeps me focused, and gets me doing stuff. Probably do it a little too much sometimes, to the point where it gets irritating.\n\nI also go to a local sauna—not really for sex, more for the girlfriend experience. I’ve been there often enough that it’s kind of comforting, but I don’t need to go in all the time. And I don’t do any kinky stuff—it’s strictly vanilla.\n\nOn the dating side of things… yeah, I’ve been trying for years. No real luck. And honestly, I’m kind of giving up on that whole aspect.\n\nOh, and I also lost my virginity to an escort at 25. No regrets, honestly.\n\nLately, I’ve been looking into swingers clubs. I actually booked an event at Off the Dark in Edinburgh. Memberships are expensive, but a friend told me you can get first-timer tickets pretty cheap, so I figured why not?\nit has made me crave comfort more. I’m very stimulated by touch—so much so that if I go without it for too long, I get cranky, and it just becomes frustrating. Sometimes it’s nice, but sometimes it sucks.\n\nSo, yeah.

With the sexist attitudes and such, there's growing talk about younger and younger people consuming this stuff, and stuff with younger people, typically girls, facing more and more expectations to not only have sex but have more and more violent and aggressive sex earlier and earlier, with more and more reports of young boys thinking it's ok to just randomly start choking girls and trying to violently have sex with them, without seeking consent, and things along those lines. Plus actors being presented with looking in a certain heavily idealized and warped way that isn't attainable for a lot of people easily and can put a lot of pressure when it comes to beauty standards (this can dovetail a lot with broader social media and media and such)\n\nAnd then every now and then I hear stuff about people who seek out more \"normal\" porn of just, like, regular average looking people who don't go out of their way to do things in the particular ways or looking in the particular ways that are \"typical\" of porn these days... but then there's issues with a lot of that sort of stuff one can find online apparently just being basically revenge porn where you can't be sure the individuals all consented to putting that stuff online and it could just be leaked online since apparently a lot of guys are fine with throwing that stuff up online without permission from the other people in the content\n\nHaving read about all that sort of shit, the idea of seeking porn content just never felt like something I wanted to do, it sounded like the sort of thing that has so many different potential issues that go against my personal values. It's not that sexuality in general is some sort of bad thing - there's also conservative arguments against porn from perspectives of purity and controlling sexuality and such, and I don't care for that stuff, it's just a matter of the workers rights concerns, privacy/consent concerns, and the sexist and otherwise problematic attitudes that are apparently common with that sort of stuff these days and for some time now",

Can be read as an online PDF or listened to on youtube. As mentioned I haven't been able to fully quit yet, but EasyPeasy allowed my mind to do a 180, recognize porn for what it is and to remove 90% of my usage.\n\nThe point of the EasyPeasy method is to remove the fear of quitting an addiction. To summarize:\n\nAs an addiction develops, the user begins to experience withdrawal symptoms, as well as the symptoms of dopamine desensitization. These symptoms include everything from sleep issues and fatigue, to loss of stress tolerance and anxiety. These symptoms develop gradually, so the user just blames them on everyday life. The only pause in these symptoms happens during porn use, so the user subconsciously believes that porn is solving some sort of problem such as stress or inability to sleep. The truth is that porn can't solve any of these issues, in fact it was causing them / making them worse.\n\nUsers can quit porn for long enough (\\~ 3 weeks) that dopamine withdrawal ends, but still return to it believing that they are missing something important because of the perceived benefits. EasyPeasy reveals these fallacies for what they are, and allows the user to realize that they are losing nothing by quitting their addiction. For example \"Smoking can't remove the source of stress from your life, but it does add to it by desensitizing your natural stress-tolerance\".\n\nThis was very eye-opening for me a few years ago. Back in high school there were days that I literally sprinted home from the bus stop, just to reach porn a minute faster, believing that I would die from stress without it. There was also a time that I argued with a friend of mine who thought porn should be banned. I genuinely believed that there would be riots and the world would fall apart, people unable to cope with life without porn.",

You have no problem interacting with other people, familiar or not. You say good morning. You say excuse me when trying to move by. You say thank you after recieving help or service. \n\nYou don't speak much. Your try to keep your side of a conversation short and to the point. You prefer it that way so that you don't misinterpret what the other person is saying or miss a critical piece of infomation. Despite the care taken, you always feel like you've said the wrong thing. You analyze conversations aftward, to discern where you went wrong, and what you could do better in the future.\n\nYou are aware of your surroundings. You seem to be on a different wavelength than other people. Nobody takes interest in your interests. Nobody seems to like what you like, or the way you like it. Not music, movies, books, or games. You feel alienated from other people. When others comment on your uniqueness, you don't see it as a compliment. You wonder if life would better if you were a faceless sheep in the herd.\n\nYou are kind. At some point in your childhood, maybe at home, maybe in elementary school, maybe in church, someone told you to always be kind and respect others.You took that to heart without knowing it. You are generous. Your generosity hurts you. Your first instint when asked for something is give it. Even if you don't have that something to give. Even when it leads to you suffering. You don't mean to be this way. There's something deep inside of you, that compels you to help without thinking. It makes you sad, because you never ask anything of anybody. Nobody cares.\n\nYou are lonely. Specifically for love most of all. You desire to be in love and to be love by a woman. More than being taught to be kind and respectful to others, you were taught to be kind and respectful to women above all. It's a core part of you. You don't know when it started. You never paid much attention to it as a child, but now you're a adult, it's a pillar of your life. Yet, you've never had a girlfriend or lover. \n\nYou are friendly. You are courteous. You respect women's spaces. You can hold conversations with women, but there's still a gap you cannot close. No woman desires you. You're missing something. Weren't you given the tools to begin a relationship. You watch other men and couples to learn what you're doing wrong. What you learn is that other men are doing the exact opposite of what you were told. They are not kind, they berate women. They are not calm, they threaten women. They are not respectful, they lay their hands on women without consent. You are perplexed, but what is more perplexing is that women seem to not care. \n\nYou are not stupid. The obvious answer is right in front of you. You must be more like those other men, if you want to find love. You refuse. You will never be like those other men. You would rather die than be like those other men. You don't mean to be this way. There's something deep inside you that compels you. Maybe you're crazy. Maybe you're a narcissis. Maybe you're a fool. Maybe everything you were taught about life and love was a lie. Maybe you deserve to be alone.\n\nAt least you'll know that you never betrayed who you are.",

But \"who I am\" is someone who absolutely **deserves** to rot alone\n\nIt's not about ***deserves*** or not, that's a made up notion that implies there is some divine intervention or prerogative that judges you before you're even born. Some people just get dealt a poor set of cards, and thinking that you somehow \"deserve\" it is doing nothing but willfully making your bad hand of cards *even worse.*",

Something with low stakes where if you aren't feeling anything or if she is an asshole you can just cut it short.\n\n>and don't you need money to look presentable (haircut, clothes, etc.)\n\nHonestly, hygeine is super important. You don't need to always be dressed to the 9s but I think it's important to dress and represent yourself in a way that shows you respect yourself. You don't need to have brand-name clothes to look nice. Jeans and a sweater is fine enough as long as it's not stained or full of holes. Deoderant for scent antipersperant if you sweat a lot is good, but I think too many people really lay on cologne and other scents and it can be a little overwhelming...\n\nIf you wanna take a girl out a lotta shit costs money, everything from movies, restaurants, concerts, etc.\n\nIt's important to find someone who has the same values as you do, which can be really freaking difficult... BUT, that's what the first date or learning about each other is for. That's why I think low-stake first dates are the most important like meeting for coffee so if you end up really disliking her it's super easy to end it and you aren't out dinner money. Movies kinda suck for dates cause you don't talk or learn about each other. Concerts are expensive and I didn't know people look at concerts as dates until this post. Restaurants are great but expensive and if I was dating someone who didn't have a lot of money and was upfront about what they can or can't do I would be understanding (going halvsies on dinner dates if we wanted to do dinner somewhere nice would be something I would suggest as an alternative). You could always cook something at home as dinner instead :)\n\n>Is there even a point in trying to date when you have no disposable income?\n\nThere is if its what you want to do but it's important to be honest and upfront about what you can or cannot do. Will every girl be okay with it? No. It is what it is for that, but there are people out there who are understanding and will understand.",

The point is hanging out with the person and getting to know them. Is this concept so alien now that we can only connect with people through materialism??\n\nThough I say all this, I have somehow amassed a small fortune of fast food gift cards that I will put towards first dates lol. Honestly though, why shouldn't a woman pay for a date if it goes well, or pay for her own share? Honestly, I think most decent women are fine with going 50/50. You have to avoid the ones that are just using you for a free meal. Or use a fast food app to pay, but only if you get bonus points or freebies out of it lol. Game the system.",

I'm always extremely nervous even when just writing back and forth. Often women aren't very active on the apps and let you wait. So the game starts and I overthink is she really not active or just ignoring me. Bumble shows the location of the other person if they've opened the app somewhere. So I start checking that.

I have maladaptive daydreaming and I day-dream a lot. In fact, I can’t imagine life without it (haha). It is how I have always dealt with boredom and isolation. It’s escapism, but I really don’t see that as a bad or crazy thing. Some people do drugs, others watch or play things on screens, and some people are religious or spiritual. I am not saying they are wrong, but they are all examples of people focusing on something other than this world. Although I do it in a way that is personalized, controllable, and requires almost no sacrifice.  If life sucks, why not focus on something better? If everything is meaningless, then it is meaningless to acknowledge that fact. So I decided, why be the bad kind of crazy when you can be the good kind?\n\nDifferent religions offer ways to cope with suffering. Some say your suffering is what you deserve as punishment, some say it is part of a divine plan, and others say you will be rewarded for your endurance. I also learned from the Hindu Mahabharata that those who are dedicated to “Emancipation” see everything as the same: gold the same as rock, silver like dirt, etc. A Buddhist text I read said something similar: everything is nothing, good may be different from bad, but they are both ultimately nothing. Religion also teaches that nothing in this world lasts forever, so it is best not to get attached. You see, faith and belief can improve people on their own because they break down the barriers of the mind. When the mind has no barriers, your actions are limited only by your body. This has allowed people to do things they otherwise wouldn’t have been able to, such as increased charity, fasting, starving and emaciating your own body, and even giving up your life. \n\nDuring the pandemic, when my life was empty as ever, I really got into dreams. I have been recording my night-dreams for a very long time. They are a great source of inspiration for day-dreams and during this time, they became sort of like a second world or life, whereas my real life was like a simple game where I just press buttons. Good times. It really helped motivate me to take sleep seriously. But this also led to new ideas. What if I could create a better world within myself? What if I could pretend I was on drugs and get the effect I desired? What if I could become a culture of my own? The very existence of dreams and hallucinations prove that the mind can create brand new experiences; it just needs to be “unlocked”. Something else I noticed in my dreams is that I could have fake memories. For example, seeing straps in an airplane in a dream and fondly remembering how when I was a baby, they would put us here during the flight where we’d play with toys. I learned that memories can be altered or even fabricated, so that may be useful if I ever want to forget something.\n\nI once heard about the concept of “tulpas”, which are basically imaginary friends for adults. I used to think that would take too much energy, but later on realized I had done something similar. When I was younger, I learned that talking to girls felt very therapeutic, so I gave myself an imaginary girlfriend. I met her during a night-dream and decided she would be the one. We listen to music, talk, watch videos, and go for walks together all the time. In fact, sometimes she is the one singing. She’s always there for me and I don’t know where I’d be without her. I also have imaginary friends. They are not like weird cartoon characters, just a bunch of normal guys and gals my age. They really help me to feel normal, as I talk to them about stuff and we go on adventures. That’s important, because I realized the cure to insecurity, neediness, self-centeredness, and wrong-thinking was to have “a life” and normal friends. After all, life is best spent with “your people” and it is best to discuss problems with people who actually care! You may ask “why don’t you befriend real people?”. Well, I find that hard since, in addition to my mental issues, I don’t relate to people well and rarely share interests with them. At the end of the day, I just don’t have much to say and am an introvert anyway. It’s alright though; I know some things can’t be forced. They have to happen naturally or not at all. You may also ask “why don’t you get a real girlfriend?”. Well, why would I do that when I already have someone closer than a soulmate? Also taking into account current trends and attitudes towards relationships, I don’t think it’s worth the money, time, and effort. There is the sex factor, but I doubt I’ll ever get it.\n\nNow, what I have said goes against what society says. But normal people don’t know everything. Some people become homeless, imprisoned, or just outcasted, some people become disabled and spend their lives immobile, and other people just become old and all their friends die. My point is that the world leaves many people behind, whether they deserve it or not. Even if I could have a “normal” life, I would not want to lose my ability to stave off boredom and loneliness. After all, if something is not a human right, you have to be able to live without it. \nBesides, regardless of your views, I think we can all agree this world isn’t meant to be enjoyable, so it makes no sense to try to get all of your happiness from it. The whole theme of what I have said is detachment. A lot of the people who disagree are too attached, they love to feel things. But I have to ask why? The whole point of emotions is to make us seek out good things and avoid bad things. But when that is impossible, it leads to suffering as we want an outcome we can’t have. So sometimes it is better to feel nothing. This could also apply to physical pain, as there are cases where it is best to distract yourself from what you are feeling rather than listen to the sensation. Maybe there is a point where we no longer need to feel. After all, you can still win a video game and complete objectives without feeling what your character feels. You may say that feeling things is what allows us to relate to others, but what if no one cares? Others say that if we can’t feel pain, how can we feel the need to help people who are? That does not really apply to me because no one wants anything to do with me. If I support any cause or ideology, my association alone will undermine it as people will say “that worthless guy supports them? They must be bad”. And I can’t really help anyone financially right now either.\n\nSo yeah, that’s the way I live. I’m pretty sure I’m right about this but I’m open to further discussion. Sorry if people don't want to see this, but these thoughts have been bouncing inside my head for years and I needed to let them out.",

So anxiety related disorders are probably held at bay to some degree by that.\n\nI could probably write a thesis-length post on that.

Now (before I get attacked for the former statement) not everyone is like that, people choosing to live alone due to traumas or just a lack of care when it comes to dating/finding a partner are also out there and would most likely hang out in this sub too.\n\nI agree with the statement, that most people are average looking, however I think (after looking up the usual types of neurodiversity) more people are neurodivergent that we tend to think, most  just became efficient at hiding their mental woes in public.",

You can have a relationship with an equally avoidant, socially awkward, bitter human and yes, you will feel better and distract yourself for a while, just like you would with a drug, but your inner problems will not be solved. They will bubble back up to the surface. You will feel more hopeless, trapped and lonely than you ever did before because you've latched onto someone just as broken as you and they latched back and both of you prevent each other from ever living fully or improving. This is a lesson that has to be learned through experience but I hope people can understand that until you do the work to fix yourself and your own psyche, you can never expect someone else to do that for you.

We do many of the same things we were told to do by the same individuals and yet rarely anything changes and it seems to be this way with almost everybody we try to meet.\n\nIn that particular case, it’s just super difficult to have any kind of hope if that’s been the result all our lives, because if nothing changed in our lives for decades, then what makes us think things are gonna get better? Even worse as we get older, it is hard to make friends or establish anything compared to when you’re a teenager or young adult. Combine that with our in ability to make connections when we were younger we have far limited options and far little chance for anything to change, such as being in a relationship, or finding a woman who loves us back.",

So i really dont consider that not alone. Im almost 30 and everyone just says get over it. I go out and say hey to people on my \"good\" anxiety days and i dont even get a response. I feel like theirs really not any hope for some of us, regardless of how hard we try or suffer. To some a normal day for them is like fighting in WW2 for me, anxiety wise. How can one be comfortable in public around strangers when you cant even be comfortable around your own family. Every part of you is just seen as wrong, and sinful, against gods will. Judged for being yourself inside of your own home, and everyone else doesnt give a shit. The few people i did have i treated sbove and beyond to try and finally turn my life around. And they just abused and took advantage of me and i ended up back at square one wasting my life trying to meet someone again. One can say, well you dont need someone else. And i disagree in that, we all need help at some point in some way, and theirs gotta be more to life then sitting around playing videogames and arguing with my piece of shit parents about literally nothing that makes any difference in the world.  To me life is about meeting people and building a life together in some way and enjoying each others company, but when everyone you know and met is bad, what is a person suppose to do.",

I now realize that is because people interacting with me didn't give them status, but for him it did. \n\n\nWhen i was kind to people, they thought i wanted something from them when i didn't (or was creepy for just picking something up for them etc), but people that bragged about themselves as being kind were praised as such.\n\n\nYes im jealous. Some people have 'it', as OP said. We don't, we need to constantly try to attain 'it' and often fail a whole life long.\n\n\nThe reality is that the halo effect exists and those who have it often can not relate to those with the horn effect. The world is just different for them.",

I grew up in a single parent home on welfare in the 90s and my dad was not part of my life at all so I was picked on a lot.

This is important to me I know if I start working out, I will definitely start to look more attractive and be more confident in my self. This is also important because I want to pursue law enforcement within the next year. In order for me to do law enforcement, I need to improve my physical fitness. I’m not entirely pursuing law enforcement for the money but in my city, they are paying about 60K per year for a lot of law enforcement jobs.\n\nif I can get fit and get my career started, I believe I can be a more attractive man and finally get into a loving relationship.

So (luckily for me?) that aspect of my life is ignored completely and any guests immediately move on to asking my more attractive, popular and successful cousins and second-cousins how their gorgeous partners are or if they’re still struggling to keep the crowds of ladies away. Comparisons suck",

After about an hour one of them messaged me privately saying my jokes and puns were funny and that she wanted to know who I was and get to know me. I was in awe as this thing sort of quite literally never happens. She added me on Snapchat. We exchanged stories, traded jokes, made each other laugh; I had zero expectations and remained realistic, but the chat carried on for weeks, texting dozens of times a day, we even eventually traded voice clips and I had the balls to share a couple of my least awful selfies. For almost two months we’d share close to 100 harmless messages and daily updates each; she asked if I would like to meet up for a stroll in the countryside on a nice day just to see if we would laugh as much in person. I immediately wanted to say no and find excuses, which I did for several days, just preferring to keep the pleasant illusion rolling. She eventually said that she would be in my area for the weekend. For whatever reason, I agreed to meet for a casual promenade on a sunny day. Despite us both starting off awkward and nervous, we eventually ended up chatting and she seemed to laugh a bunch, saying that her ribs hurt from laughing. When she had to get home, we parted with a fist bump and she said we’d do it again sometime. I made zero moves, did nothing creepy, and showed no romantic interest, was just in shock to be having a genuine friendly hangout day with a new person.\n\nIt’s been size days since and I’ve barely heard from her whatsoever. The only one or two replies I got were thumbs up or emojis. My usual jokes, questions about how her day is going or about her weekend plans were all ignored. When I asked her on Thursday if she was ok because she seemed quieter than usual I got “it’s called being fucking busy. It happens, just chill please”. Which was the first and only time she ever used a cuss word. And now she’s dead quiet, and has gone from sending 100 texts a day to total silence. Frankly I wish she had just told me bluntly what I had done wrong or what disappointed her most, it wasn’t a date or hookup, it was purely a casual friendly meet up, and somehow despite it being chilled and having a legit nice time, I still somehow gave her a reason to instantly get sick of me and start the ghosting. So now I just have the endless “wtf did you do you oblivious creep” questions facing through my head, and I’m wondering why I still let myself try to be sociable with women for any reason anymore, as somehow I quite literally repulse them and this time I get zero explanation whatsoever. It’s a tough reminder of why I stopped trying years ago, and why I’m going straight back to not trying from now on",

If I had made any romantic approaches, tried to physically touch her shoulder or hold her hand, or even tried the cringey establish-physical-contact plot of suggesting “hey don’t slip on the mud, here take my hand/hold my arm/hold onto me, you can trust me” etc, then I would immediately be able to assume that I pushed her comfort zone boundaries too early and too much and made her uncomfortable. As I said, being “rejected” or someone simply changing their mind about being friends is something that just happens, whatevs; but after her being the one requesting a meet-up and hangout so much and being so excited about it finally happening, and then suddenly deciding actually I changed my mind soz, with no explanation it just makes me think shit, maybe I genuinely am totally self-unaware and I’m my own blind spot, and that maybe my presence and body language make people way more uncomfortable than I realise. I’m wondering if I should just bite the bullet and ask her “hey listen, the convo has clearly reached its end and that’s fine, but is it because of me? What did I do or say to make you suddenly stop wanting to talk? I only wanted to be pals and I don’t understand what I did to suddenly make you do a 180• overnight”",

                        "comment": "Ouch. Story of my life. At the end of my teens, I’d amazingly befriended a girl I’d known as a polite acquaintance during high school. Despite being so pretty, she had always been incredibly shy, typically nerdy and anxious, and spent her school years keeping to herself within her restrictive comfort zone (basically just like me). \nMe and her randomly bumped into each other within our small community and gradually became very close friends, sharing various hobbies and interests and both aware that we were deeply nervous, self conscious and shy individuals. \n\nDuring a random conversation during a gaming sleepover at my family apartment, she admitted how liberating it felt to finally be becoming a young adult and gaining an identity she felt comfortable with, and how she regretted having spent so long as a nerve-wracked recluse, and that she was so proud of herself for finally dressing up and socialising considering that during her teens she had “only” hooked up/ slept with six guys; many of whom I knew as the quiet goth/emo dudes from high school who only ever stayed within their own tiny friend groups. And I was in total awe, wondering how a girl who admitted to being so shy and socially anxious that she frequently had to leave classes early and run home to cry in her bedroom, was somehow perfectly capable of meeting equally quiet teenage guys and establishing enough of a relationship with them that she lost her virginity and had various ensuing casual and romantic hookups with similar dudes. Luckily I bit my tongue at the time, but god knows I was soo tempted to blurt out “HAHAHA woman, you were clearly NOT an awkward shy teenager and NEITHER were any of the fuckers you were screwing. If you had ANY idea what it’s like to genuinely be self-conscious, shy, anxious and miserable, you would have been INCAPABLE of even fucking DAYDREAMING about accomplishing shit like that, let alone wishing for it”. I was in shock and struggled immaturely not to let my whole image of her as a friend morph into anything negative. It legit feels like I was the only moody, depressed teenager in the whole damn county who actually was depressed, sad and felt inadequate and hideous 24/7, knowing now that every other girl and guy, no matter how proudly they claim to have been awkward lonely teens, were hitting milestones and accomplishing social goals that an ugly, forever alone crybaby like myself was only ever crying about and wishing for.",

I could really only hang out with friends in groups because nobody would give me the time of day 1 on 1. I blended into the background, other girls rarely talked to me to vent/trauma dump, and not help me out in return, and guys only talked to me to get to know my prettier friends better. Some guys, even the other nerdy ones, were hostile to me for zero reason. One or two of them straight up told me how ugly I was.\n\nThen I learned how to use makeup. Suddenly my weirdly small close set eyes didn’t give off an uncanny vibe and looked big and feminine. My eyebrows were expressive and not invisible anymore. I started wearing contact lenses. At least 4 guys who were my “friends” that previously treated me like shit on the side of the street suddenly within a few months confessed that they’d always had a crush on me and wanted to date me :/ a lot of them said they were proud that I had gotten so much more “confident” over the past year, but really they were actually just taking the time to *listen* to me for the first time and they were seeing others do the same for me. I was more depressed than ever and constantly had the worst posture, always shrinking into myself, but they just saw the makeup and my styled hair. Girls wanted to befriend me more, too, but by then I was hit too hard by the whiplash of everyone acting different that I didn’t want any friends or dates.\n\nI thought there was something seriously wrong with me because almost every other girl I knew managed to have friends no matter how shy they were, I got constantly told that looks don’t matter, I just need to put myself out more, I’m not trying hard enough, only for people to do a 180 once I said “fuck it” and decided to improve my appearance a little. All those nights I wasted crying myself to sleep thinking I was the problem. \n\nMaybe it was the hormones or teenage angst but I became seriously suicidal after people suddenly started treating me like a human. It felt like everything was fake. One bad accident or serious illness that gives me a deformity or makes me gain weight, it’s over. I won’t be treated like a person anymore. Nobody can convince me that it’s just a high school thing either, adults are superficial as hell too. I’ve seen countless of adults subtly bully, isolate, and be condescending towards ugly people. It’s just less overt now\n\nIf you made it this far, congratulations! Here’s a cookie 🍪",

I focus instead mainly on keeping my limited but trustworthy friendships healthy and making plans for myself that don’t involve “meeting somebody” whatsoever.\n\nHowever what does drive me nuts are my parents, certain family members and a select few bored colleagues who not only remind me that I’m single and have never had a date, but that in less than a decade I’ll be 40 so “I’d better get a move on, no?” I mean what makes anybody think that I wasn’t trying my utmost the last 15 years just like everybody else was? In what setting anywhere is it ever normal, acceptable conversation to ask the visibly anxious loner why he’s been alone and single for so long because he’s running out of time before he’s missed his chance completely? The pointlessness of such questions and the fact that it provides nothing except a layer of uncomfortable awkwardness on an otherwise tolerable conversation (and somehow I’m the source of the awkwardness because I don’t have an answer for them; the person who needlessly blurts out the unwarranted question is of course totally blameless)",

It's not so much the weight part than it is the effort.\n\nIf you find you are an overly negative person, try to work through what has you feeling that way whether it means self-improvement on your own or with the help of a therapist.

If you think you are \"broken\" (looks aside) then you need to look at what you have to do to feel as though you are not broken because you shouldn't expect a prospective partner to enter into a relationship to fix you or \"help\" fix you.",

Obviously there are thing in our lives no one has control over. I can't force someone to choose me or be with me romantically and I can't will money into my bank account, but I can look for other things that make me (personally) happy. I can't tell you what things you can control that will make you happy and it isn't something you will know the answer today. Finding those things takes some time, but it's worth it.\n\nI am  39 years old and I am someone who struggles with chronic depression. I am medicated and have a therapist. I have been suicidal, but worked through that and still work on that to avoid those thoughts. I have had a friend commit suicide and know she felt alone despite having friends. It's been 15 years this year and it's still hard without her. There are choices for you to make but I hope you choose to stay.",

I know it feels super dark, to the point it almost feels like if you extended your hand out in front of you it would disappear but beyond that metaphorical darkness there is always someone... whether they are an online friend, a family member, a classmate or coworker.\n\n>I just wish for a real human connection you know I cant be alone anymore the materialistic stuff just aint cutting it.\n\nI totally understand how this feels. I wish I could give you a hug, friend. I am notoriously bad at irl hang outs, but if I could I'd hang out with you even in silence. This isn't a good solution for everybody, but I got a dog. A puppy. Right now taking care of him has been bringing me joy and the way he looks at me makes me feel like I'm his whole world--zero judgement. Obviously it's a lot of responsibility to have a puppy, and I don't take it lightly, but my connection with Laszlo has been a beacon of light lately for me.",

You know that playing the numbers game will increase your odds, but don't just focus on the outcome.  Try to actually connect with the girl before you make it known you want to date her.  Don't just zoom from one girl to the next, especially if they're part of a group, because it will tip them off that you're just prowling for anyone.  Women like to feel special and they like to make friends, so be a friend, even if it's only for 30 minutes before you ask them if they want to get a coffee.  \n\n2.  Pay attention to how the girl is responding to you.  You want to try and gauge whether or not she is actually interested in you as more than a nice stranger.  If she is going out of her way to engage with you, laughing at your jokes, and really conversing with you, that's a green light.  If she seems indifferent or dismissive of you, that's your sign to slow down.  Try to be chill when asking them out.  Don't pressure them and don't make it a giant event.  This person should like talking to you, and that's where you suggest you go talk together some other time.  That's basically what a date is.  \n\n3.  Make yourself datable.  It's more than just looking good and having money.  You should take time to learn how to talk, have hobbies and activities you can share with them, and keep your eye on events and places that might be fun to attend with a friend.  Have a next step planned out.\n\nAnd don't take rejection personally.  Some people just aren't interested in dating.  It's not always going to be something you did wrong, and you shouldn't waste your own time fretting over them when you're trying to find a companion.  \n\nMy 2 cents.",

In fact, I'd view it at a reprehensible personal flaw and egregious insult to my person if love found me.

Physically going into work and you meet a coworker you jive with, you regularly take your dog to a dog-meet event weekly and meet someone there... start taking dance lessons and get introduced to someone there... join a DnD club and meet up for weekly sessions and meet someone there, etc. I think that is the realistic scenario of something happening when you least expect it.",

The reason I like is because I also have a few friends (none close) and also sit at lunch alone plus I'm not into sociable and popular girls.\n\nThe reason I ask this is because I don't know how to interact with her without making it feel weird or creepy, everybody is different but I want an opinion from faw on this. Should I strike up a conversation or just forget about it\n\nAgain sorry if this sounds creepy or random I just really want advice. I don't mind advice from guys but I feel like it would be better from a woman's perspective. I tried posting in their own server but it got deleted so they must really not want guys there",

Idk, I'm just assuming because this is how I was in school with social anxiety disorder. I remember even attempting to do \"exposure therapy\" and I tried speaking to some other kids who seemed shy or quiet, and talking to them was like pulling teeth and it made me think, \"is this how I come across to people?\" Hope things go well.",

And let's be honest, there are only 3 possible reactions:\n\n1. she says no and wants to eat alone and tells you that very politely-> then it's a shame, but also not a problem and you know where you stand. \n\n2. she reacts ‘stupidly’ and gives you a bad feeling: Honestly, then that's also good. Then you have clarity and she's not worth your attention.\n\n2. she's happy: perfect (and I think that's what will happen). \n\nYOU are doing HER a favour and not the other way round. You are making an offer! A nice person would never take that as an insult. You are the opposite of a creep! You are friendly and you are ALLOWED to be interested in a girl!\n\nJust be aware that she might also be a bit shy. So just write down 5 to 10 questions you'd like to know about her. Then the conversation will be easier and there won't be any awkward pauses.\n\nHave the courage! As I said, I would have been delighted back then! Good luck :)",

You can keep it light and say such things as “I figured this must be the VIP table for the exclusive mysterious loners, I wasn’t sure if I need to apply for the official membership paperwork first, but it’s a lovely view from here, you’ve got great taste”. If she seems amused or smiles, that’s a good start, but if she’s clearly not enjoying being talked to and stays quiet, it might be a better idea to just politely say sorry and finish your meal. You can say that you frequently pass by but have never spoken to her, and that “life is about trying new things” and that you thought hey, I’m gonna chat to her and see what she’s like. You can ask her questions about what she enjoys, if she has hobbies, mention your own interests and hobbies; basically check if she’s comfortable speaking to you or is dodging your questions and wants to be left alone. She might even be grateful that somebody is making the effort to casually speak to her and make jokes, who knows. \n\nShe’s probably either sitting alone every day because she doesn’t have many people to talk to and isn’t sociable and so she’s lonely; or else she’s a naturally antisocial person and she prefers to be left alone and stay quiet because people in general make her uncomfortable. But you’ll never know until you ask, and the best way is probably to be very casual and easygoing about it, as I said, try to stay smiling and make gentle jokes about the situation, don’t make her feel pressured into a conversation, just make her realise that a dude who often likes his privacy decided to get to know the girl who also like her privacy.\n\n(If you’re in high school I can understand the added annoyance of surrounding people and groups noticing, pointing, gossiping etc might be distracting for her and you too; but fuck them and their world, there’s no time like the present and today is the day you wanted to chat with the shy girl)",

Some of your traits may have greater relative value (compared to the local competition) but there could also be traits whose value may be at best unaffected, and which may continue to cause women to not be interested.",

I am not trying to sound negative, but this is the harsh truth from a psychological aspect\n\nOur best alternative is to seek new friendships by going to social events related to our hobbies and interests, meetup is a great start. People go there to meet others who share same interests and value with them, and so it's easy to strike up conversation with a person you already have something in common with. I am not saying it will 100% work, but the more you go the more your chances increase.

It triggered a memory I had of her, and now I cannot get her out of my head. I feel this intense desire to reach out to her, but I am worried this obsession is unhealthy and it would be better for me to forget about this.\n\nShe has a tragic backstory. When she was just a baby, she went through cancer and survived. Despite not really knowing her growing up, we had a sort of connection where we went to preschool together as young children (I have no memory of her back then). We are both the same age and related as second cousins with the same last name. My mom told me about her and that's the only reason I knew about her.\n\nThen my high school graduation came. I did high school through a private teacher who took in kids who struggled in public school. I was a fairly high achiever for that class so I ended up going to college as part of a state program to do alongside high school when I was 16 and instead of showing up there, I was given course work to do on my own time. She ended up joining that same class for senior year and it wasn't until my graduation that we crossed paths.\n\nShe approached me directly before the grad ceremony, acknowledging my name like she already knew me and asked how I was doing and we talked for a bit, indicating her mom probably briefed her on who I was as well.\n\nI did not expect this and was initially caught off guard, but I quickly put the pieces together since I was told she would be there and carried on talking with her like we already knew each other. I'm not gonna shy away from stating that she is a beautiful young woman who was kind and seemed genuinely interested in what I had to say in a way almost none of my other closer relatives ever did.\n\nI am now 25, I have no friends, have never had a relationship, and I'm frequently lonely. I have had my share of parasocial attachments, but this one scares me. I am worried I hold these deepseated feelings for her and that is why I constantly think about her, and that's just messed up. I feel like there is something deeply wrong with me. I feel like I would be disappointed if she had a boyfriend (which is likely at this point), and how tf could that matter to me unless I had those underlying feelings caught up beneath this? Maybe that would get in the way of us connecting because she would have other priorities, but that's something that should make me happy for her.\n\nI think it's probably best I just move on and forget about her, but god, it feels so great imagining me and her catching up on life again even if it's just another 5 minutes.",

Needless to say, this one event (and the ensuing messy breakup) did a number on my mental health and it took me a very long time to get back to where I was. I went on a healing journey, picked up some hobbies, stayed consistent at the gym, and I tried to expand my horizons a little bit. All to make me a better person and with the goal of becoming more desirable. Don't get me wrong, I'm proud of my progress, but I was perfectly happy with the person I was before the breakup (Gym 5x a week, fluent in 3 languages, decent personality, etc.), so my main motivator behind further self improvement was finding a life partner.\n\nNow recently, I felt ready enough to start dating again. The apps were a complete disaster. Less than 10 matches total over 2 months (I tended to swipe right on 50% of profiles), with most either never responding or being bots/scammers. I did also go out and meet people, both through my hobbies (Rugby, book club, volunteering mainly), and at bars and clubs (usually went out with my friends on Fridays). I've always struggled to talk to women (really bad social anxiety and ADHD), so I never got anywhere at clubs and bars. I was able to give good impressions but I could never keep someone's attention before they got bored or moved on to the next guy. I had a bit more luck at the food bank I volunteer at and met this wonderful girl there.\n\nWe hit it off really quickly. Turns out we share a lot of the same interests (she was also a big reader and had been interested in rugby), and she even had the same tastes as I did with both TV and books. It all really seemed too good to be true, but when we get comfortable with each other I asked her out for coffee. Things went really well, and we committed to a 2nd date. The 2nd date also went well and we started dating regularly. We really clicked and started dating regularly. I made sure to be myself, which she seemed to enjoy, and I didn't bring up anything too sexual unless the conversation prompted it. I felt like I may have finally found that happiness I was chasing with my ex, so I made plans to ask her to be exclusive on our 6th date. We made plans, and I paid for a reservation at a pretty nice restaurant. I also set up a small surprise at an overlook nearby where I'd pop the question.\n\nI never got that far.\n\nOn the day, I texted her in the morning to make sure we were still on, and we updated each other throughout the day. Originally the plan was for me to pick her up and drive us, but she told me something came up and she'd meet me there. I guess this was the first red flag. I got to the restaurant, and I waited. I tried texting and calling, but 0 response. I waited until the restaurant called and told me they couldn't hold our reservation anymore, so I cancelled it, went home, and just cried for a very long time. I've been rejected, ghosted, and even stood up since I had started dating again but it never felt like actual betrayal before.\n\nThis was all 3 days ago and I don't think I've ever felt this lonely. At this point I've lost my motivation and only get out of bed to attend classes and get my homework done. I feel like some kind of freak, undeserving of love. I push everyone away, I did it with my ex, and now I've done it with this girl and I don't even know what I did wrong. She seemed fine earlier in the day but just dissappears later. We've met and hung out so many times. I just feel disgusted by myself. I thought I could handle failure but at this point it feels like a pattern with me as the common denominator. I feel pathetic getting this hung up over someone I wasn't even in a relationship with, and all the repressed memories from my past breakup have come rushing back.\n\nI've started to resent dating, but there's nothing I'd hate more than to become that one guy who sits in front of his computer all day and blames women for all his misfortunes. I want to be better. I work on myself constantly in order to be someone I can take pride in, I work out 5 times a week and I'm proud of my current state. But whats the point of living this life if I've got no one to share it with? All my close friends rave about how awesome their partners are, and how great they feel as a couple, while all I could do was grin and bear it with the hopes that I would also find someone I could share that joy with, but not anymore. I'm so close to giving up and I just can't see the point of going thru all this effort when it results in nothing.\n\nSorry for the vent, but I'm just so frustrated, it seems that no matter what you do, something happens. Either someone funnier/better looking comes along, or they realize they're not ready for a relationship, or they find out I'm just plain ugly. I just wish I could at least know why.",

So yeah, socializing comes with some extra challenges. Group settings are confusing and exhausting, and I often feel like I’m missing out on the unspoken rules of how to connect with others.\n\nI’m not looking for party scenes or hookup culture. I just want to know how people make day-to-day friends as an adult—like, how do you go from small talk to actually being in each other’s lives?\n\nIf you’ve been in a similar place, how did you meet people who *get you*?  \nWhere do those friendships start for you?  \nAnd how do you maintain them when things like mental health and sensory issues make socializing a limited resource?\n\nThanks for reading. I’d really appreciate any advice or stories from people who’ve figured this out or are still figuring it out like me.",

You can spend 1000 years going to a crowded event and socializing and never hit it off w anyone, or you can meet the love of your life sitting on your porch and they walk past and strike up a conversation. Ive got whati can onlt describe as crippling anxiety,  genuinely only able to walk around the block at best, and some girl said hi to me and strikes up mini conversations everytime i go past. Shes significantly older, and shes married with 7 kids, but thats really all it takes. Ive tried going to events and fighting past my panic disorder, ive tried saying hi to MANY people, just to be met with disgusted looks and death stares without a response. Theirs really not anything you can, or cant do. You just have to hope you have a lucky day and that its your time to hit the lottery. As for keeping friends, again, its pure chance. It unfortunately takes two people for a friendship to continue, and id say 9.5/10 i ever had in my life either give me one word replies constantly,  blatantly refuse to get together,  and you simply cant be friends or make a relationship work. Thats where my own mental anguish stems from, you can do everything right and still make no progress. Ive also had relationships, cheated on me in every one and begged for me back because i was the only one who ever actually treated them right. Truth is if you can be happy alone in this world it really is the best thing you can do for yourself.",

I had phases such as guitar, stand-up, long distance running, boxing. With these I practice them alone and sometimes practice with a teacher. When I feel confident I'll find places to play with others, as simple as a park. I will go to amateur events for more chances to engage my hobby in new ways. Keep in mind, I am bringing something to the table. I practice a lot and spend money to get better. When I end up meeting people with the same hobby it makes sense to engage them for advice or just talk about our skills and love for the hobby. Keep in mind, this works really well for friendships with the same hobby. Also, for me, making a general friend or a close-friend from this is all about luck and timing and takes so much mental energy. I'll make a few friends and then lose a few more. It's up and down.",

You took some risks and got valuable social feedback. \n\nI would dare to be pleasant but I'm a quiet guy with ASD and generally a dead pan demeanor. I don't have a lot of energy in general. Unfortunately though being around new people seems to take away any of my positive energy. I've come to a point where after years of rejections and past friends forgetting me in person and online I've learned to generally distrust and dislike being around other people. I also compare myself a lot. Yes a lot of that is based on my self loathing. Like this guy has X Y and Z and I have none and therefor I would be a worthless addition to his life or a laughing stock. and if someone is friendly I only take it with a grain of salt. Still nothing sticks and I impress no one so now I self-isolate. \n\nYou mention being obese and balding and ND and that you still made it work. It reminds me of a former coworker who had some social success. why? He acted positive and energetic despite his appearance.\n\nHonestly good job and congrats on being brave.",

They have experience which we don't, that's why they start getting married and having children when they're 30 while we still long for what they had 15 years ago. Our minds, when talking about romantic stuff, are literally far behind theirs.\n\nAnd that's what I think applies to you. You literally have the behaviour of a teenager cause you haven't matured past that. It doesn't have that \"wow\" factor for normies anymore once they've experienced it so much.",

For college i’ve been there for like 10 months now and nothing happened. College only had like a very few classes for 4 months So it’s not enough time to meet with anyone. Your only chance is joining clubs or events. High school gives more opportunity to socialize cuz you were trapped in the same class for 10 months but for college ur in each class for like 3-4 months only for one hour then you go home.

I always pay for first dates out of courtesy, and the occasional follow-up dates if I'm feeling generous, but no one unwilling to pay for their own stuff is worth chasing \\*period\\*. You're almost certainly not gonna find your forever after in your young adult years anyway, because 20-year-olds are basically slightly taller high school kids who don't know what they want, and either you or her might one day wake up and out of the blue realise they wanna move to Malta to become an olympic fish tosser or whatever. It's gonna feel cringe, but just put yourself out there and allow yourself to learn from these experiences, so that you'll be better equipped to date people when they grow out of their early 20s and become significantly less insufferable.
