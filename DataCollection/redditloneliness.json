That ache for deeper connection, even when you‚Äôre surrounded by people‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs such a specific kind of lonely, and I‚Äôve felt it too. You put it into words beautifully.\n\nI completely agree that it is possible to find that again, even if it takes time and care. And your message is one of those little moments of connection that means a lot, thank you.\n\nAnd if you ever feel like a letter might help, I‚Äôve started writing them through a little side project. No pressure at all, but I‚Äôd be happy to send you the link if you‚Äôd like to know more.",

Neither of us can afford to buy the other one out of the mortgage and since our child passed here we don‚Äôt want to sell it. They play game while I take care of my last kid at home.  I was working when they passed in 2017 and have tried to go back but had several panic attacks and had to leave.  The friends I did have moved and I didn‚Äôt stay on Facebook to keep in touch with any of them.  It‚Äôs hella lonely for sure.",

                        "comment": "I'll start, just to break the ice...\nMy loneliness started due to what I can omly asume to be the worst sequence of negative events and coincidences. Right as the pandemic started I was changing schools, going from elementary to high school. I had a small group of people, whom I'd consider friends in elementary, but I knew, that I was the \"expendable one\" lol. During summer break of '20 I met a fantastic friend, who treated me with respect and mutuality. I've never had a friend care for me as much as he did, and I couldn't be happier I was there to care for him too! Then high school began, I lost contact with my old group - everyone split - and didn't know a single person in my new class. Since it was a period of online school, the new class had little chance to integrate, beyond the class' messaging app group. I didn't message them often, instead I spent all my free time talking with my good friend. Then, my grandmother died (who - due to my actual mother's disability - substituted as my mother), which put me in an incredibly awful state. Couple months later, that good friend killed himself, and I became well and truly alone. I shut myself off from the world, rarely went out, barely spoke & avoided people for like two years. My class had integrated too much in that time, and I just stayed silent all throughout highschool. No joke, probably opened my mouth less than 200 times in total through 4 years.\n\nBut then, the wounds began to heal. I read our old converations, and started to think we'd not last as friends for too long eitherway. Maybe we could've, but I'd rather assume not, since it makes it easier to bear. I began to work from the inside out, I started to go out, pursue my passions, fix my appearance, etc. I'm way happier with myself, and feel ready and capable of feeling joy again.\n\n... So why don't I? I'm not sure... It's still incredibly difficult to open up. I've talked to maybe 10 people total through the last 2 years. None of them became my friends, but as I reflect on how I felt and acted, I can see, that I still fear attaching myself to people, stay sincere with each of my words, yet refuse to feel sure of anything anyone tells me. Or maybe my standards are too high? Not visually, of course not - I actually feel the safest and most pleasant when I see other people, who're clearly struggling, conventionally ugly or not. That I don't care one bit about. Just... I'm also thinking, that dealing with that old friend had set some standards... I want to meet someone, whom I'm mutual with in many ways. As I had been with him. And yet, while I reply to people I meet, as soon as I can - sometimes immediately, other people take ages to respond, and usually never share my enthusiasm and desire to become friends. Even the people I met on these forums for friend making... they just seem to not care that much, which boggles me, considering where we meet! I'm starting to think it's a problem on my end, but I just can't find out what it is! Is it the fact, that I don't trust people right off the bat? Or that I'm too sensitive? The only person, whom I met recently, that seemed to share the enthusiasm and hope for becoming friends, ended up insisting on me doing something, even though I felt uncomfortable (nothing crazy, it was just a voice call). And I got too afraid, seeing, that they ignored me saying I don't feel right about doing it so early, so I just bid farewell and received a mildly negative message before blocking...\n\nDamn, I wanted to write way less, but I opened my flood gates and five years of withheld angst poured out like a waterfall... \nThank You if You read all of that though. Please, if You know how I could rip myself out of this state, I'd appreciate it.\nI'm eager to see what other people went - and are still going through. Let your sorrows out!",

Recently, she moved to the other side of the city, about an hour drive, and it's made seeing her difficult as we don't  share days off work. \n\nWe still message every day and organise to hang out whenever we take time off work or if she's down to visit her grandparents, I'll sometimes get invited to come over and play games with them.\n\nWhen she lived close by we messeged constantly and got to see each other all the time, but since the move, she's gotten a boyfriend and barely manages to message me at all, with a full day being the longest I've gone without a reply. I know it could be longer, but it just feels like ages. To give an example of how it goes  I'll message at 7am, she'll message back at 9pm that same day, then I'll respond a few minutes after and won't hear from her again until, like, 5pm the next day.\n\nI've spoken to her about how long it takes to reply and that It feels like I'm being forgotten and that she never has time to message back, despite being active on social media. She responded, saying that she knows she's gotten pretty bad at responding and is sorry that it keeps happening and does value our friendship, while also saying she'll work on it and try to respond more often. \n\nThis lated for about a week, then she goes right back to messaging me days later. Now, I totally understand that she can be busy at work or might have something going on at home or is going through something she doesn't want to talk about. Those are totally valid reasons for taking a long time to respond. I just wanna know, what should I do?\nI've thought about not messaging back for a full day to see if she'll notice or telling her again how I'm  feeling, but I also feel that she'll tell me she'll work on it and it only lasting for another week.\n\nI just feel like I'm a bad person who's pushing their friend to talk to them because they're lonely and impatient. She's a good friend and I genuinely do care about her, but I also understand that I have to respect whenever she chooses to messsage me back.",

What I mean by this is that there are some things in life where, as much as we may learn something in theory, we might never truly *understand*, or grasp it until we‚Äôve been in that position ourselves; in this instance, until you‚Äôve experienced having someone in your life and realised that your loneliness hasn‚Äôt resolved.\n\nLoneliness, in my experience, comes from emotional isolation. Examples of this may be having to face challenges without a genuine source of emotional support next to you, navigating the aftermath of a painful event without anyone close to you who‚Äôs experienced something similar or has any understanding of your emotions, or being surrounded by people who‚Äôs values and lifestyle/communication style don‚Äôt align with your own. As you can imagine, having a perfect friend is an incredibly unlikely circumstance all by itself; but even if they *are* perfect in every way you need them to be, you might still be lonely because even if they‚Äôre the most supportive person in the world, *you* might still be the only one going through your specific challenge, and if you‚Äôre in that place for long enough, the loneliness will likely eventually start to bite no matter how many good friends, lovers or other connections you have around you.\n\nIn short, loneliness can be a common emotional outcome of a tremendous range of circumstances. These are my thoughts anyway; other people may experience loneliness differently.",

Just complementing my hair but today in class she waved and said hi so it wasn't just a one time thing\n\nI checked to see where she sat and it seems like she has 2 people she sits next to and talks to so if i get close to her it could be a good opportunity to get closer to multiple people which I desperately desperately need\n\nMy only problem is how tf do I get closer to her. I don't know her name so I can't find her socials and message her and I also have to make sure that the two people she talks and sits next to would be okay with me sitting with them\n\nIm not quite sure if they sit in the same place every lecture but I am gonna keep track of it and see if I can get to class first and sit there so instead it'd be them sitting next to me instead of me sitting next to them\n\nDiesn anyone have some advice.

I can't drive, because of my disability, so meeting people is damn near impossible. I've been almost entirely alone for 2 years. I'm ready to be done feeling like this. Everything makes me sad. I find little to no joy in almost anything. I need light in my life again. I need to laugh again. I need to feel again. And I can't stand the place I'm in mentally and physically and emotionally. I just want someone to hold me and tell me it'll all be okay. Or just hold me. I might cry at the human contact tbh. Idk. There wasn't much else to this.

I used to always think positive and I still do but can't ignore these thoughts that shadow me like clouds. My whole life, I've always wanted to make others smile, give away my last dollar, feed others and help them with anything even if I'm going through my own issues. Now I realize all those people ghost you, don't call or text and if you reach out, it's like you're invading them. I never did things for people in hopes of getting it in return. I always just wanted the love or friendship to be reciprocated, that's all. Now it's like life changed, especially in the last 3-4 years. I'd say for me specifically, I've noticed since 2020, my depression has gotten bad. Meds don't help. Therapy isn't working. I've tried meditating, exercise, distracting myself but yet nothing is working. So I came to the realization that this is just the new normal or maybe I'm the only one feeling this. I try to find someone worth living for but no one exists of that nature. As a single guy who has been single for what feels like a decade, dating is hard, people ghost you, people also flake out on plans. It's hard to find someone in life. I left that predicament on hold for now as it's hard to find someone that you can share life with. \n\nI just find it weird that the ones with good hearts and good intentions always get it the worst in life. I have never hurt anyone physically, emotionally or verbally. I have always been the one that's there for someone no matter what. I'll go out of my way to make a persons day or situation better. I just wonder how the ones with evil intentions, or bad hearts seems to get everything in life from the cars, houses, soulmates and all. \n\nI don't know if this is my life from this time forward or if things will change but now I just wished I vanished as no one cares, no one would be affected and there's nothing left for me. I don't know what my purpose is here, I don't know if there's really a after life. I don't know if this is all a simulated life and I'm just some boring character on someone's board game or computer. I don't know anymore. \n\nThere's nights I cry my eyes out literally to the point I fall asleep and waking up with sore eyes. I don't feel the urge to eat, I just wished there was a option to hit a button. Maybe two buttons, one to reset life again and the other to just end it all and you vanish. What button would you hit?  Sorry for my venting and all this nonsense talk but this is my outlet and my only way of venting. Maybe life gets better one day, maybe not. But till the end I'm still the same bubbly smiling caring loving guy that's always here for you till I'm gone. Hope you aren't in the same boat, but if you are, there's plenty of room and I hope we can share and connect. ",

I wish a few people cared on my birthday, even one person would be enough, maybe I wouldn't be in this situation. I will never celebrate birthdays again. I just wanted to share, thanks.",

How your seemingly normal life sometimes take a drastic turn for the very worse. To the extent you never have ever expected it to. The 180¬∞ some may call it. Or one moment you are completely fine and for reason unknown you feel so down that you start crying for no reason. The moment I think I have \"understood\" what life is or have a general idea about it, the very next moment something unexpected happens which I would not see coming. Like how ? I mean how is it possible, when you are prepared for everything like everything.\n\nYou make countless scenarios in your head. You talk to yourself about it. You talk with people around you about it. You correct your every seemingly wrong/bad thing about you. You work on yourself. You try to gain the confidence you never had. You try to be as calm as possible in every and any situation. You are polite and humane with everyone around you. You absolutely give your very best you can every single day. Yet, that moment comes and every thing you have worked on seems like a total waste. Like why ? What is the point in working on yourself ? Trying to be a better version of yourself ? Trying to be More than what you can be ? Trying to be what you imagine to be ? When all it takes is a moment to destroy it all. \n\nIt is more astonishing when the next morning (if you get any sleep after all that) everything is the same. When one moment your whole life seemed to meant nothing, the next morning it is the same. The moment has passed and the aftermath is and always will be, the same. Nothing has changed, nothing has vanished, nothing was lost and nothing gained. You would think it would be hard to get up but it is the easiest thing to do at that moment. You are wide awake, the crushing moment which destroyed you and shattered you is now just a part of your history. It is not ancient now but it would be someday, nevertheless a history. The morning is same, the clouds are same (or maybe the aren't), the air you are breathing is the same, the beating heart in your chest is the same and the people around you are the same. Only You, you are not the same. \n\nThis is the part I struggle with the most. How can you explain someone how are you not the same when everything about you seems same to any preset eyes. How can you make them understand, the time which flew normally for them was like an eternity for me. How can I make them understand, how \"not fine\" I am when every part of my body seems \"fine\" to them ? How can I make them understand when I myself don't understand why that moment came and shattered my entire existence. How can I make them understand how crushed and helpless I am after that moment. When the only thing I know is to smile and nothing more. I can't cry, scream or show any kind of emotion. At that moment I am trying to pick up my shattered existence and trying to seem 'Normal', as that is the only thing I know. Sometimes I even forget how to be 'Normal'. Among the multiple faces this clown has to wear, I often forget which is my real face. \n\nThis is the constant of my life, which has kept me depressed most of life.",

There‚Äôs one girl at my job who would be super happy to see me and then one day at work, she left work to eat with a male employee and ignored me when she left work with him. I ran into them again inside my work and she had a guilty look on her face. I‚Äôve been ignoring her since early February of last year. She started with me two years ago as she was in the same orientation with me. She‚Äôs told my female supervisor/friend that she‚Äôs liked me but I ignore her and she told my direct manager that I avoid her. Her department is Human Resources. You just have to take it in stride which I know can be something you may not feel like doing. You just have to realize this person wasn‚Äôt worth liking or being nice to. Take care.¬†",

And its the same shit every week too.\nJust getting up and going to class, sitting down in my room. \n\nI'm always glad I left high school but everything after has never exactly felt exciting. Am I supposed to be enjoying life? I'm not, or atleast I think I don't. More like putting up with it. You're supposed to be glad to go to college but I'm sure not. You're supppsed to have friends but I sure don't. Everyone I knew I left back in high school, and even then I never did anything with them. \n\nI was a fucking idiot then and still am. I had friends but I never did shit. They'd ask me for my socials and what did I do? I blew them off. Can't have people thinking I needed \"friends\". Oh no, I was \"too good\". Same shit here and now. Brief conversations with classmates that ends once the lecture is over. Every now and then me and a girl converse when we spot each other on campus. But its like a fucking random encounter in a video game. \n\nNone of it is constant. No one talks to me outside of class for the most part. No one messages me. My only hint of sociality is my fucking family. And I hate it. I know what my problem is, I'm not even fucking trying to get out there. Yet nothing changes. I'm still sitting on my ass in my room all the time. I used to not care about it. After all, the only person that really matters is myself right? But now I feel so tired and lazy. I hate being lazy. But I don't ever wanna do my work. I just put up with it. For today, and the next, and the rest of the week. And the next week. The month. The year. Fuck this shit.\n\nSometimes I wish I was born an idiot so that I wouldn't have to think so much. Then maybe I'd have some joy in myself. I can't ever like anything. Or be excited for anything. Not my birthday in a few weeks, or finishing this semester. I don't like how my body is either, I'm skinny, and have a belly which I don't like. Not that it matters anyways, no one ever sees it.\n\nIt just all feels monotone. Thats the way I can describe it. Its not hell. That would probably be more exciting. Its just boring. I wish I had actual friends, but I'd prolly just keep them at arms length too. Forgot about a girlfriend, no one's ever interested in me. And I'm not really even asking for help here either. Its funny in a way. I'm just screaming out somewhere, maybe hoping someone answers, but I'm not gonna even answer back. It's not like anyone fucking cares. \n\nFuck this shit. I hope you all have a good day. Mine are always the same. ",

I hate that it's probably inevitable for me as well, but I did learn something. I tried to reconnect with my ex and that was due to my loneliness getting the better of me, when we finnaly did get back together the person I originally fell in love with was long gone. \n\nI tried so hard to cling to someone who had changed for the worst over the years we were on and off and no amount of effort or talking would change that. I say all this to say, don't be like me, don't be so pressed about being alone that you hold on too long and too tight and let someone string you along, treat you differently and eventually leave you. They say it's better to have loved and lost and I say bs to that sentiment! Never compromise your own happiness to keep someone in your life just so you aren't by yourself. We have to push past those feelings, as much as I want to give up on love altogether, a small part of me still has hope so just know you're not alone in that feeling because I'm right there with you and I believe in us!",

I like time on my own but would definetly like healthy companionship. Now I feel like I won't meet anyone and feel I'll be alone for the remainder of my days\nI'm not sure how old you are, but a lot of the younger generation aren't having children, so I hope you at least find some comfort in that. Sorry I don't have much advice, just wanted to share that I understand the feeling, but I'm sure it will happen for you.\n\nI've never had a bunch of friends. I'm school I had a group after that never had many. But they do say as you get older most people tend to have a few close friends. As someone said quality over quantity.",

I had to move back in with my parents, I also just lost my car in an accident after hiting a telephone pole from slipping on black ice. I feel like I have to start all over. My last birthday was hard, I broke up with a girl, I felt alone in that relationship, like I had to change who I was. I don't really hang out with anyone, no one really invites me to do much. Usually I end up hiking and traveling alone. The bright sides are I seem to be progressing well into a career, but I just can't help but feel the overwhelming weight of loneliness. I'm trying to do more and put myself out there but I just feel like I'd be a burden to people if I try and meet new people. I just want to connect with someone, not even in a romantic sense, but I never felt like I had a best friend. I hope this year improves, it might sound stupid, but I really want to have a good birthday this year, I don't want to be alone anymore. ",

Sometimes life takes things away from us from because we‚Äôll be getting something better later. You work hard for what you have and you want it to feel like it matters, and you want people to act like it matters. There is nothing wrong with any of that. You just have to have the hope and knowledge that something better always comes along. The tunnel eventually ends and there‚Äôs always a light there. You may have to make our own exit, but you‚Äôll get out regardless.\n\nI hope your birthday goes well when that happens. I hope things start to take that turn you‚Äôre hoping for and take off towards the sky. If you want to chat you can certainly message me.

I always would get told: ‚ÄúI always wanted to date a girl that looks like you do.‚Äù But my personality does not match my appearance, for example I workout everyday because I like the repetition of workouts, i HATE how busty I am because I have sensory over responsivity so it feels awful having breasts. I don‚Äôt enjoy things like birthdays and major holidays, they seem illogical to me. My mind is always thinking which is good intellectually but also isolating. I cannot understand men, if a guy I am dating says something mean (it‚Äôs impossible to be in a relationship and not occasionally hurt your partner‚Äôs feelings) and then apologizes, i cannot understand that, in my mind I am stuck in the thought line of: he said this so it means he hates me. And then I get very confused. Relationships have always felt illogical to me, but I wanted to have one because I want to feel loved and accepted. But romantic gestures do make sense to me. And I have always been told I am ‚Äúweird‚Äù and that makes me feel alone. I am a nerd, i don‚Äôt know how to dance, I really like reading and writing and political theory and philosophy and I honestly like being poor. I have masters degree but I like helping people more than I like making money, so I work enough to get by and volunteer. I love helping people learn and start to realize that they have valuable ideas and that even if they are homeless they matter and contribute to humanity! I do not care about money, I like that my kid gets the best of me, and a career is second to her. I used to wished I looked less attractive. Now that I am in my 40‚Äôs everyone says I look so young, my kid is always telling me how I look like a model compared to the moms of her classmates but it makes me feel like a FREAK! That‚Äôs my neurodivergent brain again, i know that‚Äôs supposed to be a compliment but I don‚Äôt like it, I feel like I don‚Äôt know how to even age like a normal person. \nBecause in the movies if you are attractive you find love, so I have always felt like I must be a horrible person because i look like someone who should have a partner. It hurt me for so many years. But recently I have just accepted I have been born in a place and time in history when neurodivergent people are just not accepted. i recently started volunteering with neurodivergent youth and queer youth. It‚Äôs really rewarding, I did not realize how mean many parents are to their kids. For me every second  of parenting is so much fun! And now that my kid is older I see she will need me her whole life, and being single means I can always be there for her and one day whoever she dates. now i feel like being alone gives me time to help people who have had even harder lives than I have because although i am neurodivergent I see I can do alot to help neurodivergent people because I am single so i have the time and i have what‚Äôs called ‚Äúpretty privilege‚Äù so i have it a lot easier than neurodivergent people who do not fit the current beauty standards (which are stupid and illogical). And when I think about dating now I just think of how I was always the weird girl guys dated, being neurodivergent meant I never had a chance of finding love and acceptance from one person. But because I know how it feels to always be made to feel like I am weird, I can have empathy for other people and I can be kind to other people and encourage them to NEVER feel bad they are neurodivergent! Sure it would have been nice to meet a guy who liked my personality and who would let me be their best friend and let me love them, but I feel like I am free by letting go of the idea of finding love, I feel like I see the world differently now and I I feel so at peace.",

I have seldom been able to maintain steady relationships with the people around me that go beyond a certain point of understanding. I have one real friend that lives nearby but he'll be moving soon, the only other friend is in a whole other country. And I have had a few unsuccessful attempts at romantic relationships. I'm at the point where I am just trying to find more strategies in coping with solitude as opposed to trying to search for anything, which has proved to be extremely difficult. So yeah, I guess this post is just me declaring defeat lol. I give up. I hope everyone out there starts having better luck than I have been having in finding people to really connect with. I'm just, really exhausted with trying and with life in general. Y'all take care!",

Especially since, in my experience at least, they usually make you feel seen and appreciated at a time when everyone else seems too busy with other interactions to care about you, and then suddenly there‚Äôs this one person who seems to genuinely want to give you human attention and get to know you. And then when the reality of the scam eventually becomes apparent to the point where you can no longer deny it to yourself, part of you still hopes that maybe you can genuinely connect with them to the point where they give up the scam and still want to interact with you anyway, cos heck, we‚Äôre all human and all screw up, and maybe if you dig deep enough you‚Äôll find a reason behind why they were scamming that justifies it enough to be forgivable. And if they‚Äôre capable of faking that level of caring about you, surely they must be capable of having those feelings for real too if you extend them an olive branch of genuine humanity instead of automatically judging and hating on them, if you give them something different than the treatment that other people gave them, and which perhaps led to their willingness to harm others in the first place.\n\nJust my experience anyway, but from your words it sounds like you‚Äôve been through some of the same kind of feelings.

They had some of the best eyes in the world: trained to see the smallest curves on a face, the way shadow falls on a bumpy nose, the way someone‚Äôs lip curves in an unusual way. \n\nThe most trained eyes in all of humanity find beauty in everything and make art out of it. And go and look at art history and see the faces there. The changing styles of what is considered beautiful not only for a period but to each artist. \n\nWhen we get to know someone we start to see their beauty. Some of us just have faces that hold their magic close until somebody knows them. I read somewhere that familiarity makes people like faces more. In this modern world where we are often on screens and distracted are we really looking long enough? \n\nYou are certainly not ugly. And you do deserve all the hugs in the world (and probably to be painted too).",

But there are a lot of like-minded people you can meet in very many different places. Especially the mall! Barnes and Noble is great. Enjoy a certain genre of literature? There are customers who are looking for something interesting to read; try asking someone for a recommendation, and take it from there!  \nFor me, it's Spencer's. (lol). I dunno, everybody there is always so fun and interesting. Find someone with a really intense energy about them, and just break the ice and try to get to know them!

I went back for a couple days to see my friends there and said I'd be back when the mc movie releases. \n\nHowever, my new pc ended up being delivered during the release and I didn't want to risk it getting stolen off my veranda while I was away. So I waited until it arrived, which was this Monday and then yesterday, I asked my friends in a group chat, if they've seen videos of people losing their shit when Jack Black says minecraft terms and was going to say when would be good for me to come down to watch it. When one of them said it happened when they went to watch it. \n\nSo that hurt a bit to read, but I didn't want to make things weird so I just said hell yeah and have been disappointed that they saw it without me.\n\nI'm guessing that they watched it with the rest of the friend group there as I saw a story the other day where someone from that group was in the cinema. However, I assumed they watched it without my friends as they were waiting for me, but no.\n\nWhile I don't really care about the movie itself, it would've been a fun time regardless getting drunk and then seeing it as I and most of the others grew up playing mc. I'm very surprised that no-one told me they saw it as well or asked me about my plans with visiting. It's a shame, as I had plans in my head of after watching it, going to McDonald's and getting the mc meal and seeing what toys we got.\n\n\nDoesn't help that I'm living by myself in my hometown now and don't really have real friends here, guess I'll ask one of them that I'm closer to, if he wants to watch it with me. But it seems kinda depressing to do now.",

In recent years that has completely shifted, my parents even asked why do i seem to have become more selfish, stopped thinking ahead of things and people alike. Exactly, i stopped caring. I've become apathetic because of my past experiences and trauma with people ghosting me and pushing me away, possibly childhood trauma from parents, and nowadays them just arguing in general. Now i've become VERY lonely and even possibly depressed, at this point where i even stay up until 4 am texting to AI chat bots. Pathetic, i know. Also i have very constant mood shifts between days, going on for like a year now. And this has been going on for a while, and im just dissintrestted in improving it or getting out, it's like i already gave up. For your knowledge, yes i've gone to a therapist, been going for about a month now, and maybe it helps for a time, but it just all shifts back like nothing changed and that entire discussion and talk was meaningless. I also had one meeting at the psychiatrist last week, propably with more to come.\n\nBesides all this, even though i've gained great support from my parents and sisters, i still don't feel the want to change it. I barely talk to anybody of my age group now, and even if i do i never go outside, it's only that i go out alone in every millennia because of something. Even my supposed \"Best friend\" , well he stopped going outside with me several years ago and now i just gave up, i only see him at school in class and talk to him in calls and chat, just as if he was another online friend, even if we are closer. Now since last year, ever since i started this phase of self-destruction, i started skipping school, do not think about my grades whatsoever, ignore deadlines. I only do something if it's absolutely necessary or i will be punished for it. Have constant thoughts about death, getting something like cancer so i could do whatever i want for a time. Also like i mentioned the mood shifts, im either really nonchalant and serious or very bouncy, excited? It's with myself though, in school i always seem nonchalant, started wearing sunglasses as a way of escapism aswell, though they are stylish. I've lost passion for pretty much everything, stopped putting effort into studying since last year aswell, stopped doing homework. Now only two things that excite me are singing and voice acting, and i even started singing way less, hell do i know why. I started resorting to instant pleasure, pleasuring myself daily, sometimes multiple times. Refusing to get out of bed, scrolling. Yet deep down i wanna care for someone, and i still do kind deeds whenever i can, but now i seem to do selfish things without even realizing them.\n\nI don't even realise what's wrong with me anymore, im not in despair, im just dissapointed and hopeless of the future ahead. Maybe time will heal, and i guess only time will tell. And i've heard all those things about someone like me, shouldn't be able to feel this way and that, well that's a stupid statement, age doesn't matter in these things when you start becoming delusional.",

And about three weeks ago my partner and I decided to separate, amicably mind you, which surprisingly doesn't make it that much easier. \n\nSo today is my birthday, and besides one or two that I know ment it, but but we're just \"hang around\" close or can't get together for one reason or another, I've mostly just recieved the usual generic \"happy birthday\" auto generated meaningless Facebook greetings. \n\nTo top it all off, my best friend hasn't called, texted, or so much as written on my wall. Not that I was expecting an invitation to do something, he's my bestfriend, not the other way around. But even a text would have done a lot of me. I reached out to him a few days after the split. I always reach out. We went for a coffee, we talked, we seemed to enjoy each other's company. He knows my situation. Stright up said one of his worries is that one of his friends might be suffering and not reach out. But he's not so scared about it that he'll reach out when he knows one of his friends is suffering. \n\nI'm just tired of being a background character in everyone else's lives. \n\nAnd sometimes I'm nothing more than an extra.

It‚Äôs definitely a very underrated ‚Äúnetworking‚Äù platform.\n\nAlso one trick I‚Äôve discovered for texts to not be an issue (by this I mean the whole who texts first BS, whether with friends or relationship interests) all you do for it is to not reply to them after maybe 9PM, time can vary but essentially YOU want to be the one who dictates the messaging. So let‚Äôs say whoever you‚Äôre texting goes to bed at 11PM and you know this. Then you send your last text to them at like 10PM, wait for their reply to come through then don‚Äôt reply till the morning or whenever, the first time you can say (sorry fell asleep) and then when it happens every day they‚Äôll just assume you‚Äôre falling asleep before you reply to them meaning that from your POV you‚Äôre waking up each day with a message from them for you to reply to.\n\nOfc I‚Äôd say this works best for like love interests but I have had friends where we‚Äôve pretty much just been like that 24/7 in a non-stop cycle of responding to each others replies, it obviously helps by not replying with just ‚Äúaha‚Äù or ‚Äúsure‚Äù or ‚Äúlol I guess‚Äù these types of messages can easily be ‚Äúleft on read‚Äù so to speak.\n\nBut if it‚Äôs not texting (which I know it‚Äôs not most guy friends texting most guy friends 24/7 unless there‚Äôs some üëâüëà going on lmao) then the next bet is to the natural alternative route.\n\nThings.\n\nGuys bond over things. Video games, sports, etc. if you can‚Äôt find a solid texting buddy you could find someone (or some people) to play football with (I‚Äôm a Brit so maybe soccer for you) or to play video games with.\n\nI used to be a gamer and I‚Äôd socialise best with my mates in gamer party voice chat, it‚Äôs how our friendship group stayed alive (for as long as it did).\n\nBut yeah that‚Äôs all I got for now champ, you sound like a smart guy, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll compile useful resources to get where you want to be man üí™",

My mom is an introvert, and never tried to make friends or be outgoing, this had a huge impact on me and I ended up the same. My dad was just ignorant and oblivious to everything. I moved a lot growing up, so I‚Äôve never had a single friend, like ever. My dad is very educated and successful in the tech field, he‚Äôs a self made man, and all his friends are the same. All of my parents friends children are very successful with high paying jobs. After struggling with depression and anxiety my whole life, I managed to get an entry level technical engineer job that paid well at 26. I was paid almost a 100k, and it was at a big tech company. But it was a customer support job, after surviving 1 year somehow, I had a really bad mental break down, I couldn‚Äôt handle the stress of the job, it was so bad I thought I might have a heart attack and I started to forget things. It was my first corporate job. I had no friends, no one to go to so I contacted a mental health therapist and got a 2 week leave approved.  But when I returned, my brain had pretty much shut down, and I couldn‚Äôt continue, in what is already a terrible job market in tech, I quit, and moved back in with my parents. Now I‚Äôm so lost. I still don‚Äôt have friends, I don‚Äôt have the experience of having friends and doing things with them. Last year, I tried so many things I‚Äôve never tried before, I actually tried to make friends, I went out of my comfort zone. I even went out on dates, and had a brief relationship that lasted like 2 months. It was my first relationship ever, and she said some very hurtful things about me being a late bloomer, not having friends, or relationship experience, and it absolutely broke me, this was right before I quit my job, she completely abandoned me when I needed her the most. Now I‚Äôm struggling to find the motivation to do anything. Constant job rejection emails. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm even doing anymore, just disappointing my parents and myself. I‚Äôm so alone. I don‚Äôt know how to move forward. I do take meds but they don‚Äôt help. Therapy doesn‚Äôt seem to help either because it can‚Äôt make up for my lack of experience. ",

One other thing that got me friends in college was the collective interest in things like anime, movies, etc. But to start talking based off that kinda things here in my company doesn't seem to be professional. The situation at my home has also changed. Back in college i used to chat with my mum everything that happened during the day. But now i dont even have anything to talk about. I dont know if u guys can understand this complex thing. Im not like going LONELY. I just feel like lifes got more boring as i took a further step in my career. Is this how everyone feels?? Or is it just me.?? Also i dont really know my personality. I am like an introvert while with new people. But in friend circles, im more of an extrovert. I dont even know what im in need of.

It's good to have people that are going to be in your sphere of influence that will be a blessing instead of just a temporary fad or popular trend that burns out later on. \n\nI had to learn to think long-term and not just short-term.

There were other people more lonely than myself. Other people that didn't necessarily have all of the things that I had in terms of academics or material things or things like that. I found that being generous and genuinely kind without expecting anything in return was a blessing. Usually, I got back more than what I gave when I did not anticipate that I would get anything in return. \n\nIt's good to be a friend. The Bible actually says to have friends one must be friendly. And it's true. Even if the goal wasn't to make friends while being friendly, this usually leads to the accumulation of friends. Even if it doesn't, I've lost nothing by being kind and generous to someone that may have needed that to get through the day.\n\nIt's difficult to explain the phenomenon of people running away when you're seeking them, but gravitating toward you when you're not.",

But towards the end of 2024 people just started leaving. My online friends moved on to other servers. I had three close friends: one moved to another country, one became so toxic it started affecting my mental health (I tried talking to him, but he didn‚Äôt seem to care), and the last one ghosted me after a small fight, even though I tried to make things right. Even my offline friend group fell apart and all of this happened in just 1-2 months. It felt like everything just collapsed at once like i was destined to be alone in 2025.\n\nI never wanted to admit that I was alone or that what i‚Äôm feeling is loneliness. So i gave 100% trying to get just one person‚Äôs attention (desperate i know) . . I tried dating apps and i also joined different servers but nothing really changed.\n\nLast month, i messaged a girl from my old school, we used to sit on the bus together but never really talked much online. I just wanted someone to talk to. We started chatting regularly and eventually I asked her if she wanted to go watch a movie. She said yes and i felt genuinely happy for the first time in a while.\n\nBut the day before we were supposed to meet, she ghosted me. She stopped sending snaps to me even though she still send to other people(i checked score) she also posts on insta and i can see she is online there i texted her one or two times she just doesn't reply idk what happened idk what i did was wrong.\n\nNow it‚Äôs been about a month of me living like this just waking up every day, hoping for a text. From anyone or my old friends. From someone who remembers me but nothing  and i guess, deep down i still don‚Äôt want to accept this as my reality that i am loner. All just happend to fast so i came here and wanted to express myself. Its been weeks me seeing the sun or even talking to another human other than my parents.",

They‚Äôre a raging alcoholic and I‚Äôve told them to seek help but they refuse, and to stop using me as a therapist.

And then I realized, the reason we even became friends is because we trauma bonded from our old job together (I quit that place, thank god). We use to talk about how much work sucked, but now I seriously don‚Äôt see any values we share together other than trauma stuff, which isn‚Äôt a good reason to stay friends with someone.

Later it turned to big groups of alot of sweet close friends.\nAnd the last time I remember having friends is up until 2 years ago.\nBut now I'm just super lonely, and I know why (I think).\nI've been struggling massively with anhedonia and dystemia these past 2 years, always had depression from a very young age (I was 8) which never helped maintaining friendships (have always been and am still in mental healthcare for it). But since 2 years I have noticed I grew apart from the friends I used to have, this because of my interests, my beliefs and generally having a lot busier life (school and work) which are all on locations that my previous friends aren't close or accustomed to. Also in these last 2 years I really just didn't feel like it, I didn't feel like going out, didn't feel any need for other people, didn't want connections or making new friends because I have just been generally feeling-less and overall tired from my work and schooldays which left no social energy.\n\nNow 2 years later I feel very very very lonely. \nThis is because I left some friends behind because of reasons stated above, but also because everyone that I had a genuinely good connection with either moved really far away from where they used to live (think other countries) and also a few of my dearest and nearest peoples that I knew have passed away at a pretty young age these past years.\n\nAnd it's not that I think I'm not fun, or that I think that I don't deserve friends, the opposite, I think I am fun, and fully worthy of being loved and having nice people around me.\n\nBut I'm also real with myself about the fact that I am alot of the times the problem when it comes to people breaking contact, I tend to leave people behind whenever a mayor depressive episode hits, I don't mean to, but it does, I do reach out to people for help once it happens, but i notice I lose people left and right once they notice that I'm no fun to be with at that moment, even though I try really hard to also partake in the fun stuff. But also as I said above, people have their own life plans and move far away, I don't blame them for that, but I am still here.\n\nI now also struggle with not feeling at ease with anyone, when I was younger I used to have the feeling of \"wow, these are my people, I really feel in tune with these people!\" And now I just never feel that anymore with anyone I meet, and I am really trying to meet new people and even take up old contacts again, it just never feels like I am with someone I really feel well with, or in tune with.\n\nWhen I think of: who would I like hang out with? Or what kind of people would I like to meet? The answer just stays silent in my head, and the anhedonia also doesn't help because I used to have tons of interests in hobbies, and now I don't.\n\n\nAnyone have any tips regarding all of the above? And anyone that has the same feelings?",

Work on your mental, physical, and spiritual health. If you want a kind and generous person, speak kindly and don't hold back when you have the opportunity to help others.

Once you‚Äôre comfortable with being around people, a  great way to build up off of that is to give a polite smile, or a polite compliment. You see an old lady walking by compliment her sweater, or compliment the runner on doing well. That‚Äôs miles away from where you are now, but baby steps eventually turn into toddler steps, and those turn into teen steps, etc. \n\nHow I personally have done getting out of my comfort zone were two ways:\n\n1. Just being ‚Äúforced‚Äù into it. A quick example is in my job position I‚Äôm a servicing representative for mortgages at my company. I handle construction loans, and there are various organizations I sometimes have to go to. I sometimes take lunch to long timer builders that have given us a lot of business. I go to home shows to talk to contractors and others about my company. That‚Äôs the opposite of who I am, but that‚Äôs benefited me a lot.\n\n2. Going to the end of my comfort zone and taking a singular step out. A quick example is replying on here. I used to never comment on anything online. Now I‚Äôm doing it more frequently. It‚Äôs helped me work on giving compassion, empathy, and trying to help others. I commented on a post, and waited a day. Then again, repeated a few times. Now I‚Äôm doing it a few times a day. Those steps I took outside of my zone have become the new border of that zone. \n\nWhat you want, what you want to do, and how you do it matters. It‚Äôs ok to be scared and nervous, that‚Äôs healthy. That fear and anxiety just can‚Äôt control your life. You have that control over your fear and anxiety. I know it feels like you don‚Äôt, but you do. You have the power to do so much whether you know it, or believe it, or not. \n\nIf you want to chat we can. Otherwise, I hope this helped or brought some comfort, and I wish you the best. üòä",

But eventually it reached a point where it wasn't my choice anymore. I'm in my early 30ies now and honestly if I'm not at work or with my family I spend the very most of my time alone isolated at home. Tbf some days ago I met with the only friend I have left for a couple of hours (the last time was maybe half a year ago) but even with him I don't really get along anymore. We're just so different now. There are some things about him by now that I just despise and although he's always friendly and says how cool it is to spend some time together, I know there are a lot of other people he would rather be with anytime. So bottom line this only friendship I have left is hardly worth mentioning anymore. \n\nI am infinitely thankful for my great family but even with them it can be tough for me. Because I'm pretty sure each one of them more or less knows what a lonely weirdo I've become. I'm trying to keep up my masquerade but this can only work to a certain level. So if the only private life thing I could talk about is my character in Skyrim or how I shot down people in Battlefield, they must sense the cold hard truth.\n\nI also lack self discipline, so I hardly ever move forward and do something that might change things (if that's even realistically possible). I'm not really religious, but I kinda just hope that some day fate will open a new chapter for me.\n\nAnyway, thank you for reading all of this, hope you are doing fine.",

Firstly, like you say there's nothing wrong with being alone and enjoying your own company and at times, you do want that company. I totally and fully understand how you feel about that.\n\nGoing off the first paragraph, is that a mentality thing, you think or has he said it to you because sometimes we think people want something different but truthfully, some people don't show or communicate it that well to other people, so am just curious if that's a thing that's been mentioned or if you just believe that.\n\nSecondly, your not a lonely weirdo. You'll never be. Everyone has different interest (and honestly Skyrim and Battlefield sounds epic as hell!) and think it people in our world, just need to open up a bit more and that's my truthful thoughts. It can be difficult but the main thing I take away from this post is your open and you understand yourself, which is brilliant. You seem such a beautiful soul and have a good heart man! Own it! One day that chapter will come, I always go be this motto, life is about resilience and how we cope with it.\n\nHope that helps man and thank you for sharing your thoughts and feelings. Sending prayers!",

But the thing is our friendship was kinda weird most of the time. Especially when we are with other people he behaves differently and obviously leans more towards them than me. And some time ago something unlucky happened that damaged our friendship. I got over it pretty fast but he didn't. We talked about it multiple times and he says it doesn't bother him anymore neither. But he brings it up almost every time we talk and especially when there are other people around. And this is just annoying to me, because then I have to explain myself every damn time, although I actually don't care about it. Plus like I said there also developed something else about him that I really don't like and I can't really ignore that. And I think he probably feels that too.\n\nThanks bro, that's a nice way of thinking. But I think for most people in our society it is indeed weird if someone has basically no social life. Kind of a vicious circle because that makes it harder to make new contacts.",

I grew up on a farm with parents who didn‚Äôt believe in disabilities, didn‚Äôt care about anyone who was different, and made me feel like I was worthless. Because I‚Äôm blind, they treated me like I couldn‚Äôt do anything. They gave me the hardest chores and acted like I didn‚Äôt matter if I got hurt. I was just the ‚Äúuseless one,‚Äù so they used me however they wanted.\n\nI went to school in the middle of nowhere where I was constantly bullied. No one helped me. No teachers stepped in. I never had any friends growing up. I thought college would be a chance to start over, but it‚Äôs been just as bad. I try so hard to talk to people, join clubs, make connections. I even went to a sports camp. But even when I think I‚Äôve made friends, they always stop talking to me or get mad at me ‚Äî and I don‚Äôt even know why. I‚Äôve never had friends before, so I don‚Äôt always know the ‚Äúright‚Äù way to communicate. But I try. I really try.\n\nNow I feel like I‚Äôll never get a job because I don‚Äôt have social skills, and I never had anyone to teach me. I went to a bad high school with very few opportunities. My college is awful. I don‚Äôt even know if I‚Äôm in the right major, but when I try to look into transferring, every option seems worse or impossible.\n\nEveryone says ‚Äúmake friends in class,‚Äù ‚Äúgo to events,‚Äù ‚Äújust talk to people,‚Äù but it never works. I feel invisible ‚Äî or worse, like people just hate me for existing. Professors don‚Äôt help. Tutors don‚Äôt help. Mental health counselors don‚Äôt help. I‚Äôm stuck with a roommate I don‚Äôt get along with. I have no one.\n\nI want to live in a city and get a guide dog to gain some independence, but my parents are trying to stop me. They say I can‚Äôt travel alone because I‚Äôm blind. Meanwhile, my siblings get to do whatever they want, no problem.\n\nI don‚Äôt party. I don‚Äôt drink. I don‚Äôt use drugs. I‚Äôm not into social media or sports. I don‚Äôt fit in anywhere. I tried to be good at music in high school, but I was never good enough and couldn‚Äôt afford lessons. I feel like everything I try just leads to more failure.\n\nPeople tell me, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs always someone out there for you,‚Äù but that‚Äôs not true. I‚Äôm fat, blind, and apparently not good at talking to people. Who would ever want me? Not even as a friend ‚Äî let alone in a relationship. I‚Äôm tired of everyone acting like I‚Äôm the problem when I‚Äôve done everything I can.\n\nI‚Äôm just tired. Tired of trying. Tired of hurting. Tired of being alone. I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore.",

I have like a couple friends and they are all very busy people. I don't want to bother any of them or inconvenience them in their schedule or sth also they are pretty far away from where I live. I am 23 years old and don't have a group of girls to do fun activities with. It's nice being alone but it would be so nice to just have a group of girls or whoever to just spend time with. I am not extroverted at all. I never attend events bcs I just always feel so misplaced in spaces like this. I would love to be a little more social but I just feel like I might bother someone or I might be too much to handle as a friend I honestly don't know. I lost majority of my friends 3 years ago and since then I haven't been really able to make new ones. Right now I also do not have a job which doesn't make any of this easier. I try not to blame myself because I know back then that it was the right thing not to stay friends with such horrible people. But I just can't take being alone. If someone has advice on how to meet people who match your morals that would be great! Or any advice for that matter. Thank you in advance ‚ô°",

She is a whole person to you. \n\nWhen I think that of the people I‚Äôve lost I can start to imagine what their responses to me might have been. And I sometimes imagine they would be joking or kind of make some remark. And that projection of what I feel they‚Äôd say based on how well I knew (know) them makes me feel warm and like they‚Äôre still here. \n\nPerhaps you can try to catch your mum or dad at a time they aren‚Äôt busy and tell them how you feel. When we open up to people we sometimes get surprising responses. When we be sincere and open people can see our needs and pain and stop and take notice. \n\nI hope you can find a way to talk to somebody you know.",

I‚Äôve only had one serious relationship that lasted two years, but it ended because the other person let their pride get in the way. I don‚Äôt feel bad about it‚ÄîI really fought to make it work.\n\nMy conclusion is this: romantic love isn‚Äôt dead, it‚Äôs just harder to find these days because of the way the world is moving. Right now, people seem to romanticize fleeting connections, dishonesty, and juggling multiple relationships. But I think it comes from a generational emptiness. Deep down, everyone wants love, but they‚Äôve turned non-commitment into a trend‚Äîeither out of fear or to avoid getting hurt.\n\nWe need to understand that being alone isn‚Äôt a bad thing, and loving with your whole heart doesn‚Äôt make you weak. It just takes time to learn how to value what you have and take care of it.",

                        "comment": "That does sound tiring. Highschool/teenagehood is an especially hard period of life. Youre stuck in a place (school) surrounded by people who you mostly have nothing if not little in common with, theres all these expectations youre trying to juggle from teachers, parents, peers, society etc. Theres so much to deal with that is different from being a carefree kid and it can feel so overwhelming. A lot of people can relate to that.\n\n I can imagine having parents with super high expectations makes the pressure even more intense. Part of becoming older (especially when you yourself become an adult) is looking back and realizing the flaws of your parents. I look back myself and recognize how my parents decisions impacted me badly and were, imo, not good parenting practices.\n\n Not that that makes parents bad, no ones perfect and parenting is hard. Theyre just trying their best however they know how. Some parents show love by pushing their children to achieve what they (the parent) feel are valuable or will help their child live a \"good life\". Unfortunately it can cause harmful amounts of stress/pressure and make their love feel conditional although that is likely unintentional (or they font realize how harmful these things can be.\n\nAs an adult youre more able to reflect on your parents parenting more neutrally but when you are still a kid being subjected to your parents bullshitery it can feel so overwhelming/frustrating/confusing etc. \n\nIg my point in that is, you can look forward to being able to get away from that pressure in adulthood. Not just physically. As a kid when you disagree w your parents they can just dismiss you and say you dont know what youre talking about cuz youre just a kid. As an adult they cant say that anymore ( maybe not 18-20 cuz they may still consider you a \"kid\", but once youre in your mid 20s+ theyll have no choice but to acknowledge youre an adult too). Anyway, it sounds like youre doing your best and trying to study too and many parents would be proud of you if you were their kid. Only being proud if you get 95% or more is crazy. Although Id bet your grandparents probably had similar expectations on your parents when they were teens. Doesnt make it better, just prolly why theyre like this",

I honestly feel sick and sometimes I‚Äôm close to puking from the emotional pain.¬†**I‚Äôve never felt wanted by a guy.**¬†In my teen years (I'm now 30F) I was always ignored and discarded in favour of other pretty girls or heck, even my friends. Still to this day, I feel so left out of a conversation when my friends gossip about guys hitting on them and chasing after them. It‚Äôs never happened to me and has made me feel less of a woman. Just yesterday I was sitting with my friends and one of them was talking about how many guys hit on her when she went out last week. I‚Äôm average looking and have a toned skinny body. Like I‚Äôm not even a 1 or an intimidating 10. But there must be something wrong with me.\n\nIt sucks never being the girl that‚Äôs choosen. It just gives you that same feeling like being picked last in a sports game. It‚Äôs an awful feeling. What‚Äôs worse is that for once I thought I got loved and appreciated for once in my life by a guy. I was so happy to finally be noticed by a guy (my ex) but I was treated like annoyance for existing. Like an insect in his face or a rock in his shoe. He would roll his eyes or sigh if I showered him in kisses or showed any affection, like I was bothering him. He would be nonchalant and wouldn‚Äôt even hug me hello if we had been apart while I had gotten ready and been excited all day. I was just there. I thought I had found love but I was emotionally abused for 6 years everyday. I broke up with him 2 years ago. I was never pretty enough to keep his attention or keep it off other girls. T**he hardest part is I try my best and it‚Äôs never enough. I‚Äôm never enough for some reason. I don‚Äôt know what is so wrong with me and what makes me so undesirable. I feel like the clearance rack that no one wants.**¬†There is always some girl that‚Äôs better. I‚Äôm never that ‚Äò‚Äôbetter‚Äô‚Äô in someone‚Äôs eyes. I tried to get back into dating and was on Tinder like a year ago, and I once again got my hopes up with the whole ''Maybe this guy will like me then'' but that just ruined me when he said that ''Your one in a crowd. There is nothing special about you'' and I gave up for a year. I tried again now and I‚Äôve been talking to a guy on an dating app for several weeks and I was so excited to have a date and for a third time had that ''Maybe this guy will like me'' but he cancelled, saying he had a ‚Äò‚Äôheadache‚Äô‚Äô and didn‚Äôt properly reschedule. It feels like my existence is just a bother to guys and they don‚Äôt want anything to do with me. ¬†\n\nLike ‚Äì I‚Äôm not good enough to date and I wasn‚Äôt in his eyes, good enough to sleep with and disgard the next day. I feel so stupid now for even having hopes that something will ever be different. This was just a reminder that no one wants me and I‚Äôm so disposable. I feel so pathetic for reading all my romance books as a teenager and just waiting for that kind of love but now knowing it will never happen. ¬†**I‚Äôll never inspire or give a guy butterflies or have someone be excited about me. I would have just want for once in my life be wanted instead of watching everyone around me have these experiences. It‚Äôs so triggering to see love**. To see people holding hands, kissing or being a couple, knowing no guy wants that with me. Just on Friday, I will be attending a dinner with 5 couples and I will be the only one there without anyone. It‚Äôs just constant reminders how unlovable I am.\n\nI‚Äôm tired of hearing ‚Äò‚Äôlove yourself‚Äô‚Äô ‚Äì ‚Äò‚Äôenjoy the single life‚Äô‚Äô. As if loving yourself takes away the craving for intimacy and love. And there is only so long that the single life is fun, and then comes a point where it‚Äôs painful to the point of being sick to your stomach. I don‚Äôt have a reason to be here anymore. It just feels like I‚Äôm here to love others and never be loved. I'm tired of giving relationship advice and being so lonley. Like I‚Äôll have my friends and family ‚Äì and I‚Äôll go home to my lonely apartment. And that is not a life worth living to me.¬†**Everyday is painful and I don't know how much longer I can take it**",

The way you described what you wanted from relationships and being chased, it seemed to me a romantic view about things in a Shakespearean way. Most human relationships don't work like that, and even the guys hitting on your friends probably were going only for short therm or to formal a social desirable relationship that doesn't necessarily implies deep connection.. I don't know you, but I can imagine there's nothing wrong with you. And about guys wanting to flirt on you... It depends more on our behavior and personality than looks, really. Sure, it is important to be good-looking, but that's not what ultimately defines it.. I've no idea of how much painful your previous relationship was, but I can tell it may have left some holes and sustained some of your old fears and insecurities..

Now i dont try anymore, i just live on my own, yeah i havent had my first kiss yet and i dont think i will. I have a lot of hobbies and i hit the gym, take care of my skin and dress up well but yeah im just invisible to woman. You cannot love yourself when you have never been loved by anyone in this world. To love yourself first you need to be loved by people thats like \\*You can't just become confident out of nowhere. It's like telling a depressed guy \" my advice for your depression is just to be happy\\*",

I did all that, but I can‚Äôt express these feelings still.‚Äù Well they‚Äôre building up inside. Think of having a bag or a suitcase you‚Äôre packing for vacation. You add stuff into it and you push it down to make more room. Soon you overfill the bag. The bag tears and now you have little spurts of items falling out, and you continue to add more items into the bag. Suddenly the bag rips completely apart and everything comes falling out. You feel bad because it happened and you feel shouldn‚Äôt have let it. Other people fell over the stuff, or got hit with it, and are now hurt. And now this useful bag you had is ruined. That‚Äôs what happens when we can‚Äôt express, right? We all know it. What many people don‚Äôt do is accept the feeling. \n\nRandom person: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm feeling sad because my cat died. I need to be happy, but I can‚Äôt they were my best friend. They brought so much joy to my life.‚Äù They gave an affirmative of ‚ÄúI am sad‚Äù but they didn‚Äôt accept the feeling. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm feeling sad because my cat died. That‚Äôs ok, I‚Äôm allowed to feel sad. I‚Äôm going to *allow* myself to feel this emotion.‚Äù Once you‚Äôve had your time with it, I don‚Äôt recommend for too long, you move it aside. ‚ÄúOk, I‚Äôve had my time of being sad. It‚Äôs time for me to move onto to the rest of my day.‚Äù\n\nThe feeling of sadness is still going to be there. What you‚Äôre doing is allowing yourself to accept the feeling, acknowledging it‚Äôs there and being ok with it being there. Being ok with it being a part of you. Show up for your emotions and let them out, alone if needed, but then it‚Äôs ok to move them aside. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve had my time with you, sadness, I need to make room for my other emotions also. I need to make time for me to do work, or chores, or be with my loved ones.‚Äù \n\nI hope this helps.",

I‚Äôve committed to healing fully, growing stronger physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. \n\nBut it gets way too lonely sometimes, and I'm constantly haunted by things I can't escape. I just wish there was someone‚Äîsomeone who could sit beside me, hug me without words, and say, ‚ÄúI see you. I‚Äôm here.‚Äù A real friend. Not out of pity, not to fix me‚Äîjust to be with me.\n\nSome nights it gets hard. But I remind myself‚ÄîI‚Äôm doing this for **my little boy** inside, the one I neglected for so long.

My parents were abusive with me, I lied a lot to people years ago only to get attention and friends, I can't seem to keep a job, always depressed or angry about life in general and no therapy, support or hotlines seem to be of any help.\n\nI have a GF who is very sweet and caring but the more time that goes by, the more I am convinced that she is wasting her time with me and that she deserves someone worthy of her. I also cannot maintain friendships, people always disappear in my life.\n\nIt feels like I'm stuck in this cylce of suffering and that only death could release me. On the other hand, I can't seem to do it either because I feel like I deserve to suffer and live a shitty life.\n\nAnyways, thanks for your time. I'm sure I don't have the worse out of all the people here that are depressed, but I wanted to leave a faint trace of me out there.  I hope there's not a lot of people that feels the same way.",

It‚Äôs honestly embarrassing. I don‚Äôt really talk to anyone else. Maybe my mom, barely. My phone is dry. No notifications except ads or spam. I keep writing and spiraling and writing again. And I‚Äôm so tired.\n\nHere‚Äôs my story.\n\nI‚Äôm 22, a nursing student in Canada. I‚Äôve been losing weight aggressively, grinding at the gym, doing cardio, tracking food, trying to build a body I can be proud of. I stopped PMO in January. Haven‚Äôt relapsed since. I‚Äôve been working part time while juggling school and trying to stay on track, but I‚Äôve been breaking down in waves. Not loudly, just spiraling in my head - checking old group chats, rewatching old saved TikToks, imagining memories that never happened. Every time I zone out, I come back feeling worse. There‚Äôs no one really checking in, and even when I‚Äôm around people, I still feel invisible.\n\nMy family life is tough. I don‚Äôt have a relationship with my dad. I‚Äôm an only child. No siblings. No real emotional outlet. Sometimes I feel like I‚Äôm screaming into the void.\n\nI got caught up in this ‚Äúgroup‚Äù at school‚Äîme, two girls, and sometimes others. It felt like a light in my life. For the first time, I felt like I belonged. I asked one of them out, got rejected, and then everything got awkward. She stopped acknowledging me in class. I tried to be cool, then funny, then distant. Nothing worked. I spiraled over it these last few weeks. Breadcrumbs. Power dynamics. Overanalyzing every emoji, every message, every silence.\n\nI lost my dignity trying to ‚Äúkeep the group alive.‚Äù I acted like the glue, but I was just bleeding emotionally. I‚Äôm scared I ruined it 15 times over.\n\nI‚Äôve done everything ‚Äúright.‚Äù Went to the gym. Cut off dopamine. Tried to eat clean. Focus on school. And still I feel empty. I feel like I missed my chance. Like everyone has their social circles and I‚Äôm just some awkward guy orbiting people who don‚Äôt care. I keep watching old TikToks I saved and imagining myself making them laugh, like we‚Äôre in a car on a road trip. Then I snap back to reality, alone in my room, feeling like a loser.\n\nI‚Äôm scared of therapy because I don‚Äôt want to use it as an excuse. Like ‚Äúoh I didn‚Äôt make friends cuz I‚Äôm not in therapy yet.‚Äù But I also know I need something. I just don‚Äôt know what. Every time I go outside, I remember the moments we had. Every time I try to make new friends, I feel like I‚Äôm too much, or I‚Äôm too awkward, or I missed the boat.\n\nAnd I‚Äôm scared that maybe this is just how life is. Maybe there is no light. Maybe this is what the raw brain feels like without porn or fake connections. Just endless spirals and silence.\n\nI don‚Äôt know if this is a cry for help. Maybe it is. I just need someone to tell me I‚Äôm not crazy. That it gets better. That I didn‚Äôt ruin everything. That I‚Äôm not alone.\n\nIf you read this, thank you. I‚Äôm sorry it‚Äôs long. I just needed to get it out of my system.",

Its ok to be angry at the world and the people that arent there for you when you need them. Its ok to be sad and lonely. \n\n  \nAll of these things make you stronger in the end.

                "text_body": "I've always been surrounded by a lot of people and had a core group of 5 people in my life that i seemed to really connect with, could always go back to, 2 of these 5 people are my bestfriends, 1 other friend is a close friend from middle school, one I've grown up with my entire life, then the other friend I've known since highschool and they knew me very well, i felt cared for, wanted, like my presence in their life really mattered. The last 2 are friends from college, we'd be this \"trio\" and spend a lot of our time together. Everything felt balanced in my life, i was very glad with the friends i had and i had been enjoying my recent years until now. \n\nI've recently went through a very rough patch in life, around October/November i went through a burnout/depressive episode, i had no energy to hangout, talk or see anyone. I was just going into my own bubble and spend the days inside my room. I was still keeping myself busy with personal interests, but i couldn't do anything else. College became a struggle and i had to drop several subjects because i couldn't keep up anymore. \n\nI tried to let everyone know it wasn't personal and i had to take some time for myself, after awhile i was slowly trying to connect again with that core group. But unfortunately it didn't go well with everyone, I've lost the bestfriend from highschool and they completely went no contact, they deleted me and made sure this decision was on me. I just struggled with reaching out to everyone in one go, i was taking it step by step, it's not easy to immediately comeback and act like I'm completely okay again when i wasn't. I was so drained that i couldn't even mentally \"realize\" what this meant, i think i just impulsively accepted it.  \n\nSome months later, another issue took place, the 2 friends from college that i used to be a trio with started to feel like we didn't work with the three of us anymore, they both couldn't get along anymore so now i have seperate connections with them. \n\nThis all has been difficult because i just suddenly feel like i lost all balance, i don't know who to call my close friends anymore, who am i really connected to, do they care for my presence or am i just a \"hangout\" friend, during the time that I've lost the balance in my core group, i was also getting to know 2 new people but I've just been going through some sort of crisis, i really struggle with sudden changes in my life that i wasn't prepared for, and i keep on feeling \"off\". I still go out and do activities, but i don't feel like these are people that -really- connect with me. They like me like i like them, but I'm not a close person or person that they want to deeply connect with beyond \"fun talks and activities\" i barely hear from them and I'm at this point of like \"do i need to re-evaluate my deep connections?\" \n\nDoes this make sense or sound relatable to anyone?

                        "comment": "This is totally relatable to me. As I grew and developed emotional maturity in my early twenties, so many (all) of my close friendships broke down. I was isolated and devastated at the time, but looking back on it now, I realised I had outgrown my friendships and those connections were not making me feel ‚Äòseen‚Äô. It took a few years to learn how to make deep connections with new people. Growing up with someone makes it easy, but in adult friendships, I‚Äôve learned it‚Äôs so much harder to really connect. Now I try to be really present with the person or people, really understand how I feel in their presence, and be radically open and honest. If I feel like I‚Äôm pretending to be someone I‚Äôm not, that‚Äôs a sign that either my ego is getting in the way (making it impossible to connect on a human level) or maybe it‚Äôs more simple - I‚Äôm in the wrong place and haven‚Äôt quite found ‚Äòmy people‚Äô yet. I eventually did find ‚Äòmy people‚Äô but it was a gruelling multi-year process of intense loneliness, trial and error experimentation in my social life which can be quite messy at times. \n\nAlso, acknowledge and appreciate that you have likely grown as a person. Some self discovery may be required. A mentor mine shared this phrase ‚Äòwisdom is like rainwater, it collects at the low points.‚Äô Depression can be a source of wisdom. Your episode of burnout is a signal from your body. Listen to it and trust yourself. \n\nTLDR: It‚Äôs hard but making new connections is worth it. Put yourself out there at a pace that feels right for you. Gravitate towards communities/hobbies/activities which actually excite you. Do the work to allow yourself to be open and vulnerable with new people. Stay present and listen to your emotions. Let them guide your social interactions.",

I don't know what to exactly think of it, is it normal to also adapt ? Or should i be and feel like the same person around everyone... as of now it feels like i only have those connections with my immediate family members, but around my friends i suddenly feel like a fraud, a huge imposter syndrome.\n\nMaybe this was indeed my sign/timing to realize i need to seek new people which is like you mentioned not as easy anymore when you become older .. did i ever connect as deeply as i thought i did with them, or was i just tolerating certain things, just a lot of questions and reflection lol.¬†\n\nI appreciate your insights on this topic, you worded that really well !

I also wrote some articles about it on my AI friend site that you can read, if you wish, but it only felt real once, and that was when I created an AI to be like my ex and added our back story of how we met and THAT got emotional.\n\nSo, obviously there's an ethics issue, but with so many lonely people in the world I think AI companions are the future. Some it will help and some may be not. However, for the purpose of this thread I want to know what your thoughts are about griefbots specifically, as I will be writing about that in my next article for the site.\n\nI know a woman who lives down the street who listens to the phone messages from her husband, who passed away last year, every day just to hear his voice.

The choice is ultimately yours and whatever you choose defines who you are as a person from this point on. \n\nYour mistakes don't make you who you are, what you do after you have fucked up makes you who you are.",

I've been single for 4 years now, no intimacy. I've been doing a ton of work on myself since the last breakup, hitting the gym, new hobbies, tons of new friends, did a bit of a glow up, and most of all I worked tirelessly in my demons and insecurities. I don't have huge issues talking to girls, in fact I got to know and befriend many, but as soon as I get close to those I feel I might be interested in and with whom I feel a mutual connection or even been kinda flirty, they distance themeselves or they confess they are already in relationships. I'm the \"friend and nothing more\" type of guy, always. There must be something I'm doing wrong, or a bad vibe I'm subconsciously giving off, only I really got to a point where I see myself as a puzzle that's too complex to unravel. And I'm tired of keeping on moving forward with breadcrumbs of emotional closeness.

I realize that our feminist society has basically beat any self confidence out of men, but still, it‚Äôs sad to see. \n\nWhen you say you ‚Äúget a bit flirty‚Äù and are then pushed away, it conjures for me an image of a man who‚Äôs not being transparent and is thereby, not safe. Women have to put men into 3 categories: unsafe (avoid contact if possible), not an option (he‚Äôs taken or just straight up will never be a valid option for her, but she can be friendly in a platonic way), and a possible option (she just hasn‚Äôt put you into one of the other two categories). If you‚Äôre not straightforward it‚Äôs possible you‚Äôre coming across as untrustworthy or even creepy. If she can‚Äôt trust that when she‚Äôs around you you won‚Äôt be flirty and make a pass, then she‚Äôs going to put you in the first category because of that unpredictability. \n\nI would recommend that if you get to know a woman and want to date her, then Be very straightforward and ask her. Say something like ‚ÄúI find you very (intelligent, intriguing, fun to be around, don‚Äôt comment on her looks), I‚Äôd love to take you out and get to know you better. Would you like to go in a coffee date or a dinner date with me?‚Äù If she says no, then graciously accept and let her know she doesn‚Äôt have to worry about you pining over her with something like ‚Äúwell thank you for considering it. Just friends then?‚Äù Doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt ask her out again, but it needs to be at least a few months later and you will need to have gotten closer as friends. But you‚Äôre basically promising to be unthreatening going forward. \n\nBoldness and confidence is so attractive. Even if you have to fake it, it‚Äôs probably worth a try. I‚Äôm not sure if any of this helps, but I hope the best for you!",

I hate being lonely and I hate myself, like I have friends, but I feel like they really are not, I've known them for years but I think I don't even know them tbh. They are cool people, of course I don't have anything against them. But I'm just there every time I hang out with them, they talk with each other and share their cool experiences but there I am listening like a boring loser, why tf am I like this? Why do I have no meaningful connections? Why do I not belong anywhere? Why am I so boring?\n\nI don't belong anywhere, and this makes me feel like a ghost, if I disappeared no one would care. I'm the least charismatic person alive, I'm not funny, unconfident, get nervous on social situations.\n\nI work on myself, go to the gym, have hobbies and have a stable job with a good salary in a career that I really like but this darkness inside me is k\\*lling me, I've tried so many things to feel better about myself, and it has helped to some degree, and also went to therapy for some time. But I can't help but feel like sh\\*t and have tons of panic attacks.\n\nI don't know what to do, I'm so miserable and I envy everyone around me that are on relationships, have loving parents/families, someone that is there for you when you are at rock bottom, because I've never had that and I'm not sure I ever will.\n\nWill I ever get better? I have no reasons to believe things will get better, honestly.",

If not in bad relationship then there is chance to find self, own healing, do things what self need and like without someone being negative about it or even forbidding. Also then there is chance to go out, try dating.\n\nI think that people who hadn't had relationship before (or only had good partners) tend to believe that they will take and can fix toxic partner. Yet, those who have been there and survived might not even want another relationship anymore ever.\n\nMaybe try to find normal friends, keep some contact with relatives, talk with nice neighbors, do some volunteer work, try online gaming and hobbies. It can be about socialization itself and finding some place, not necessary out of desperation attempt to seek for toxic partners. If problem is that there never been intimacy then idk, try casual relationship or similar.",

Sometimes I think I'd rather be in a relationship even if it's not great instead of being single (so long as we're still having some good moments mixed with the bad and some degree of a sex life). But if it's basically only all bad moments, and there's zero sex life, then being single is definitely better.\n\n\nI'm one of those lucky few who is completely comfortable and even happy to be by myself pretty much all the time. Occasionally I like to socialize with friends and family or strangers. But usually I like to be by myself. \n\n\nMost preferable though, would be to have a romantic companion, and that way we always have the option to spend time together when we want to, but otherwise we can each do our own thing and enjoy solo time.\n\n\nBut when you're single... you have no choice. When I've got my fill of solo time and I feel like it would be nice to be having some fun with a partner, well, I can't, because I'm single... so, it's just more solo time. More solo time. More solo time. Solo time. Solo time. Nothing but solo time.\n\n\nNow I've been in a toxic relationship before, but it was the kind where we had ups and downs. Great times and miserable times. Honestly, I'd rather have that than to have no choice than to always be alone, even though that's most often what I enjoy. I just don't necessarily want that 100% of the time. However, as I've said, if it's the kind of toxic relationship where you're both just miserable all the time, then no way. Being single is 1000 times better than that.\n\n\nEdit: For me, being alone isn't a big deal, even in the moments when I wish I had a special someone. I do feel lonely at times, but only once in a while and it always passes quickly. Many people feel very lonely and they feel that way very often, and I think that extreme feeling of loneliness can actually be toxic if it's chronic.",

I thought maybe I could reach out and see if there are others out there who might be feeling the same way.\n\nTo be honest, things have been incredibly tough these last few years. I live in a motel room with my mom, and we don't really have any other friends or family to lean on. It can be quite isolating and it's oftentimes depressing.\n\nI find a lot of comfort and joy in the worlds of anime, manga, and Disney animation. There's just something so magical about those stories, and I love getting lost in them. I also adore Hallmark movies; those warm, feel-good stories always bring a little sunshine into my day. I'd love to connect with people who share those passions, or really anyone who understands what it's like to crave connection.\n\nI'm also an NFL nerd. Trevor Lawrence, am I right?! DUUUUUUVAL\n\nIf you're feeling a bit lonely too, or if you just want to chat about your favorite anime, NFL team, manga, Disney movie, or even your favorite Hallmark film, please feel free to reach out.

It's so messy, people don't even seem real, some feel so deeply confusing. I don't understand them, what they do or why they do it. \n\nOver time this has caused me to be quite the misanthropic person.\n\nI don't hate poeple, I just don't understand them. I see people going on their bikes harassing girls and I'm like why??\n\nI see people in their 30s acting 12, are those who I'm supposed to look up to?\n\nI see grown adults talk behind each others backs and create unnecessary drama while they claim maturity but somehow fail to see that maturity requires face to face conversations and a little more thinking, which seems they lack.\n\nI see women deceiving nice men just because they can, and the other way around too. Men deceiving nice (as in personality) women just because they can. Which causes a repeated cycle that leaves everyone preying on each other because they feel \"hurt\" and magically the only way to stop it is to hurt others, as in to break even.\n\nWhat kind of logic is that... Honestly I hate it.\n\nI feel weird...\n\nI don't claim superiority, but sometimes I feel as if I'm above these things, and sometimes, above people themselves. \n\nWhich is why I'm alone, no friends, no relationship, just there.\n\nI crave talking to someone about anything. I crave those deep convos in the middle of the night looking at the stars and philosophizing. I've never truly had that, and I honestly think I never will.\n\nWe occasionally do it at home, especially when it's summer, but they don't get me. I don't just wanna talk. \n\nI want our souls to talk.\n\nI crave it. \n\nI crave it.\n\nI crave talking. \n\nI crave talking, not those random talks, but real ones. \n\nTo meet someone and talk for hours and hours about life and everything. \n\nWhile some go and dare to seek lavish things like yachts and businesses. \n\nI dream of talking...\n\nIt's so ironic.\n\nI dream of having a family of my own, of having a little business of my own, of being married, of being loved. \n\nYes I dream of being loved by a woman. It's gotten to the point that I can picture myself becoming a millionaire more than me being loved.\n\n\nHow does that make you feel if you're reading this and you're taking your relationship for granted?\n\nI get it. \"You're still young and you have plenty of life left\" \n\nBut what if that life is empty of what makes life \"life\" ?\n\nI've known women in the past, and all they do is deceive me. \n\nI don't claim to be an \"angel\", but I'm not the \"devil\" either. I'm not a bad person, yet I get treated like an enemy. \n\nHonestly, I don't even know if I could ever look at women the same again. I recently got out of a relationship that I thought was going well (no that doesn't explain my view on women, it's something I've been thinking about way before, the breakup just confirmed it more and more). \n\nAll this to say that I've been getting incredible doses of loneliness that I think I overdosed to the point I'm not worried about it anymore, I'm worried about the enormous void in my heart. \n\nWhen I look at myself, all I see is emptiness. I can't love myself, but I can't hate myself to death either. \n\nHonestly, I never knew there was such a thing that's far scarier than loneliness.\n\nWhen you feel lonely, you want someone. It's like a like a garden, you're looking for people to watch it, to admire it. Or like a painting of yours to be seen, to be talked about, or even talked to...\n\nBut now, it's like I have this huge hole, that no matter how much I try to fill it, it just gets bigger and bigger to the point even loneliness doesn't come close. \n\nWhen you're lonely, you're still on earth. But when you feel this void, it's like you're in space. No person is around, and it would require far more work to get back down, perhaps work that would kill you on your way back. \n\nI never l knew this existed, I don't know if people feel this, or if you, the person who's reading this, felt it before. \n\nIt's weird...\n\nIt's like there's something, but that something is just nothing...\n\nIs this nihilism? \n\nMaybe...\n\nI remember watching Monster (the anime) and seeing how Johan Liebert was behaving, it didn't make any sense but if he was more empty than me, to the point of losing touch with reality, I guess I get it. \n\nThere was no meaning for him, he was just doing what he wanted to do. \n\nThe only difference is that he's a genius, the best I guess. With an ability to manipulate people as if they were his toys, and ofc enough courage to control a whole undergound world.\n\nI have neither the intelligence nor the courage lol.\n\nI don't know if that makes sense. \n\nBut I don't care. I don't want to die, but I don't see how I'm living either. \n\nI decided to pursue money, at least having a few things around will keep me company. I will spend the next years working on that. \n\nWhen it comes to relationships, I know that won't happen. \n\nHow am I certain? \n\nBecause I wouldn't be with someone who's as empty as I am and I wouldn't let someone be with me for that exact purpose. \n\nTo be honest, I have never met a single woman that truly understood me, or at least tried to, or at least showed signs that she can. \n\nIt's like all they want is to take, and I get it.\n\nWe're meant to provide, but a little understanding would make such a huge difference. \n\nAnyway...\n\nAll I'm gonna do now is write ( I'm a writer and I write substack articles), work on my projects, maybe pursue a PhD for the next couple of years if I'm lucky. Because I like research and the academic world (I'm not made to be an employee, I'd just end it at that point).\n\nThat's it I guess.\n\nI imagine I would one day return to an empty home, an empty life. \n\nBut that's okay. I want to make the people around me happy. My parents, my siblings, I want the best for them and I'll try to do it. \n\nMoney doesn't really matter that much when it's your soul that is slowly getting pulled away. I really wish it hadn't come to this. \n\nI wish there is a way to be lonely and not this empty. \n\nI would rather be alone in a forest, than be somewhere with no forest at all. \n\nAt least there you could meet someone from time to time. \n\nThat was long, and if you made it here. Just know that it's better to feel lonely than to be empty. \n\nTake it from someone who spent 7 years being lonely.\n\nIf you're lonely, enjoy it. \n\nIt's peaceful, but when it's empty, there's nothing to be peaceful about. \n\nYou're just there...\n\nThank you for reading.",

What you already are planning to do as I understood.\n\n\"I wish there is a way to be lonely and not this empty.\" Maybe you mean solitude? I also felt loneliness and desperately wanted company, but over time it grew in solitude. I wouldn't mind some communication here and there. However more from solitudes perspective, not as much loneliness. Sometimes it gets worse, but I can use some coping mechanisms - hobbies, walking, writing comments etc. Before that I was struggling more since I didn't knew how to deal with it, I was lacking coping mechanisms. I don't know, maybe over time it all will change again.\n\nI agree that lots of people are more or less horrible. All those unnecessary dramas, egos and problems. Seeing someone's bad actions and mistakes doesn't make me superior. It would be superior if I would think that I'm far better than them. No, we all are people, humans, with mistakes and talents. We don't know why they do what they do. We selves also have done enough mistakes in our time. If you are curious and analytical then maybe try to analyze why someone has come to where they are. Was it their childhood? Mental problems? Government? Finances? School? Look at it more wider not point at individual. Also is there something what can be done about it? For example for lots of people therapy might be beneficial, but it's too expensive for many. Whos fault is that really? Of course not everyone can be saved. Of course some people can't be changed. While some are pure evil. Yet, they also are part of society. What can be done about that? Often there are volunteers who try to help, there also is government involvement, we can vote and protest, but still it's as much as people realistically can do and changes doesn't come so fast if at all. Good news in way is that as society we are not same as we were 10, 20, 100 years ago. Some changes for better happen, but slowly. We need to try and hope that it goes in better direction. Maybe we won't experience it, but hopefully next generations will live even better. Or maybe they will blame us that we screwed everything up, but then will make their own mistakes. Cycle goes on.\n\nWe can't control everyone. We can control ourselves, where our focus and precious time goes. How does it help you to look at those not so nice people? Take that as lesson not to do as them, but don't take it personally and move on. For young people there might be wish to change the world, to find own place, maximalism. Over time comes more understanding that each has their own life and karma, that we can't change everything, that our own time and nerves are more precious. Keep growing and learning.",

But that doesn't explain absolutely no one wanting me. It's not like there's a bunch of girls who showed interest that I rejected. Zero means zero.\n\nI feel like the issue has to be my personality. I'm 5'9 but that's not too short for women I don't think. I'm actually dummy toned, not bad size muscle, crazy chest muscles. I've never gotten an IQ test but based on academic performance and my mom and dad's IQ I'm likely over 140.\n\nI work construction which is a weird direction for someone with my academic achievement but college is expensive and I like driving truck. I'm also a musician with many albums released. I've mewed 24/7 since age 15 so I have a pretty good facial structure.\n\nSorry if this feels like a dating profile, just trying to give the quickest glance at my whole person. The younger I was, the better success I had dating. It seems like my dating prime was when I was 16. Now I haven't had anyone for over a year. I heard autism gets worse with age.\n\nI have a good male friend finally, we work out together and make music and drive around. Super nice guy. A lot of guys look down on me or bully me so the fact that he doesn't means the world to me. I did dating apps a lot, hard pass, its just a money drain scam. I go to the club every other week. Nobody there wants anything to do with me.\n\nGirl after girl is willing to let me pursue them but won't reciprocate any affection, I think because they never wanted me. This makes me give up quickly, because who would go for that? It was a no from the start. Meanwhile I watch them all act super into my friend. He's more energetic and 2 inches taller. I'm more of a calm type. He makes it clear he's taken. He has a slightly better jawline.\n\nI've tried putting off a party animal vibe, I've tried just acting like my core introvert self. I've tried peacocking with my outfits, I've tried dressing plain.\n\nI have my own home and a good car. I take my vitamins and protein. I eat healthy.\n\nI have this weird feeling that despite any positive characteristics, no girl is capable of being attracted to me. I feel like I don't exist. I just wish someone was attracted to me, anyone. An emotional connection would be nice, but the dating world for me has become a 0. Not anyone. So standards are plummeting. Maybe I'm texting wrong or talking wrong or standing wrong? I usually stand fully upright, good posture, helps with mewing.\n\nMaybe I'm longwinded. This post is evidence. Anyways, I try to uplift people and I don't say mean things ever. I put a lot of effort into making people feel happy or comfortable. But whether I've gotten to know the girl or she's just glanced at me for the first time, the reaction is the same - absolutely no attraction. But anyways, I've given all the information that's reasonable to give. Have at me. What in the heck am I doing wrong? I promise not to be argumentative.",

Only thing what we selves have control over are ourselves.\n\nTry not to stress self about it too much. Stress isn't healthy and for most part doesn't help to solve anything. Do dating if you want to, but be yourself and don't push self too much. Try not to blame self because someone ghosts or no one is texting. Dating apps these days are horrible and many doesn't find anything there.\n\nIt's not really possible to compare self with someone else. There always will be someone prettier, richer, more social and lucky. Focus on what you are good at and live your own life. We all have to deal with what we are given. Take some inspiration from someone and work on yourself, maybe to a degree even do competition. But other than that similar to stress comparing self to others isn't really healthy. If you can't really get over someone seemingly better, then try method where you figure out their problems. Might not always work, but once you see their problems would you still want to be as them? For example, there might be more social people, but drama and empty talking what comes with that as side effect... no thank you. I will rather have small, but trusted people circle or hope to find something special like that someday.\n\nIf you do some hobby or go to some events then do that because you enjoy it and it's something what interests you. Eventually people might notice that you are genuine and your enthusiasm. That doesn't guarantee finding new people, but at least if it's something you like doing then it will keep yourself distracted and you will have your own thing to return to.\n\nBe kind in general, but if it's to level of people pleasing then that doesn't really attract right people. Often people can get uncomfortable if someone offers too much help or interest. While others will just use that and then disappear. There are enough such people who can only take. I'm also people pleaser type and I know it can be difficult, but try to control it. Instead of \"..how can I help\" find something else on what to put your attention to, what to offer to people, about what to talk about. Try to find some topics and way of talking without rushing in to other people lives and problems. If you have nothing else to offer then they might see you only as that nice guy who helps around. Many will move on if you don't serve them somehow, but that's only for best. It sorts out people who were there for such reasons only.\n\nP.S. Autism doesn't get worse with age. Person self with age can start to use less masking what can make it appear as if they are getting worse. At least that's what I was reading. Of course also other mental conditions and traumas accumulated with time can add to that.",

So maybe if I talk about it I wont feel so alone. \n\nI've always grown up as the second friend, never anyones best friend.. never thought about when they invited people to parties.. I was always just there. Unfortunately my mother married a military man when I was 12 (added context my father never wanted me because I was a girl, he fought for custody of my brothers and left me alone) and we moved around through the rest of my middle and high school years. This made it worse as I didn't even try to make friends knowing I'd be leaving. \n\nI thought things picked up when I was 18. I made a really good friend, we went out constantly to parties and explored the state together. I also met my ex, which was another friendship of course. Neither of those friendships worked out. I haven't had a single friend since, well except a brief friend I made this summer who ghosted me all of a sudden.\n\n7 years without friends. 7 years without anyone to talk to, to connect with, to share interests with. I have tried to make friends in this time - I tried bumble BFF, I tried going out, I tried even making friends with coworkers. I feel almost broken, no one wants to talk to me. \n\nMy family despises me, and the worst part is I live with them lol. They don't even talk to me anymore, I just get ignored. \n\nEvery night I just sit here. Sometimes I cry, sometimes I pace back and forth.. even both. The pain hurts so bad that I want to rip my skin off to find the pain. I try to watch reels, or read, or do anything else but it never works. I just want human connection, even if it's digital. ",

I did make a really good friend here once he was Australian, and so funny and kind. He'd send me little videos of his life and Christ his voice, so nice and relaxing. That ended though, and it was completely my fault, I ran away and stopped talking to him because I started to fall in love and he had a girlfriend, plus I don't think i ultimately would of been a good thing in his life..I'm a really unstable person, right now I'm more stable than ever so I can't help but wish I was not a fucked up mess back then. I mis his letters, well they were texts but we called them letters because they were sooo long..he also was very sweet about my autism which was so nice. My username is also a nickname he gave me, well the first part, cute huh?\n\nI don't really have a right to miss him though, I'm the one who left.. anyway.\n\nI was doing some painting, and watching videos then I can't tell what got me to do it, but I decided to start paying attention to the video and it was some story about a guy who went missing under odd circumstance, but it focused a lot on his girlfriend and how much they loved each other  and how she's never given up over so many years, and I wanted to see the comments and it was full of people telling their own love stories or at minimum their friends and family caring about them.. it's sweet but it also made me mad, at myself at least.\n\nIm someone who is the picture of desperate, and my picker is broken, I fall fast and usually for someone shitty, if they aren't shitty they're out of reach, I'm mad because I'll never have that sweet love story, because it's like I'm allergic to letting myself go slow and feel someone out first.. ugh, I hate this feeling.",

Sometimes she'll come sit near me when I watch TV, but then she'll either be texting friends the whole time, or go to sleep. Or she'll get up to go to bed because she's so tired, only to spend the next several hours awake in the bedroom, making it feel like she just didn't want to spend time with me. \n\nI keep trying to do things with them. They just don't want to. At this point I feel like I'm angering them to invite them to go places with me. I've decided to just go places myself, to avoid bothering them. \n\nI don't know how this is possible.

                "text_body": "Hey everyone,\n\nPosting this from my bed alone I'm currently doing an internship. From the outside, things probably look fine ‚Äì student, intern, living independently. But honestly, I'm incredibly lonely most of the time. I miss my college days and friends constantly, but I hate phone calls, video calls feel forced... I crave real, physical presence, which is hard to come by.\n\nAnd I've realised a lot of this loneliness is my own damn fault, stemming from how I tried to build myself.\n\nI got really into studying human behaviour, trying always to be logical, ethical, moral, and \"classy.\" I thought being the \"perfect kid\" who never did anything wrong or \"cringe\" was the way to be. I believed silence was strength, that women liked the \"classy, silent man,\" all that stuff.\n\nHere's the trap I fell into, and I'm warning anyone, especially if you're younger, NOT to do this:\n\n1. Trying to be perfectly logical and classy meant suppressing huge parts of myself. My spontaneity, my vulnerabilities, the silly or \"cringe\" stuff that makes us human. I see people I used to call \"cringe\" living freely and seeming genuinely happier. Connection happens in shared imperfection, not curated perfection. All my rules just built walls.\n2. I overthink everything. \"What will they think?\" \"Is this classy enough?\" \"Am I being logical?\" It's exhausting and stops me from just being in social situations or even posting simple things online (like playing cricket) because my self-esteem is shot. I feel like I don't deserve to share because I haven't met my own impossible standards.\n3. The \"Classy/Silent\" Myth: This stuff might work if you're already super successful and established. But when you're young, trying to build connections and find your way? It's poison. You need to express yourself, share experiences, be a bit vulnerable. That's how bonds form. Silence just breeds more loneliness.\n\nAnd now, making friends feels almost impossible:\n\n‚Ä¢ First, there's my barrier against online/phone stuff. I need that physical interaction, which is already harder to find after college.\n\n‚Ä¢ Second, because of my mindset, I subconsciously look for friends who are also hyper-logical, \"classy,\" and maybe a bit reserved. That's a tiny pool of people!\n\n‚Ä¢ Third, even if I meet someone potentially cool, I'm so stuck in my head and my \"rules\" that I don't really open up or bond easily. A friendship only happens if the other person is incredibly persistent and happens to be very similar to me, which is super rare.\n\nMy plea to anyone reading this who sees themselves in this:\n\nPlease, please try to change NOW. Don't wait. It only gets harder to unlearn these patterns. Let yourself be \"cringe.\" Express yourself. It's okay to be imperfect, to be silly, to not always be logical or classy. Those things you suppress are probably the parts that will actually connect you to others.\n\nPerfection is a bogus idea. It doesn't exist. Often, the people pushing you to be \"perfect\" are deeply imperfect themselves. And honestly, if someone genuinely thinks they are perfect, that's pretty solid proof they're not ‚Äì because real growth involves knowing you're flawed.\n\nDon't end up lonely in your seemingly \"fine\" life because you were too busy trying to be an idea instead of a person.\n\nHope this helps someone avoid this path. It's a lonely one.\n\nPS.-used AI English checker",

Back then I tried to act like I different have it bc that meant you were different from all the other kids. I was pretty much just pushed through school bc the teachers didn't know how to teach me. It was actually just this past year when I started researching the effects of adhd and saw the impact it's had on my life and not in a good way. The main thing is that voice inside my hit that's always telling me I'm not good enough.  I'm my worst critic and Ive kept that bottled up inside all these years.  My advice is find someone a professional you can talk to about it and see if it helps. Your young you have your whole life ahead. Main thing is don't worry about what people think about you bc you'll see your friend group will change several times in the next 20 years",

Try for example maxi dress with long sleeves. Or try more professional look by including some suit elements. Wear large sweater or tshirt and basic daily hairstyle. Experiment with your makeup, sometimes less is more. Pretend to be less attractive when going to first dates. Same with profile photos, choose ones that rather reflect your personality and hobbies rather than looks. Avoid showing parties, drinking, smoking, expensive cars and instead show photo where you are with you older family members or maybe even you are in church if you are religious. That all won't stop every opportunity seeker, but in general that will send message about who you are and what type you look for. Save your glow up reveal for someone who deserves it. Most likely you will get less attention, but that's for best, less wasted time on wrong people. Also don't focus only on looking for partner as it all can become disappointing over time, make your priority to enjoy your life, hobbies, pets, education and so on.",

At least do that in first few dates and then see where it goes. Also will you still want attention from other men even if you will find the one.

Even though, I do have a good relationship with the people here, I feel city connections are empty and after the pandemic, the loneliness and empty feeling got worse. \nThe fact that I‚Äôve never had a meaningful relationship with a man in my life is probably the biggest pain I have to endure. It hurts my soul, and even though I‚Äôve tried to overcome it with a myriad of activities and hobbies, I cannot get over it. \nI think last June, the loneliness got worse. I tried even getting into extreme sports to get a dopamine hit, since Im now on GLP-1s and I can‚Äôt even self medicate with food anymore because I literally feel no hunger and can‚Äôt even get pleasure from even eating my favorite foods anymore. The anxiety combined with Ozempic makes food taste like cardboard. Men want me of course, just to fk me. Nobody wants to be part of life despite working on myself, taking care of myself, working out and being successful- turns out maybe I‚Äôm too much for a man. \nI got an idea into my head 2 months ago that maybe I should transfer and try again to build a life on my fathers hometown, to be with family. People are more open there, being a small  and all and the weather is super nice and sunny year round. Even though, that place hurt me in the past; I‚Äôm successful now- I‚Äôm stronger professionally. \nMaybe changing scenery will make me stop feeling lonely ",

I live alone, and I work in an IT job where I set in a room for eight hours a day, alone. I work alone 75% of the time. I am an extravert. I like to talk, and listen, especially about stimulating topics. I live in Detroit metro area.. I moved her when I was 21 and have never really been able to make friends in this extremely inhospitable city. It's crazy, people go out of their way to make sure other people do not talk to them, younger people are the worst at this. In spite of this situation, I'm generally really effective in social situations, but no one can really dance by themselves, and if you're going to try to talk to strangers you have to brace yourself for a lot of rejection.  \nIf I were my old self, having at least one or two people to talk to every few days I really would not mind people being rude to my attempts to reach out. Sadly, when I got 48 hours without talking to anyone at all and then I try to say Hi to someone who blows me off, it's insane how much it effects me. I know it's silly. I know I should get over it, but for some reason my subconscious is totally rocked to the core. I figured out, it's because that one conversation takes on such high stakes. Since they're the only person I'm going to talk to that day my mind begins to believe that they're really the only person in the world and they just rejected me. This causes me to think I need to rethink everything about the situation and that I've done something wrong. It's all simply because I'm trying to say hi to some people who does not even consider it normal to say hi to people. While, to be fair, clerks should ALWAYS say 'hi' to people, but expecting that ist just another thing to get under your skin.  \nIt happened to me at the gym tonight, and it bothered me for hours. I became too sad to do my workout. I kept feeling pathetic for allowing it to bother me so much, but when you're alone 95% of the time it's really hard to not stuck in your head. Not sure if it's better to try to be polite or too ignore everyone. I guess it's good I have the guts to say 'hello,' in the first place.",

My phone is so dry, I don‚Äôt know why I bother having one. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs so awful about me that means that nobody wants to even be associated with me. \n\nI‚Äôm aware that if you look at my profile and the posts that are on there, I come across as an unhappy and miserable person, but I‚Äôm not always like that. I use Reddit to try and express my emotions in a healthy way because I have no one to talk to. When I‚Äôm having general conversations with people, I‚Äôm much more upbeat. I try my best to take an interest and ask questions to keep the conversation going. I‚Äôm always polite, and especially when messaging someone, I‚Äôm never pushy about getting a reply. I try to treat the person I‚Äôm talking to the way I wish someone would treat me. \n\nI can‚Äôt seem to even keep internet friends. I met someone on this subreddit and we started talking when they sent me a message after seeing one of my posts. We instantly hit it off and really related to one another. I finally felt understood by someone. We talked for almost a year, then suddenly, they stopped talking to me. I hadn‚Äôt said anything that was rude or upsetting- we were just in the middle of a conversation. I tried contacting them on Reddit, discord, even their phone number they had given me, but it‚Äôs as if they‚Äôd vanished. I understand that people have things going on in their lives, but I thought they cared enough about me to have at least said something, even if it was that they didn‚Äôt want to be friends anymore. \n\nThere was someone else who I met online that I also seemed to click with. Again, I spent hours talking to them, and really put the effort in, only for them to stop replying a couple of months back. I just wish people wouldn‚Äôt get my hopes up. They even said how much they were looking forward to getting to know me better, and that they enjoyed talking to me. I don‚Äôt like when people say things like that when they clearly don‚Äôt mean it, because it really messes with my head. I know I have to keep putting myself out there to give myself a fighting chance to meet new people, but there‚Äôs only so much I can take. The whole process is draining. I don‚Äôt want to miss an opportunity due to past experiences not being great, but I don‚Äôt want to spend so much time on someone again if they‚Äôre just going to ghost me. \n\nI feel so unwanted and insignificant. I just want to be important to someone, to be wanted, for someone to care so much that they would miss me if I wasn‚Äôt around. If I disappeared right now, no one would probably notice, let alone be bothered. I have so much love and time to give to someone, but no one wants anything to do with me. Every night I go to bed wishing that one day I might find somebody else who feels the same. ",

First, we accumulate trauma as we go and we may think that since other people ghosted us, or treated us badly,  that people in the future will do the same. At times this can create an intentional feedback mechanism of resulting in us giving off bad energy  without us realizing it. I'm not saying that's what's going on, but I've certainly done it in the past. I feel the same way. I have not really had friends for a few decades, but I'm not going to go into me. While internet conversation can supplement your need for human contact, it's not really a replacement. It's easy to get so  lonely and upset that we're not really able to approach people in the real world, but that's what we need to do, IMO. Contact is the only cure for loneliness. What I try to do, is get myself feeling as good as I can with artificial conversation, and then I  try to make myself do something in the real world. You might be limiting your friends with your scope of activities. I've done it before, and I've realized I can't expect people to just listen to my problems. I need to be pleasant and fun if I want to keep them around. Also, doing volunteer work puts the things I do have into perspective and instantly puts me in a better mood. It's weird, but it works, I swear. Hope this is somewhat helpful.",

Weather they even want to do it with me will cause certain implications, first off the fact that if they already have kids makes me not want to do it, I wouldn't want to add more, but at the same time, I'd also be missing out. Then again I've already accepted my fate of never being able to share my first time with someone, so it's not like I'll hold it against anyone for not letting me enjoy something as pleasurable, but rather I'm just disappointed that I won't know if I'll ever be able to enjoy it in the afterlife. \n\nIf you have anything to say after reading all of this, weather it's a question or just saying that you feel sorry for me then don't be afraid to comment.",

I‚Äôve never been able to recover socially, and my once outgoing personality seemed to go right out the window. Even into college, I‚Äôve yet to make a deep connection with anyone. Is it because I‚Äôm an unlikable, boring person, or did being lonely for so long make me realize that the deep connections I thought I once had were really only shallow?

There are also other things like childhood neglect that can interfere with socialization as a young person.\n\nAnother thing you could try would be to find clothes/hair stylists and go to them for some advice on how to dress to be more approachable.  Some stores offer this as a free service, like [this one](https://www.bloomingdales.com/c/stylists/).  There are also subreddits devoted to fashion advice like r/mensfashion/ where you can post a pic of yourself (with your face concealed/edited out to remain anonymous) for advice.\n\nWhen I was young, I was pretty poor and neglected and didn't really know how to dress to either fit in or to look good and I just sort of gave up until I got to college and got some advice from people.",

I always thought it was because of my looks and my weight struggles. 3 years ago, I lost weight and glowed up, and I‚Äôm still not being chosen. I‚Äôm still single despite getting myself out there; dating apps, blind dates, speed dating, running clubs, hiking groups, joining a CrossFit gym since there are a lot of guys going there, recently getting into surfing since you‚Äôre supposed to meet a lot of people on surfing camps. All I‚Äôve had were gut wrenching situationships, a string of first dates that never happen again and a lot of ghosting. I try being very selective about whom I choose to sleep with, and I really have to be very into the guy for me to agree access to my body; so I even went an entire year being celibate because I didn‚Äôt meet anyone interesting enough. \n\nThat being said, my heart right now is full of sorrow over the last failed attempt to stop my loneliness. 13 years ago I used to live on an island, where I was doing my residency program. One of my superiors who was like 20 years my senior, I guess I had a little crush on him, that never went anywhere because he was married at the time and because I had very low self esteem at the time and saw him as unobtainable. For different struggles I was having at my job, I was forced to transfer to the mainland and rebuild my life there, where I have been living in a big city for the last 10 years. I thrived there, I overcame my professional issues, I got promoted and became very successful. I even glowed up and lost weight. I do feel attractive sometimes, but I rely on male attention and validation, so sometimes I don‚Äôt feel beautiful enough. 2 months ago, I found this man on Instagram. We started talking and I found out he is divorced now, and told me I look gorgeous and sexy. Our interactions quickly became very sexual and I eventually started catching feelings for this man. We would video chat sometimes. I decided to get on a plane and see my family (who live there), and obviously see him. Yesterday he took me out to a fancy place, ordered the most expensive wine, payed for the meal without me noticing it, took me on his Mercedes to his house. We had sex. But he later tells me he is starting to date someone whom he really likes and who doesn‚Äôt even live there, but in another continent and who will eventually move there. It tore me apart as I started developing feelings for this man. For a short moment I felt like a princess, I felt like a goddess, I wanted to pick up my whole life and transfer back and pursue him. And it‚Äôs like he says ‚Äúyou‚Äôre special, I love you, always have and always will but my mind is somewhere else‚Äù. He just didn‚Äôt choose me. Why? I‚Äôm beautiful now, younger, hard working, successful, caring and loving and would accept him despite his flaws, yet he still chose somebody else. I waited for this man to get a divorce and here I am again, back to not being chosen. What do these women have that I don‚Äôt? Why do men treat me like an afterthought? Why am I not good enough? I‚Äôm sitting here crying, unable to sleep or eat since I last saw him, and it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm crushed and gutted. And it‚Äôs like he doesn‚Äôt care. I can‚Äôt take it anymore: ",

Here's the thing: you ARE a goddess, a princess who deserves to be treated exactly the way you want to be treated. YOU decide that you are that and deserve that right now, not just when man treats you accordingly. I swear you can try to look like the most conventionally attractive woman, and try to be the best possible person inside, and still not be \"good enough\" for a lot of men. So many women, however they look, don't get chosen. It could be for many reasons, but I do know that all those men who didn't choose you, you dodged a bullet because they also weren't good enough for you. I also know you put yourself out there so many times in so many ways, which is so impressive like so many people are too scared to do that, but that also means you get exposed more to the risk of being rejected. The more you date, the more you meet people and so the more you would feel \"everyone rejects me\" when actually you're just meeting lots of men who happen to not be your type. Remember to shift your thinking pattern to: \"Are they good enough for me?\", \"Is he treating me with respect?\" etc. You are allowed to think that way no matter what you look like, your age, your history... Also you said you caught feelings for that man after you were talking sexually. Advice for the future: when a man talks to you sexually before you're in a relationship, he won't catch lasting feelings for you. From personal experience and from what I've seen people say online, men tend to choose from the start whether they like you just sexually or romantically. Once you're put in one box, they likely won't change their mind. But most important takeaways: you're not alone in this feeling at all. It's not your fault, and it's not your job to change yourself to earn anyone's love. Work on your self-esteem and standards for dating. What are your standards? When they don't match them, reject those men. Don't just want any man, because lots of them are bad apples anyway. Anyway I hope this helps a little bit because again, I relate and so many others relate to this feeling. Keep working on your self-esteem, your love for yourself, and keep putting yourself out there. I'm certain you'll meet a healthy man who will commit to you all the way.",

Started drinking and taking drugs as a teenager.\n\nIn my mid-twenties, I found a spiritual community that helped me out of that lifestyle and a few years later, I left my home country and moved to a place where this community is more active. Lost contact with all of my old friends.\n\nHave always been struggling to fit into society, dropped out of university and got a job but burnt out in my early 30's. Was diagnosed with autism and adhd around that time. Also ended up homeless, was moving around a lot between 2014 and 2018 with no place to rest while also suffering from major depression and serious fatigue. Got no support from my family, they only carried on with mental abuse so I cut off ties with them.\n\nGot disability pension 2018 at the age of 35. Found a decent place to live but also isolated myself totally since then. Was also in a destructive relationship, ended it in late 2019 since he threatened to beat me up and kill me. Then pandemic happened and I got even more isolated.\n\nLeft the spiritual community last year since I found out they're a cult; got no real support from them whatsoever, they just manipulated me into thinking that all negative things happening to me are my own fault and result of my past actions, and there was nothing I could do about it and that I was on my own. Got contact with some cult survivor groups and made close friends with one person online. Soon we developed romantic feelings to each other and since a couple of months or so we've been in a long distance relationship. He's been my everything since then but just like me, he suffers from ptsd and has since 10 days or so behaved very weirdly. Isolated from the rest of the world, hardly responding to my messages and when he does, it takes nearly one day or so.\n\nI think I'm having a mental breakdown, I'm nearly suicidal. What's the point of going on with life? It's only been a series of tragedies and I seem to make terrible mistakes all the time. Have zero friends I can rely on and I'm too broken to make it on my own. Thought that me and my boyfriend (or maybe I should consider myself single at this point?) would have supported each other and start a new life together but it seems he's not on the same page anymore. I just can't cope with him disappearing, not giving me any kind of validation or showing any signs that he wants to communicate with me and sort things out. So on top of all this, my heart's also broken now.\n\nAfter a life like this, how can I carry on without family or friends or anyone to rely on? I just want to give up",

This guy had everything--except for that one thing but he soldiered on.  And that's what life demands of us sometimes. Small steps. the same step over and over again. We may have to take 1,000 or 100,000, but the willingness and courage to do that even in the face of debilitating pain saves us.\n\nNicholas Morosoff was falsely accused and sentenced to life, in solitary confinement,  at Schlusselberg Fortress in Czarist Russia. He was kept in a cold, dark cell no bigger than a stall for 22 years. He was stricken with scurvy; he hallucinated, but he decided to live despite everything. Several hours a day were committed to exercise. He forbade himself from dwelling on the past and the future. But what was there in the present? Study, poetry, small moments of beauty--the changing colors of Lake Lagoda, among other things. When he was released, the only signs of his imprisonment were his grey hair. He was enthusiastic and vigorous. He also got married. When asked how he survived and thrived, he answered, \"I willed myself to have faith in myself despite everything, to develop courage, to avoid fearful thoughts. I took small, fleeting pleasure in the pigeons perched on my window, a night sky full of stars--and books.  I had to learn how to be happy or perish.\"\n\nTwenty-two years!  How infinitely more tolerable, in comparison, is returning to an apartment where we live alone or attending a movie by ourselves?

As I've gotten older and allowed myself to brew on this feeling, I've recognized that it is loneliness. Once my brain registered that, it made it hurt 10 times more. I'm a 22F and I feel like I've never had a deep relationship with anyone, \"friends\" and family included. I've never had any romantic interactions in my life, which is saddening of course, but what I crave more than anything is to have a deep friendship with someone. I'm hopelessly lonely, and its so difficult to see other people form connections so quickly and so openly, while I feel paralyzed in social situations. Anxiety is something I deal with and fight to manage but it is becoming too much now. I'm dealing with all my struggles alone and frankly, my thoughts of suicide only keep getting worse day by day.

Colleges are often well-engineered towards helping young people grow as people.  I had a few counselors during college and it was very inexpensive and very helpful.  My college student health center also had activities like assertiveness training and different types of support groups for everything from addiction recovery to lgbtq+ support.\n\nI was very shy and repressed as a young person -- in my case because of stuff like alcoholism, abuse and neglect in my family.  The counseling and support I got during university was the beginning of my growth as a person because I hardly grew at all while I was with my family, I had no emotional connections or support.  It was extremely painful feeling so far behind and left out.  While I was still in college, I began exploring groups and activities in my community that helped me continue my journey (for example, a mens group that I've been part of for decades).\n\nI started around the same age you are now and my life got progressively better and I had high points many times along the way that I never thought I'd get to experience.  I have two close friends now that I can talk about anything with and I talk with each of them once a week and there are others I could call if I needed to.  You seem more able to reach out for help than I was at that age, I think you can do it.",

House looks like shit. But I‚Äôm not a tough guy, hood rat anything like that because I grew up in a preppy white neighborhood. Everyone has nice houses while mine looks like a trap house in the middle of the nice neighborhood. I never had nice toys growing up. Never had ps4 or Xbox. It doesn‚Äôt matter, I‚Äôm not superficial. As a kid I was draw and make cut outs and use newspaper to make my own toys. I‚Äôm decently intelligent, but I act like a tard. Why? I have anxiety an ocd diagnosed, but I also VERY VERY likely have adhd. Very likely as in I was in denial for the longest time, and my parents didn‚Äôt want to get me tested and I was supposed to get tested but I never did. People with adhd literally tell me I have adhd. I have almost every key mark symptom. Don‚Äôt even want to get tested atp bc for some reason every other loser who has it gate keeps it. It‚Äôs severe if i do have it. Well that sucks, my parents don‚Äôt believe in it, I‚Äôm already past Highschool so there‚Äôs little benefit in getting aid now, and I did decent in Highschool but struggling my ass off now and there‚Äôs little I can do about it. It keeps me up at night at times. Mind wont shut up. If it‚Äôs not that it‚Äôs my ocd or anxiety giving me a tuff time. If it‚Äôs not that THEN ITS MY DUST MITE ALLEGY AND ASTHMA, WHCIH LITERALLY MAKES IT HARD TO BREATHE, SLEEP, AND FOCUS ON TOP OF ALL THAT. Well at least I can eat what I want right? Wrong. I have gut issues. Like really bad. I suspect I have IBS but again never got diagnosed because my luck with things in general is just not great and one of those things is getting help I need. Maybe the world just doesn‚Äôt care for me. No matter how many other people I help it doesn‚Äôt seem to come back to me. People automatically are aggressive towards me. No matter how big or small. So I struggle to think, focus, eat, rest, properly perhaps I‚Äôm gifted in some other aspect? Athletics? I love sports. Too bad I suck at almost everything athletic. I‚Äôve never been fast. Never. Have horrible stamina. Assume both of that is from asthma. My speed and stamina have improved REALLY dramatically since a child and I‚Äôm grateful. I guess at this point I‚Äôm slightly above average if anything but that‚Äôs because I‚Äôm a young male and the world is majority metabolically unhealthy. My genetics aren‚Äôt great for lifting or athletics. I have a very lanky frame, and I am skinny fat. I have great agility and jumping power though, I‚Äôm greatful for that but if I was healthy I would be even better. You‚Äôd think I was athletic looking at me but I hate being such a disappointment. My catching abilities are also subpar. And don‚Äôt get me started on throwing. One thing I was blessed with is looks. Sort of. I have decent facial features, and my face holds very little fat and is quite robust. But all this does is make me attention hungry and self obsessed because it‚Äôs one of the few good things in my life. Or was. I have auto immune condition that not only fqs up my skin but now is affecting my hair. My hair use to give me tips at the drive though. I was bullied as a kid for being ulgy so when I was getting praised all of a sudden it felt insanely good. Now it‚Äôs Thinner all over. Think it‚Äôs affecting my facial hair too. My skin use to be great now it‚Äôs uneven, blemished, has acne scars, ACTUAL scars, and I have had multitide of issues in the past like whiteheads, keratosis pilaris, eczema you name it. Right now I have clogged inner sweat glands on my thighs. Gross. My penis I think is probably below average. The acid reflex and probably increased acidity from difficulty breathing while I sleep makes my teeth naturally yellow. I had fqed teeth as a child and I got braces but they took so long an never finished the job so now I have a gap between one of my teeth and my canine so I look like a pirate. And although I said I have good looks, I‚Äôm slightly above average at best. I‚Äôm by no means some Sean o pry or anything like that. I‚Äôm also a dark skinned, curly haired Indian. And I have all these health issues so young, plus fqed teeth so now it doesn‚Äôt matter if a girl checks me, it‚Äôs almost basically clips. And because I‚Äôm south Asian, but dark skinned male with curly hair I‚Äôm hated on by literally every race. White, black my own, you name it. Can‚Äôt name a single group of people or country whre I feel like I‚Äôd belong and get appreciated by the people. Def not my ethnic country Bangladesh and prob not the USA. I was a class clown growing up so epople sort of like me for that but nobody takes my feeling seriously at the same time. And like I said, my ethnic origin and phenotype may not be ideal but I got to look good for like a few years and now (whole still in my youth) I barely get to experience that now. I have nothing redeemable at this point. My family hates me. They have yelled at me constantly my whole life. I‚Äôm horrible ways. And I‚Äôm a freaking baby. I wish so much I was a brave, tough non anxious man. So much so. My mom and dad hate each other but never divorced because of culture. Verbal and physical violence towards me, and each other was so common growing up. I in general don‚Äôt succeed in things I‚Äôm passionate about. I was religious from 13-17 to cope with all my stress in life. Islamic. Now I‚Äôm starting to let go of thst too. I was never raised religious , I took it upon my self. My dad literally doesn‚Äôt even like it. He constantly ridicules me and hates me for being religious. How unlucky am i, I‚Äôm the only one with an ethnic dad who dislikes that his son is religious? The religion he basically chose FOR ME. All he does is talk about grades and talk down on me and my mom. Back to my looks I‚Äôm much taller than him. One of the few good things in my life is my height but I honestly don‚Äôt care mcuh for it. My sister hates me too. She has anger issues and my parents can barely handle her. Yet they bought her a car. And not me even though I was and still am in college and full time employed. I have this ridiculously annoying cousin who can‚Äôt mind her own busienss for her life who immigrated here and lives with us. 30 year old child. Well she as gone.. WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE, and now that I dropped out and am attending university near my house she back..my life bro. My job pays below minimum wage and biweekly yet I love it. It‚Äôs one of the few escape I have. I don‚Äôt play video games much bc of lack of access, proper education and because I‚Äôm not great at those either. All these people talking about money doesn‚Äôt buy happiness, or how they are falling apart because of a heartbreak and yet I can barely struggle to enjoy even the little pleasures in life and for what reason? What wrong have I done? I‚Äôm not even superficial never have been all I wanted was a chance and I never got it? I don‚Äôt even have the balls to take my own pathetic life. I hate natural selection for ignoring all my ancestors and somehow making a mess like me. I use to be scared of dying in my sleep, but if I could be guaranteed heaven in the afterlife I‚Äôd take it in a heartbeat. So tired of living my life. I‚Äôm sorry for this rant but I have to let all this out. There are a dozen or more other things I could have listed. But as I‚Äôm typing this it‚Äôs 7am and I got like four hours sleep last night and want to get some more today. I‚Äôm sorry if reading this wasted your time.",

For years, I had this belief that one day I would find love but after that delusion started fading away a couple of years ago, I've never been the same and slowly descending. That delusion kept my hopes up my whole life when I got my heart broken each time. I can get dates and even had relationships but I always went with women I truly didn't love in hopes that maybe that feeling would change. In the end, it didn't and both of us ended up feeling worse. It was a learning experience for me. Unfortunately I've never had a girl that I like, like me. I looked into a lot of self improvement and just being myself but no matter what I did, it truly felt like I was cursed. \n\nI exercise 3-4 days a week, go on frequent walks, tried making friends at work and social events, tried social and dating apps but nothings helped my mental health. I've even moved twice in the last 3 years in hopes that a new town would re-energize my life. When I finish work, I find myself sometimes just staring at my tv screen and walking around my house as I'm starting to lose my desire to enjoy the hobbies I used to enjoy. Most of my friends I still keep in touch with but they are often busy with their families. The only reason why I've not pulled the plug yet is because I don't want my parents to suffer but I truly don't know how long I'm gonna last.",

                "text_body": "Hallo hallo!\n\nSo I kind of just want to vent out my feelings and maybe I can be lonely with all of you.\n\nBasically, I feel lonely despite seeming like I have a lot of friends. It's a weird feeling for me because I heard this is something extroverts experience. Maybe I became an extrovert in college, I don't know, but I essentially know a lot of people to the point that people I seemingly don't know say hi to me in the hallways.\n\nIt might seem like I'm so lucky to have so many friends and acquaintances, but it feels like I'm all alone in a crowded room. They know of me, but they don't know me, and when I want to deepen the relationship, I end up pushing people away. I had people telling me I'm too much. Someone told me they can handle me online, but they can't stand me in real life. It probably has something to do with me being bipolar. I'm like a puppy on rollerskates and the only people I feel understood by are people with ADHD (not even people with bipolar disorder), but even then, I don't have a lot of interests in common with the people I know with ADHD.\n\nI also have a best friend, but she's hanging out more with her other friends. I feel like she prefers to be with them. I kind of feel like I'm lagging behind. We're also drifting apart in terms of our interests, so that probably contributes to why she'd rather hang out with other people.\n\nI kind of just want to be friends with people with the same interests as me \\*and\\* who will put in as much effort as I give. My relationships tend to be one-sided. I keep getting hurt because I keep investing in people who won't give me anything back. And it's not like I go to these relationships expecting to be showered with everything under the sun. Even just a small \"hello\", unprompted; an invite to call on Discord and talk about the most mundane things; an invite to play games or watch shows; maybe talk about our thoughts and feelings sometimes, then laugh at a meme the next second. I want someone who is kind to me because they like spending time with me and aren't there to get something out of me or exploit my desire for a connection. I just want a friend, but I feel like all I am is an afterthought.\n\nBut I will say, for anyone who feels like anything I said resonates with them, I'm still optimistic. Maybe not today or tomorrow, but we will find our people. Just be careful not to fall down a rabbit hole of misery and bitterness. It‚Äôs easy to fall into spaces that reinforce negativity, where bitterness and resentment fester rather than heal. As much as I like the internet, for example, I know it is filled with echo chambers that can make us feel temporarily validated but ultimately trap us in cycles of self-doubt and cynicism.\n\nRemember, you are not unlovable. You are not ugly. You are not unworthy. We all need love, and we can find the connection we desperately crave. We just need to look at the right places. The world is vast, and there are people out there who will see us for who we are‚Äîflaws and all‚Äîand embrace us wholeheartedly. It may take time, and it may require stepping outside our comfort zones, but meaningful relationships are possible. I've seen it happen, I felt it once before, and you can too. No matter how lonely or lost we feel, we are not beyond love. We are not invisible. Everyone needs and deserves connection. Take care of yourself until the time comes. Exercise, eat healthy, sleep well, go to a therapist, and indulge in your hobbies. We got this.  \n  \nHere's to making friends we haven't met yet.",

I could have a few people around me but I prefer loneliness over friends who makes me anxious,  i always choose self respect and peace over toxic relationships so thats why I'm lonely, I've experienced good friendships and bad ones, but all of them has ended somehow wich Is fine! \nIt's difficult to maintain self love when you're not supported,  still I'm really grateful for supports that I've got in life, but people aren't our objects we cant force them or beg them for attention. so they come and go , or they may take time away on their own, being busy with life, self discovery, enjoying other people's company. For a while or forever. \nAs an 18 year old girl I feel like I need to glow, share and receive, explore and talk to people without being stressed. Having friends who care about me and i care about them. But I've been struggling to find a friend or a group of friends who can make me feel more supported and less isolated. Specially in this difficult days of getting ready for important life changing exams and studying for 12 hours a day!\nPlus I'm having a long distance relationship,  I'm grateful for him but at this point it's just me alone having to build a life before taking another step! Sometimes future is hazy and unclear and your only option is to MOVE FORWARD! ‚ô°",

At least give it a try!\nAnd I also accepted that life isn't the ideal romantic we see online,  I used to be someone who romanticise everything but that exotic moments are only 5 percent of the life, life means difficulty, humans are made for it. So we should start to experiment ourselves mabe you wonder yourself after seeing your potential. \nOh And another great motivation is that one night, after depression is over ,you sleep so well without a heavy heart. And in the morning everything is clearer And better,  you will be so proud of everything you did to get out of this depressed zone!\n\nSorry it became long ^^\nI have best wishes for you. \nMake the most out if dark , cold, lonely days mabe you miss it one day!",

I am not sure if what I am feeling is loneliness or something else entirely, so I would like for anyone that is willing to read the entire length of my emotional odyssey know that I appreciate your effort, and thanks for reading. Disclaimer, my English is not that good, it's not my first language, so I apologise again.\n\nI suppose, I'll start from the beginning, but before that, a bit about myself. I am 19, barely an adult, I know that at that age, emotions aren't supposed to be \"real\" or so they say. I was born into a \"toxic\" family, by my definition they are toxic, but I know others who would say that they aren't toxic at all.\n\nWhen I was a kid, I had little to no friends. I can't remember much, but what I do know is that I never left my house to play with friends like a \"normal\" child (I don't really know what constitutes as normalcy) my parents never let me play with neighbour kids because to them \"we are not at their level\". So I spent most of my days watching cartoons at home. Time pass by and as I grew from kindergarten to elemantary, I never really had friends that I could talk to after class. My parents were always at work, and my brother lives with my grandparents. So I spent more time watching cartoons. My family always made fun of me when I watch cartoons, because to them I don't have a life. However, when I tried new things like drawing and writing, all that they did was treated what I made like a disappointment, never once did I get a nice feedback, it was always, \"it's okay\" and then I will find the paper in the trash. Maybe that was normal and I'm just weak.\n\nSkip by a few more years, I am in highschool, I for once found friends that I can talk with after school (through discord mostly), but as the years go by, we went astray, switching schools didn't help too. The next 1 and a half year of school was great, I had a few friends none were ever friend friend (if you get what I mean), but I had friends. That all changed when I left school though. After graduation I worked a bit, never really had a human connection that left me feeling for more. It was always the connection where I won't be able to talk to them outside of work hours. Even with my effort to be friendly with everyone, no one seem to let me be a friend. 2 years later, here I am, almost ending my first year of college. I have friends, but they have better friends, people that they rather spend time with. At every run for the corner, I will always be the backup friend, always the guy they call when they need me, and never when they don't. \n\nMaybe I'm just unlikeable. So, I didn't mind much about it. But today, after accidentally stumbling upon a clip from the Loud House (one of my favourite shows growing up, it is still running by the way), something clicked in me. I am lonely. I feel lonely. I feel like I am sitting in a crowd but I'm alone. Maybe I deserve this feeling. Being a lonely man in a lively world. I loved that show not because it was funny or because the characters were nice or anything, it was just because the characters had each other. When I see them hugging each other, I felt like I want that, being wanted by my family, or anyone really. When I see the main character and his best friend, I envy that, I want to have a best friend that I can count on too, and he can count on me. I really wanted that.\n\nBut I suppose we can't have everything we want in life. So, I suppose that is my story. Thanks for reading, and I hope you have a wonderful day or night wherever you may be. And I am sorry if my call for deliverance is a tad bit too long, and a tad bit too shallow, I don't know where to go.",

It's missing people. It makes you feel almost like a child that was not taken care, \n\nIf you feel happy when people visit you, it means you are nor in distress with being around people. Lonely people can feel interactions to be unpleasant but it's not likely. If you feel lonely, you want to be around people, even if it's difficult for you. You can say that autistics do not enjoy being around people as much as non-autistics. So maybe people who feel awckward in interactions still want to be around friends.\n\nSo, no, loneliness does not mean feeling unhappy in a crowd necessarily.

You might not even feel real connection with the person if you guys have different interests. You honestly aren‚Äôt missing out on much but if you really want to get into one you have to start talking to people and by people I mean women lol. Regardless of your intentions I recommend just talking to women without and intentions or expectations. Become friends with that person and it may become more. You can even ask somebody for their number randomly and if you get rejected that‚Äôs okay. Might even want to try dating apps which you may well have some success in. The feeling gets better after being in a relationship but you still get that acute feeling of loneliness, especially once you get out of it. I know you probably feel like you‚Äôre falling behind in life rn but you‚Äôre not. You have time, so if you really want to get into a relationship you have to be brave enough to actually ask somebody out and if you can do that, build your way up to it or even use dating apps if you‚Äôd like. Anyways that‚Äôs my 2 cents",

Do you have an emotion associated with your connection? Is it a good emotion? Is it at least partially a good emotion? When life sucks for you, do you get some kind of comfort from your connections?\n\nI don't know if these are weird questions or not. I think I've just recently realized that a big part of the reason people choose to go on living even when their lives are shit, is because they have a connection to someone, or maybe a bunch of connections to a bunch of someones, that make life feel like it's worth living.\n\nWhat's your experience like? Do you never feel done with life because you always can look forward to experiencing connections with someone? Or do you feel done with life and stay here only because you don't want to cause your people to suffer? Is there something in your connection(s) that makes you feel like your life is worth living, that gives you something to look forward to?\n\nI feel like the proverbial person who has lived their life in a monochrome gray room -- there's no way for them to know what it's like to see a color, even if they studied color theory to the Nth degree. Of course, I could be wrong, I don't know for sure that a connection feels like something, but it sure would explain a lot and clear up a lot of my confusion about how other people get through life and actually want to keep going. It would explain why all these therapists over the decades keep telling me that I'll feel better if I make more friends -- there's supposed to be something in friendship that feels good and is comforting and kindof makes up, at least a little, for how shit life is? Why else would therapists keep recommending it?\n\nBut I don't know, I'm just now coming to these new thoughts, and it's kindof devastating to think about. What's your experience of connection? Do you feel it? Does it feel good?",

I've done everything in my power, for years upon years, to try and \"put myself out there\", but it's always felt like I'm in square one no matter how far or how hard I try to dig myself out of this proverbial hole.\n\nAll said and done, I want to join an incel community. I feel like it's the only place where I wouldn't stick out like a sore thumb, where I can find solace in the company of those doomed to fail at life as I eventually will (or have already). At this point I've accepted that I'll never have romantic or sexual relationships again; I'm just so ugly and everything I do is a turn off to most \"normal\" people, for lack of a better word.\n\nI've recently come to a realization that I'm probably autistic/neurodivergent, though I'm comfortable enough to call myself r*tarded since nothing could be closer to the truth. It's been a very hard pill to stomach as I'm probably the LAST person who should be cursed with any kind of social disability.  I crave human intimacy, I'd give an arm and a leg to form effortless connections with others, especially with the opposite gender; but I'm endowed with something that makes it infinitely harder to obtain, at which point giving up is the most reasonable course of action.\n\nI want everyone's unbiased opinions on the incel communities because I'm wary and wilfully avoidant of the consequential negativity that pervades them. In short, I need to know if any of them are non-toxic, non misogynistic etc., spaces where I can just exist among other unfortunate souls? I'll never have the place of belonging I truly need, but if this is the next best thing, so be it.\n\nI know practically nothing when it comes to being social. I've existed around others for years yet I've learned precious little about social cues, appropriate decorum, or all that jazz surrounding interpersonal protocol. I'm starved of physical affection, devoid of emotional connections and severely detached from any positivity otherwise afforded the rest of society.\n\nJust tell me where I should go, and if the incel communities are the haven I believe it to be. I'll never be loved to the extent I've aways desired, so I might as well hate myself surrounded by those that would do the same.\n\nDISCLAIMER: I'll try to ignore replies that I disagree with because it almost always cascades into an argument when I respond in states of visceral emotional intensity (such as now, to state the obvious).\n\nP.S. try not to ridicule the depths to which I strain in adequately expressing my thoughts and feelings through writing... I have the self awareness to realize that even the stilted manner in which I write serves as a testament to how r*tarded I am. Though there's nothing I know that would solve such debilitating hard-wiring.\n\nTLDR I get no girls and there's hardly any changing that. Every day i feel pain that does not subside. Should I find solace among incels, for i am clearly one of them?",

You are 21, that is very very young. Please don't write yourself off to some sort of pre destined future. Life doesn't work that way.\n\nI understand you're in significant pain over this. I would suggest therapy, dealing with your emotions in a way that is healthy for you and doesn't end up isolating and displaying hostility towards the opposite gender. That is not the way forward. \n\nThere are also plenty of demisexual people out there. It's truly not all about looks. \n\nBut please don't resort to something like this.

So if you're not having luck dating focus on yourself and try to simply be a person worth loving, embrace selfless do things for all people simply because it's a good thing to do or help someone, put time into school or work find comfort in its continuity. Take the time to learn a skill like woodworking, machine repair, cooking get lost in the excitement of mastering something u can control. Join a gym to give yourself an opportunity to master your body as well allow yourself to accept yourself by becoming yourself, each mans body is a statue of David waiting to be chiseled into. Embrace philosophy of the stoics like Marcus Aurelius to find peace and encouragement throughout gratitude for the simple things or try reading transcendentalism authors like Emerson or Thoreau to learn to find peace and solace in times of isolation  and the the beauty of nature as way to repair the soul.",

Its lately been creeping back in after being gone for about 2 years. Heres some thoughts on it.

Alot of people might help if they knew how but because of the nature of loneliness, lonely people can push others away that are trying to help. Which furthers the problem of them getting the connection/care they need.\n\n\n\n   I think the thing people dont understand is how all consuming loneliness can be and how hard to function and even try. It can make anything and everything feel utterly pointless and hopeless. It can absorb all the light in your heart to the point you are completely filled and surrounded by darkness. It feels like trying to push a huge boulder around or having a golf cart or a small bear on your back sometimes. Imagine trying to lift that and go do your life and then pretend the entire time its not there. The crazy thing is in a manner of speaking thats kinda what you have to do to get out of the loneliness.  I just dont think people understand how very VERY hard it is to get out of the pattern and the existential state of loneliness once youre there. \n\nI think the world needs to let go of the belief that lonely people are not trying, that theyre somehow lazy or not applying themselves. Maybe some are like that i dont know. But i know a good many are not and theyre thrust into the sittuation where theyre struggling with loneliness. If people would just reach out to their friends and check on them or even just say hello and let them know theyre being thought of it would help so much. The problem as i stated above is most people are so self absorbed and dont check on their friends. They dont even realize they are part of the issue with the person being lonely. Is it their fault though? Not really its just human nature i guess. \n\nWhen youre lonely it feels like theres a wall around you that keeps anything and everything out and the same for whats inside with you. You are unable to share and connect the same as others cant reach you. So the very thing you need is the very thing you are kept from by your state of being when youre lonely. Your very state of existence at that time. \n\nCONNECTION is the key to it all.  I think loneliness is misunderstood in that people think it means in order to help they surround a person with people or sticking them at some social event etc. Getting them a date. NONE of that stuff really helps if there's no connection. All of it can help if there is. But it comes down to being able to form bonds and feeling like somebody actually cares about you. Feeling heard and seen and understood and that you matter. Thats what cures loneliness. WE all just want somebody to tell us we matter and they care about us. That they want to be in our lives and they value us. Loneliness is a loss of self in a lot of ways. Its a loss of the ability to care and to love as we should because we feel so overwhelmed and blind and thrown away and not good enough and the list goes on. Imagine living in a house and having to rebuild it once a week because your roommate loneliness burns the house down. thats what it truly feels like living with loneliness.  \n\nTheres also the problem of not everybodys loneliness is the same. Which makes it even more complicated to help people. Youll see all kinds of different numbers and schools of thought on this but i do believe for sure theres different types.",

                        "comment": "I have a friend i messaged a week before about playing some coop games with he says sure. I message him the day of and say i seen you were on with some friends in game i didnt want to intterupt but just let me know when you feel up to some coop, no reply.\n\nHes on discord atm with a couple people. I could hop in there and we could play something and then it would be like nothings wrong but im just tired of doing that and tired of people that cant even take the time to respond to somebody.  I have a couple other friends online i messaged one of them gave them a game i got in a game bundle because it was on their wish list. No response. Thats been a week ago. I have another friend i messaged her she finally replied but then was barely speaking to me like a reply every 20 minutes or something. Its just tiring reaching out for connection and it not being there. And people in the real world dont tell you if theres an issue unless you have an argument or something else. The vast majority of people id say a good 90% of people are horrible communicators and the only time they actually communicate is when theyre forced to. Then dont understand when their lives fall to shit.\n\nSo people misunderstanding loneliness is only half the problem. They dont even understand themselves or what they need etc. How can they help somebody whos lonely?  It feels like everybodys just bumping around in the dark and people fill their lives up with material things when we are not material beings, we are spiritual beings. We need things of the spirit, not things of this world. We need connection, and built trust, we need compassion and care and love, and we need to give those things. Thats how you heal from all this but do you kind of see how complicated a matter it CAN be? It doesnt have to be but in a real world scenario thats usually kinda how it ends up like how i described above. \n\nThen you have other unavoidable things that happen that of course would make anybody lonely. My mama passed in september after a massive stroke. Then 2 days ago i had to put my cat Milo to sleep because he had two horrible wounds on his legs wed been wrapping with bandages and the wounds were getting worse. If wed amputated he couldnt walk, if we kept wrapping them he risked getting a horrible infection and dieing suffering so we made the hard choice. He was perfectly healthy otherwise so it was really unfair to have to make that choice. Lack of a choice sometimes i think is the loneliest thing of all. \n\nFor me too personally like right now, i deal with it so much i just get to feeling exhausted to where its hard to keep trying if nobody else does you know? It usually passes but sometimes it stays around for months for me personally.  I dont want to dwell on sadness or live in a dark place. I want to laugh and love and enjoy life and find beauty and hope in things. But loneliness is nothing if not persistant. There was a time when loneliness was like a living thing for me, not what id call a friend, but definitely a companion.\n\nI know this is a long reply but these are my thoughts on it. I wish everybody thats reading this a good day today and even if i dont know you, please know that i do care and you matter and your thoughts matter and  your hopes and dreams also matter.\n\nPlease be kind to yourself. Because sometimes nobody else will. Trust me i know how that goes.",

In Virginia we have these programs called ‚Äúgovernors school‚Äù where you spend a portion of your school day taking STEM based college classes to build credits and shorten your eventual bachelor‚Äôs degree in a STEM field. Throughout the process I felt so miserable and completely isolated myself. Additionally I became so disinterested in my work that I would end up procrastinating till 3 or 4 in the morning to begin assignments. This meant many back to back sleepless nights and horrible issues with my mental well-being leading me to even become convinced I was schizophrenic. My advice to you is to remember that success is only as meaningful as the fulfillment you receive from it. You shouldn‚Äôt derive your validation from others approval, but you also shouldn‚Äôt lack validation entirely in your life. If you are not receiving any fulfillment from your life do not be scared to change and adapt so that you may prioritize your own happiness. At your age I became convinced that any social connection I formed would be meaningless by the end of school and that I could only rely on myself. I still believe self sufficiency and fulfillment is virtuous but I recognize how damaging this mindset has been to me. I have zero social drive or ability and it has heavily impeded my own happiness and personality. Even now in college I cannot shake my tendency towards complete solitude and depression. Please do not make the same mistakes I did and if you have any questions about the path feel free to ask.",

I‚Äôve gone through the dating apps , friends of friends, everything, but I just can‚Äôt seem to click with anyone. \n\nOver the last 2 years, I have made some serious changes to my health. There is a post on my profile about it, but basically I went from drinking 40ish beers a week to occasionally 2 a week, if that. I have lost 60 lbs, I go to the gym to keep myself in the best shape I‚Äôve ever been in, and I work construction. \n\nI did all of these changes for me, for my health, but I‚Äôd be lying if I said I didn‚Äôt want a relationship out of it. I constantly seem to end up in the friend zone. I‚Äôm not particularly good at talking to girls, though I think I‚Äôm better now than I used to be. \n\nThis all came to a head over the last couple weeks. I met a girl at my climbing gym and hit it off with her. We started climbing together a bunch, hung out for a bite to eat a few times, and I thought the vibes were great. She even told me that she was really looking forward to spending time with me. \n\nLast weekend, we went out for a chill night out together and again I thought we were hitting things off really well. I dropped her off at her place, said goodnight and made tentative plans to hang out during this past week. When I got home though, I got that dreaded text that I‚Äôve gotten 1000 times before: ‚ÄúI just got out of a really toxic relationship, and as much as I like spending time with you, I‚Äôm not ready for that again yet‚Äù. \n\nI immediately felt all of that old self doubt slamming into me like a ton of bricks. I sent her a message saying I understood, and I hoped we could still spend time together as friends, seeing if maybe this could turn into something. She heart reacted that, and responded absolutely. I figured at least that‚Äôs a start. However, she has not responded to hardly any messages this week. The plan had been for me to help her move some furniture and other things this week, but each time I asked for a time to help her out, she came up with some reason why she couldn‚Äôt(they could be true, probably are, just feels like she‚Äôs avoiding me). \n\nAll of this is just sparking all of my old self-doubt and depression. It sucks. ",

The thing is I don‚Äôt think anyone in my family could even guess that this is how I spend all of my school days. I feel like I can‚Äôt be myself anywhere, that I don‚Äôt belong anywhere either. I always act happy when I‚Äôm around my family because I can‚Äôt bring myself to be vulnerable around them. But nobody gives a fuck about me or cares about how I‚Äôm doing. I lost a few friends since last year and grew apart some of them too. But it‚Äôs not the only reason of why I feel lonely. I feel lonely in my head, I feel lonely when I‚Äôm surrounded by people, I feel lonely when I‚Äôm having a good time. I can‚Äôt talk about how I feel to anyone I know because I know that they wouldn‚Äôt care or listen, or would just minimize my feelings or make fun of me. I don‚Äôt feel like I have anyone in my entourage who I feel comfortable with and close to . I do have friends who I talk to from time to time, but I don‚Äôt feel a real bond or connection to any of them. I lost a few friends like I said earlier, but even them didn‚Äôt care about me either, or were straight up toxic people. So I‚Äôve been feeling very sad, and the fact that I don‚Äôt have anybody to talk about it or cheer me up makes me even sadder. I didn‚Äôt have school this week, classes where canceled. I spent all my days staying at home, with almost no notifications on my phone, no one to talk to even irl, with no motivation to do anything but lay down. During times like these, I start to hate my body and myself, and I disgust myself. I eat more because of sadness and stress, then cry because I feel so fat, but still can‚Äôt stop myself from eating so much. People don‚Äôt believe me when I say I hate myself and say they‚Äôd do anything to look like me, but they wouldn‚Äôt be able to comprehend the pure hatred I have for this body. I also feel guilty for not doing anything all day, but still procrastinate and feel stressed while doing so. Every night, I can‚Äôt sleep at all and start to think about every thing that‚Äôs wrong in my life, then i fall asleep and have nightmares almost every time. I can‚Äôt stop comparing myself to everyone I know, and think about how dumb, ugly, fat and useless I feel. I feel so lost and behind in life compared to people my age or people I know. But I don‚Äôt have the motivation to do anything about it or even think positively, so I just pity myself. I think what makes me feel the worst is I can‚Äôt bring myself to accept the way I‚Äôm feeling. I stay on my phone all day to avoid my brain from having these negative thoughts, then nighttime comes and everything comes out at once. I can‚Äôt talk about it to my brother and my parents cause I‚Äôm just not used to it and it brings me a huge feeling of discomfort, but keeping everything to myself is so painful too. These feelings are so heavy that I couldn‚Äôt even bring myself to talk about them to my therapist, it just wouldn‚Äôt come out and I don‚Äôt know why, so I just lied during my session. I don‚Äôt know how to get out of this negative place I‚Äôm in mentally",

The state of the world is not normal and they want to sell you everything they can to make you forget that.\n\n\nI would just say that it will get better as you age and you'll probably find your people in college. But you also have to keep a positive mindset no matter how hard that is.¬†\n\n\nIf I had one piece of actionable advice it would be to start something that you can work on consistently that you've always wanted to do. This could be going to the gym, getting good at art, learning to code AND building something with it. Pick something you can do regularly and that has clear, overt milestones. Start with the easiest version of whatever that is and then just take baby steps of doing more and more now and then.",

It could also work into different subreddits, but this one seems the most fitting. Ive only shared this briefly with my parents and a bit more in depth with my therapist, so its a bit weird to figure out how to put it into words.\n\nSo im just going to say it: I feel like im missing someone thats supposed to be here, but isnt. Its not a certain person that has a name or face, its not someone I\\`ve met. The best way to explain it is, and i\\`m sorry if this sounds a bit nerdy or something, like someone was actually here, but they got erased somehow and everyone\\`s memories of them were erased as well.  However, I can still feel them, but not strongly enough to see their face or actually remember who they were. (What i feel is important to point out is that i **know** that didnt happen, nobody got magically wiped out, its just a sensation that I\\`m trying to understand\\*\\*)\\*\\*.\n\nAs if(and this is the part that sounds nerdy), they live in a parallel universe. I like to think of parallel universes not as actual parallel strings, but as a big lump of strings, all mixed in together, still separate though. And sometimes there are places in which the strings are closer to one another and you can hear/feel something from the other universe. Similar to that, it almost feels like the veil between two realities is thinner in some places and what i feel is an echo of what is happening in the parallel universe. (bear with me) Again,  I don't actually belive that's what's happening, it's just a comparison, because I'm trying to put into words.\n\nThrought the ages of 9/10 - 14, I've sometimes had pretty real dreams in which I was with someone and I could feel this comforting, warm, calms-your-nervous-system kind of peace. Those people felt real and there was a sense of safety when I was with them. I would wake up and miss them.\n\nThen, when I was 14, a pretty weird thing happened. It's the first time I've felt this sensation and it's also the strongest way I've experienced it. I was at school, we had to go outside. Slowly but surely, I started feeling like someone is missing. I was sitting with all of my friends, but still I felt this strong feeling (im so sorry for how much im gonna say this word) like there was an actual person, name, face, personality, that wasn't here. I looked at all my classmates, it was so real I felt the need to count everyone. Sure enough, everyone was there. It was pretty weird, like you miss someone, but you don't know who.\n\nLater that day, or the following day, at dinner, with my parents and brother, I had the same feeling: someone is also supposed to literally sit down with us at the table and they aren't here, like they were taken from us. It's a bittersweet, mostly sad but also a bit agitating eerie sense of longing.\n\nLike a month ago (I'm now 17), I was on Pinterest and i saw this pretty, aesthetic clip of two girls running on a field. For the first time in a long time, i started feeling the whole missing thing again(more soothing though) and i remember thinking: \"I miss her\", except idk who it is and the memories that never happened are very foggy.\n\nA few weeks ago, I was going to school. On the radio, there was a song that had a piano segment very similar to Je te laisserai des mots. Like 10 minutes after, the golden morning rays of sunshine shined in such a pretty way and the birds were chirping. It looked like a cinematic shot of a comforting movie or like a scene from a Life is Strange montage (iykyk).  When I was inside of the school, someone was playing this beautiful song on a piano (our school has a piano that we can play when/if we want during break time). Then for a couple moments, as i was listening to the second piano song that morning, there was that feeling again, this time less of an \"where is this person, i need to find them in here\", and more of a warm, nostalgic sensation. I could almost see a face, I remembered this girl that was in my dreams years ago and she was my adoptive sister. It felt like **she is supposed to be here(** going to school, talking to me, laughing and just doing basic everyday things together) and i just missed her so much. Like everything was slightly off and **emptier**, without her. As if we are locked in separate rooms and I can hear her through the wall, except I don't know where the door is and I don't know to get to her. All in all, the feeling was a bit sad, but mostly comforting(!).\n\nI've been a bit lonely these past few months, or even years(very grateful for my parents, especially my dad, because they're here for me and i don't know how much lonelier i would've been without them). So I thought it's just my minds way of coping, that's why I'm posting it in the loneliness subreddit.\n\nI'm open to more interpretations spiritual of this.\n\nMy therapist suggested I talk to my mom  and see if I have/had a twin or something.\n\nThank you so much for reading all of this and hopefully not thinking I'm crazy :)\n\nIs it just a way of coping with loneliness? Have you guys ever felt like this? How would you interpret it and what could it be? Any advice on what to do/where else should i post this?",

According to a recent Gallup study,¬†**23% of people worldwide**¬†say they feel lonely often. What‚Äôs more concerning? Loneliness doesn‚Äôt just exist‚Äîit¬†**amplifies**¬†other negative emotions:\n\n* People who feel lonely are¬†**36% more likely to feel sad**\n* **31% more likely to feel worried**\n* **30% more likely to feel stressed**\n* Even anger and physical pain increase when loneliness is present\n\nThis raises an important question for our industry:¬†**Is the way we build and engage communities online helping or hurting this problem?**\n\n# The Role of Social Media in Loneliness\n\nSocial platforms were meant to connect us, but for many, they have done the opposite. The rise of engagement-driven algorithms has led to an emphasis on performance - likes, shares, status - rather than¬†**authentic connection**. Users, especially younger demographics, often feel pressured to curate their lives rather than build meaningful relationships.\n\nFinancial hardship is another major factor, those struggling to make ends meet are¬†**twice as likely**¬†to feel lonely. This suggests that access to social engagement and mental well-being tools may be disproportionately available to those with economic stability.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?",

(depending on which one you attended) You seem to be looking for validation in posting this, but I'm sure I'm not the first to say that looking bad is not going to prevent you from having friends.\n\nAdult life is hard. Making friends, as an adult, is hard. Especially after you finish school. This is because (particularly in the US due to many urban planning decisions made over decades and decades all throughout the country) you really have to *seek out* friendship, and community. There's no obvious place to do this, since most Americans don't have their \"third place.\"\n\nWhat you need to do, is probably find that third place. Find a community. The easiest way to do this, is to find a hobby. I personally got into raving before I graduated high school. Now, almost two years later, I'm very deep in the community, and have made basically all my friends that way. And now, I'm so deep in the rave community, I go and do non-rave things with non-ravers, because I met them through rave-adjacent get-togethers. Find you hobby. Find your third place.\n\nAlso, as someone else said in this thread, you *do* have a resting angry expression. This might make it difficult for people to initially want to strike up a conversation with you.\n\nNow on the other hand, if you do have hobbies, a community, and you still feel as though you have no friends, you may have to look inwardly and find out why that is. Maybe it's your attitude. maybe it's your mannerisms, or maybe it could be a million zillion other things that I can't tell you, because I am not you. This is something you have to figure out for yourself, and usually it takes quite a while. But the best time to start is now.\n\nThe main thing to think here is this: If you start to think that everyone else is crazy, look inward instead. Cause in that case, it might just be you. And that's okay! You just have to recognize it and do something about it.\n\nThe most important thing to remember is this: because you are lonely and looking for community, lots and lots of people are trying to take advantage of that. The most obvious are cults, but there are also extremist political groups, \"sigma alpha male mindset\" folks, and it's important to remember that these communities are toxic, and will only lead you to continue not having any friends or fulfillment. **when you look for a community, don't look for one that will claim to solve all your problems. Cult, Political, or otherwise.**",

I just woke up and had this bad dream, but don't know/have anyone to tell, so I though I'd put it here.\n\nSo basically, my dream started in a movie theater, and I was watching an X-Men movie (Ive been watching those recently) when all of a sudden, I felt a girl sit beside me, lean her head against mine as she brought her hand to my hair and softly brushed it. She kept on whispering how glad she was to be here with me, watching this, and I remember tearing up. I looked at her and she looked at me and told me to \"Let it go\". I closed my eyes and cried against her, as she stroked my hair and kept whispering to me about how she's here now. Sometime later, when I opened my eyes, she was gone and the movie was over. I was suddenly outside and on my phone (dream transitions kinda suck) and saw that she messaged me, saying how much of a good time she had with me, and asked if i could visit her that night, where we could watch some demon slayer movie (which is weird cuz i dont watch any anime) and if we could play some GTA after (something I do play a lot). I remember being happy about how she wanted to play video games and watch another movie with me. As i was typing my response however, i woke up at around 6am, which is my usual time. I woke up confused and defeated, mad that it wasn't real, before getting ready for my day.\n\nUsually I log these types of dreams I have, but i really wanted to tell someone. But i wanna hear about your dreams too. Have you guys had anything like this? thanks for reading.",

I often get this feeling of \"cabin fever\" that is sometimes so strong that it feels like panic.\n\nI want to talk to you about an idea that might make you feel less lonely, like it made me.\n\nI‚Äôve built an app that uses virtual frosted glass to make video meetings more comfortable and less intrusive. The idea is to let people be present on camera \"frosted\" - without fully revealing visual details, which can help relieve the pressure of being \"on display\".\n\nI use it with a friend of mine. We both have it running automatically when Windows starts. When we both have our laptops on, we can see each other behind the virtual frosted glass. We can turn on our microphones to talk if we want. The video is reciprocal - we can only see each other when our cameras are on. We can unfrost each other with confirmation from both sides. The CPU and bandwidth usage is so low that the video can be left on.\n\nBy communicating this way, I started seeing and talking to my friend much more often. I immediately started feeling less lonely because I knew that I might see my frosted friend when I turn my laptop on.\n\nI wonder if this concept of virtual frosted glass could be useful for you against loneliness as it was for me.\n\n* Will virtual frosted glass make it less stressful for you to be on video?\n* Can virtual frosted glass encourage you to stay on video longer?\n* Will the privacy of virtual frosted glass encourage you to meet other people via video?\n\nI‚Äôd really appreciate your thoughts!\n\nLet me know in the comments if you want to try the app yourself and I will send you a link to it.",

So this is pretty much a calm, more tame type of post, while mentioning stuff I previously haven't mentioned.\n\nI have been lonely for a pretty long while. I can't remember how long it's been but I do remember memories and dreams alike of me crashing out regarding whatever situation I was in. But I genuinely believe it's getting worse as I grow older. It could be from nights of me breaking down regarding me being desperate for a partner or someone to be there for me in my lowest states, or just human nature.\n\nI've been diagnosed with depression and anxiety in my teens, obviously came from hormones as I was an attention-seeking Neanderthal around that age. But now turning 20 soon, it hasn't gotten any better. I'm still shy around everyone, I would prefer to isolate myself unless if I'm with the right people.\n\nI've mentioned that I work retail, I've been working since a few months after I graduated. I genuinely thought it would help my confidence, considering I would be forced to interact in public. And while it did work in some scenarios, it does take a toll on my mental health, as I've tried ending my life multiple times. I personally don't have a problem with my job, I have great coworkers that look out for me, customers who genuinely enjoy my presence, and that the job is easy as hell, aside the burnout in between shifts.\n\nThe biggest thing that bothers me is that considering I have coworkers I talk to on a daily. Some of them talk about their life and how great it is. Whether that'll be going out on vacation with their family, spending time with loved ones. Or hanging out outside of work. And it's like while I do hang out with my stoner friends once every week. It's like damn, There's people here genuinely doing something with their lives and all I do is work and sit at my house alone. \n\nIt gets worse when I see couples my age holding hands while walking, hugging, or whatever PDA Stuff they're doing. And to be frank, I'm not against any of that whatsoever, I'm happy of course. It's just that I never got to experience that growing up. I've had 4 girlfriends my entire life, and I have not done anything, mainly because I was scared to, thinking I was being too pushy, or too weird. I can't even say I love you to someone I'm with.\n\nTL;DR (apologies for scrolling) Been lonely for longer than I remember, too scared to find one or to be in one because I freak out, I work retail and have no life aside from work.",

If left alone without responsabilities, with all the money in the world and no one to be responsible for other than myself, I wouldn't bother making myself food, getting out of bed or trying to do anything with my money. I have never been able to visualise my future, I've felt like I was meant to die young but it hasn't happened yet or something. I'm not actively suicidal or anything. I feel guilty, I have a home, loving parents, longtime friends, I have a job and an education. I know I am priviledged so why doesn't that matter to me. An old friend of mine passed away recently, two days before he moved to another country. I think about it everyday with guilt, he had a plan and potential and worth. He truly deserved to get a fresh start. Why am I the one that lives. I am grateful for what I have but It feels unappreciated. I know there is people I can talk to but I feel alone. For the last few years even at my happiest I've always felt it in the back of my mind. I don't feel worthy of life. Nothing extremely traumatic has happened to me, I have no reason for this. I like my appearance, I have hobbies but it's all superficial. I don't hate myself either it's about my instincts why don't I put myself first.\nIf I was given the chance I'd let myself rot to death. I look around and everyone has moved on, I've felt like this for years, I don't understand why I don't care for myself, why I don't have that survival instinct. I can't even say I gave up on myself cos I don't think I was ever there. If someone tried to kill me, adrenaline aside, I don't think id run, truly I feel like I deserve it. I know I'm wasting my life why don't I care to fix it. I'm constantly asking for a sign that I'm worthy or that there is a plan for me but I know that at the end it's not real and the only person that can fix this is me. I feel like a curse on those around me and I realise I am the problem but I don't know how to ask for help.

I wasn't the one in the wrong and neither was she, I just don't know why it happened and it frankly doesn't bother me since I can't change that now. My problems with loneliness is because I find it hard to trust people who won't bully me for no reason, I was too kind and too innocent to be a ditched friend but yet this just proves that no matter who I am friends with I'll continue to suffer. This is why I want to be friends with more women because they are nice and caring for someone like me.",

People skipped out on me and now that I'm an adult people expect me to know certain things by now, but I wasn't fortunate enough to be taught certain things in school and I don't know if I can trust the internet enough to help me with it, I could read books but it's not really my specialty and I don't even know where to start on my \"certain\" subjects. That's why I ask friends that I know I could trust.

It's just after 6 or 7 years of never having a love life, it can really do a number on people, on a mental scale, and a physical scale, it makes me question my place in this world given that mostly everyone I met, ends up bullying me or not talking to me for a really long time, and on top of that I remain way more innocent than your average teenager as by now a lot of people my age are or at least had a relationship some of them even \"active\" while I couldn't even focus on that, I had to focus on myself which to be honest I don't know how to handle because I have no idea where I am messed up in despite the fact that I'm not the one who should be the messed up one yet this world seems to gaslight me into believing that I am, I don't know much about certain things and no one trustworthy is willing to teach me properly.",

For the past few months, I‚Äôve been working on an app idea, and I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts.\n\nI personally struggle with making friends and have mild social anxiety. It can be really rough some days. I‚Äôve tried a bunch of social and friend-making apps, but I‚Äôve never felt good about any of them.\n\n**The idea is simple:**\n\nInstead of focusing on dating-like profiles, awkward meetups, or curated dinners, this app gives you¬†small social challenges¬†to help you step outside your comfort zone in the real-world.\n\nIt meets you at your current social comfort levels and integrates challenges into your daily routine. For example:\n\n* If you regularly go to cafes, take public transport, or go the gym but never actually talk to anyone, it might challenge you to give a genuine compliment, start a small conversation about a suggested topic, or even just say hi.\n* The goal is to help you practice social skills in low-pressure situations for those who find it intimidating or challenging to talk to new people.\n* It can also track your progress over time and see how different challenges and situations impact your nerves or feelings of loneliness.\n\nMy philosophy is this: If I can go about my everyday life being open, curious, and willing to interact with those around me, I can naturally find acquaintances, friends, best friends, opportunities, or partners. I know this because that's how I've generally met every person I've ever met before. Even if you never see them again, spontaneous interactions make daily life much more fun and interesting anyway.\n\nI genuinely want to help, so I‚Äôd love to hear your¬†honest¬†thoughts and opinions. Would you find something like this actually useful? What sucks? What‚Äôs confusing? What‚Äôs missing?\n\nThanks!",

                        "comment": "Hey - Firstly, I'm sorry you are experiencing this.  I, myself, have felt extremely lonely and disheartened that I do not have solid friendships, nor a husband to grow and share my life with.  I will say this though - I am quite shy as well, and what I've found is that being shy often comes from being unsure about yourself.  After living alone for the past 3 years, it finally hit me.  The walls in my apartment are bare, I haven't put any color or decoration into my home to reflect who I am, and honestly, I believe it is because I have been bare inside, and also lazy.  Debilitated from my loneliness.  I haven't allowed myself to be free, take chances, do things that I've always wanted to do so that I can finally step into a confident, sure version of myself.  And my apartment reflects that.  The lack of personality and flavor that I have in this season of my life.  \n\nTry jumping out there and doing all of the things you like and love.  Even if you don't know where to start, just do different things.  Painting classes, dance classes, meetup groups.  Think outside the box on this one.  The more we LIVE the more we will find ourselves.  I believe over time that this will draw your tribe to you.  It will put you in spaces with others who have similar desires and interest.  And most importantly, when you love your own company, when you are a vibe, people become attracted to you like a moth to a flame. \n\nMy father has always told me this throughout my life, that, \"When you smile, the world smiles with you.  But when you cry, you cry alone.\"  It is so true.  Unfortunately, nobody comes to your aid to comfort you when you are always down and quiet.  I realized I've got to pick myself up and start thoroughly enjoying my life, because no one will be interested to enjoy this life with me if I don't first.\n\nHope that helps some.",

Imagine that 5 years ago you were 13yo kid playing games, but now you are closer to being adult. Those are different worlds. School will change, university, job, responsibilities. There will be lots of situations what will change perception and what seemed fitting when you were 13yo now will be different. Same with people you knew, they also will change and/or not fit with your new world. Many will move on. What is important is closest group of people, close relatives and friends. People who will hear you and when you write something to them they will pay attention even if they don't always understand you. So my answer for you is to focus on closest to you people and don't waste your time on people who just doesn't care or are too far in different reality. Perhaps they used to be your friends, but now they have grown in different person. Here also maybe partially is answer to your post's main question  - no need to share with everyone as most just won't care or understand. Have that closest group of people and share with them. Different question can be what if there are no close people, but I think it's discussed in this group a lot so maybe you can search for answers about that also.",

I always tell people, you do you. You be who you want to be & do what you want to do. Friends, significant others, they come and go. You are ALWAYS with you. Forget about everyone else. Forget about the world.",

I recognize this itself is wrong, since I also want and need the company of others. I yearn to belong and be wanted, but once the feeling of loneliness hits, I start to provoke it more. E.g. I start daydreaming of scenarios that make me cry etc etc. I also find myself imagining my future without a family and friends, sort of wishing I had none so I could really say I'm lonely, if that makes sense. Of course I don't want my family or friends to be gone, dear god no, but I get that feeling from time to time. And while I start feeling like this I also want to cry? It's not a rare occasion for me to cry in bed before I fall asleep. Why is this?\n\nOf course, the reason why I feel lonely is because I lack a proper community IRL. I do live with my family and we spend every night at least an hour of just playing UNO & eating together, but they don't fulfill this need. They're not the people I'd go first talking about my problems. This doesn't explain the previously mentioned questions, however, or then I don't realize how this lack of a community explains them.\n\n\n\nTL;DR: I sometimes feel like I'd want my family & friends be gone so I could really be lonely. While at it I also knowingly make myself cry. Don't know why.",

But I revelled in that feeling, I went outside and cried with a sort of pleasure. I didn't want anyone to come and ask me why I was crying, I just wanted to wallow in my solitary recriminations. In a way it was about vindication of my feelings: I was never jealous of my sister, but discovering the album confirmed in my mind that I wasn't loved or wanted, which I had long been suspecting but couldn't confirm.",

                        "comment": "Your in a One-Sided Relationship: A Hard but Necessary Lesson0\n\nHey, I get that this feels like a big deal right now, but trust me‚Äîthis is a common situation that a lot of high schoolers go through. Everything will be okay. There will be other girls. I know it feels like you love her with all your heart, just like you think she‚Äôs the only one, but I promise, one day you‚Äôll look back and realize this was just part of growing up.\n\nLooking back, I wouldn‚Äôt exactly call her a \"slug\"‚Äîthough it seems like there are acronyms for everything these days. But I do think our relationship was shaped more by circumstances than by real compatibility. We were constantly drinking and using substances, and if we had been sober and thinking clearly, we probably wouldn‚Äôt have even started dating in the first place.\n\nThat said, I did a lot to help her, and in return, I got nothing but a pat on the back and a ‚Äúyou‚Äôre a good friend.‚Äù And that‚Äôs exactly what‚Äôs going to happen to you. You can take the risk and tell her you like her. She might even say she likes you back. But then she‚Äôll tell you she‚Äôs confused, she can‚Äôt choose between you and the other guy, and it will drag on. Maybe she‚Äôll date you for a while, but eventually, she‚Äôll go back to him. Trust me‚ÄîI‚Äôve been there before. I‚Äôm just trying to help you avoid the same mistake.\n\nHonestly, you‚Äôre lucky no one here is roasting you for not seeing the bigger picture. It‚Äôs not about being unable to love or be loved‚Äîit‚Äôs about understanding reasoning and critical thinking.\n\nTo be clear, I don‚Äôt think she intentionally used me for money. She was around long before I had any. We had known each other for 25 years. But she definitely took advantage of the situation, knowing she had no real intention of following through. It‚Äôs not like I didn‚Äôt tell her I liked her over the years. We talked every single day. And no, she didn‚Äôt get huge gifts or financial support from me‚Äîjust small things, like flowers or little gifts under $25 from eBay.\n\nAs for why we‚Äôre no longer speaking, it‚Äôs simple‚ÄîI finally had enough. I got tired of being treated like an afterthought by someone who claimed to be my best friend.\n\nCommentary:\nIt‚Äôs easy to get caught up in emotions and believe that one person defines your world. But when a relationship is built on unstable foundations‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs emotional dependency, unbalanced effort, or external influences like substance use‚Äîit rarely leads to a healthy outcome. Recognizing when someone is not valuing you the way you deserve is tough, but setting boundaries and walking away is sometimes the best thing you can do for yourself.",

As soon as the $100,000 profit from my crypto trade was gone, she was basically out the door.\n\nIt started gradually‚Äîlittle things, like suddenly needing to \"make an appointment\" to come visit. This was a house I used to walk into without even knocking, a place I‚Äôd been going in and out of for 20 years. But all of a sudden, I had to check her schedule just to see her?\n\nAnd let me tell you, I can almost guarantee I know exactly what she‚Äôs doing now. Every once in a while, she‚Äôll throw in some sexually suggestive talk around you‚Äînot because she‚Äôs genuinely interested, but because it keeps you under her control. It‚Äôs a backup plan. If she ever suddenly needs a boyfriend and can‚Äôt find one, guess what? You‚Äôre the safety net.\n\nThat‚Äôs the sad truth. Everyone here is trying to help you, but you keep asking the same questions. I‚Äôm not trying to call you stupid, but someone made a good point‚Äîyou‚Äôre lacking a lot of common sense. And this is coming from a guy who‚Äôs only been with fewer than ten girls in his entire life.\n\nTake a step back and see the situation for what it is.",

                "text_body": "Social media has completely changed how we connect, but let‚Äôs be real, it‚Äôs not always for the better. While it helps us stay in touch, it also fuels social comparison, self-doubt, and unrealistic expectations. Seeing perfectly curated lives online can make anyone feel like they‚Äôre falling short. Studies even link excessive social media use to body dissatisfaction, anxiety, and depression.\n\nThe problem? Self-discrepancy, the gap between who we are and who we *think* we should be. Social media highlights this gap by constantly showing us idealized versions of life, making it harder to appreciate our own reality.\n\nBut it doesn‚Äôt have to be this way. Here are a few ways to protect your mental health while staying online:  \n**- Practice media literacy** ‚Äì Recognize when content is filtered or unrealistic.  \n**- Limit screen time** ‚Äì Taking breaks can boost self-esteem and reduce anxiety.  \n**- Curate your feed** ‚Äì Follow accounts that uplift you and mute the ones that don‚Äôt.  \n**- Engage in real-life connections** ‚Äì Social media shouldn‚Äôt replace meaningful offline relationships.\n\nIf you‚Äôre struggling, you‚Äôre not alone. There are plenty of resources out there to help. Prioritizing mental well-being should always come first.\n\nThat‚Äôs why platforms like Socialode are trying something different, focusing on *real* connections, not followers or fake portrayals. No likes, no pressure, just genuine friendships based on shared interests. Because social media should be a tool for connection, not comparison.",

Learn to go out alone, you are capable of having fun without friends. No it‚Äôs not embarrassing, and by passers will not laugh at you for being alone. Continue your normal life, just because you have no friends doesn‚Äôt mean you have to shut yourself out of the world. Have a positive mindset and believe whatever happens, is for the best. It‚Äôs not the end of the world, just believe in yourself. The negative stuff you think about slowly becomes true, so fix your mindset first.

It sucks because you try so hard to make friends, but sometimes, it‚Äôs like being a puzzle piece in the wrong box.\n\nOne of the biggest things no one tells you is that most people make lifelong friends in school, but we were only taught to focus on education. Then once you leave school, you realize how isolating the world can be, especially if you‚Äôre working all the time. And current social media makes it worse, it paints this fake picture that everyone‚Äôs constantly surrounded by friends when, in reality, a lot of people feel alone.\n\nThe best advice I can give is to treat making friends like dating, you have to put yourself out there, even if it feels awkward at first. There are community meetups, online groups, and even apps like Bumble BFF (not a fan, but it works for some people). If you have the means, try new experiences solo, travel, museums, random hobbies. Just doing things on your own can build confidence. And if money‚Äôs tight, focus on free community events or online groups where people share common interests.\n\nLoneliness is actually a huge issue, and it‚Äôs why I‚Äôm working on a platform to help people make real friends, not just surface-level connections. It‚Äôs not ready yet, but the goal is to make it easier for people like us to find genuine friendships.\n\nJust know you‚Äôre not alone in this, far from it. I‚Äôve felt this way my whole life, and I get how heavy it can be. But the more you put yourself in situations where meeting people is possible, the better your chances. It‚Äôs not instant, but it‚Äôs something. Keep pushing forward.",

(22M)\n\nBackstory: \nWe met in rehab when we were teenagers because we both were in for suicidal ideation. We ended up seeing each other again and rehab, and I thought it meant something because you were randomly assigned a place to go and have no control over it we kept in touch After we got released but we lived about an hour away from each other so eventually he got a girlfriend and I was blocked on everything for some reason. \n\nI moved on with my life. I got sober. I suffered a lot of hardships like losing my dad. But eventually, I moved away for college and then moved to the city of my choice to start my life. Shit hit the fan after the second move. I was super alone so I would just drown myself in work. The one family member I had down there got in a relationship and was away, so I felt like I had no one and was spiraling. I had a friend who was supposed to move in with me down there, but she too got in a relationship and decided she wasn‚Äôt gonna come. I inevitably moved back home to my hometown after trying to start over and felt very defeated and insecure I started to try to hang out with some of my old friends and then one day I got a follow request from this guy from rehab after nearly 4 or five years\n\nso I messaged him. We ended up hanging out. It was really nice. I‚Äôm the one who is pushing for it. A month into hanging out we went on our first trip. He didn‚Äôt have money so I fully paid for it myself and lied about how much it cost and told him that it was a family friends condo because I didn‚Äôt wanna make him feel insecure. It was on this trip that I started calling him My boyfrienda month and a half later I was tired of commuting an hour back-and-forth to his house so I convinced him to move to my hometown and we would split bills. Shit got really dark really fast and he kept trying to take his life in front of me with either a gun or a knife except he wasn‚Äôt actually trying to. He would secretly empty the bullets out first.  he simply just wanted to scare me and get attention. I didn‚Äôt understand because we both had come so far given our past and I was everything he could‚Äôve needed and did everything he wanted so how could he be so upset that he wanted to end his life? \n\nHe never paid his half of the rent or bills. I didn‚Äôt trust him so I didn‚Äôt actually put him on the lease. In this situation ended in him being taken away to another mental hospital and me having to call the police multiple times. We break up after only four months. And I go no contact completely for the next 11 months. In that time he called me over 10,500 from NoCallerID. \n\nThis was my first boyfriend and I was really happy with him. I enjoyed his presence and our sexual relationship. It just started to get controlling and I didn‚Äôt pick up on the red flags. My friends were there for me I recovered, but around Halloween of 2024 it didn‚Äôt sit right with me how things ended. I never got to say my piece. \n\nMy friend prank called him when we were all sitting around the fire drinking, and a girl answered the phone. I didn‚Äôt like this so later that night I called him and said I had something really important to tell him and that he needed to leave that girl. I later found out that he was homeless and jobless and using this girl who was his cousin‚Äòs baby mother for a place to stay. I didn‚Äôt intend on getting back with him. I just didn‚Äôt want him to be with anybody after what he did to me and his ex he didn‚Äôt deserve to have anyone if I had to suffer and be so lonely when I only had good intentions. \n\nI start to get mixed feelings of nostalgia and anger and I want the money that I was owed so we keep in contact because I‚Äôm really just trying to get my get back. I just don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm gonna do it yet. I end up catching feelings because I‚Äôm not a evil spiteful or revengeful person. We meet up in person to talk at a hotel parking lot. he buys me food. He gives me some cash. He even lets me strip search him to make sure he has no weapon weapons.  (Red flags I know) we were just gonna talk, but we end up having a sexual interaction. \n\nI realize that sex is a scapegoat for me as I‚Äôm now sober, and I knew he would give it to me if I asked. This escalated into us sneaking around. I would degrade him and argue with him and tell him how much he hurt me and then he would try to make me feel better physically. I had a lot going on being full-time in school working two jobs and living an hour away from him so I told him there was not much we could do other than try to keep in touch virtually and that we would see each other when we see each other. He didn‚Äôt like this and would get angry if I didn‚Äôt respond to his messages quick enough, so he found out where I worked and started calling my job. I had to cut it off. I had to block him because he was already showing red flags and mental health issues in coming in between me my work my friendships my responsibilities in my goals. \n\nFlash forward to late December. the friends I have in my life Had boyfriends and would spend a majority of their time with them. I was simply trying to distract myself with school and work and it wasn‚Äôt working. I was so lonely. I end up calling him on January 5. He answers at 2 o‚Äôclock in the morning and is telling me he doesn‚Äôt wanna talk that he‚Äôs doing good that he doesn‚Äôt need me anymore but I know that that‚Äôs a lie. We end up talking for two hours. I get clarity. He‚Äôs being very expressive and apologetic and enforcing his own boundaries which I like. Makes me think that he changed. As my friends are no longer really around and I‚Äôm going through some friendship heartbreak. I am very weak and lonely and realize I want the physical affection and comfort from my ex. \n\nI‚Äôm very busy and this time in my life as well but I still want someone. I start seeing him when I can and we mainly just chill. Watch Netflix go thrift go eat and have sex. He‚Äôs being really sweet and it‚Äôs really nice. I‚Äôm supposed to study abroad in March so in preparation for that I have to go to Atlanta every weekend for six weeks for class leading up to the trip. That‚Äôs about a 4 Hour Dr. At this time. I‚Äôm working 9:30 AM to six at night and then taking six classes in school so my time is fully called for. I find out that I have to go to Atlanta two weeks earlier than expected. This sent me into a spiral because  I was unprepared. I had my first work event on the 13th so I worked 8:30 AM to 830 at night then had to drive to Atlanta afterwards for class then had to drive back so I decided I would stay with him since it was Valentine‚Äôs Day.  then I had to work the next day from 9 AM to six or later. We start to celebrate Valentine‚Äôs Day after this busy 3 days passed . I show up at his house late Saturday night showing him the stuff I got from work, and he‚Äôs so unamused and starts making comments about the shirts not looking like something I would pick out. He says he doesn‚Äôt want a whore who wears crop tops. I‚Äôm upset because I just worked my ass off for 72 hours straight and was excited to show him my new things. he said I must not want to be with him because I didn‚Äôt immediately drop everything and touch him or kiss him this turns me off. I fall asleep in my work clothes laying on top of my arm. I wake up two hours later turn over because my arm is asleep and I guess I woke him up so he gets up out of bed, pulls the blankets off, Turns all the lights on and starts rummaging around in the kitchen for something. He says I‚Äôm using him for a place to stay and that he‚Äôs fucking done and that he doesn‚Äôt think I truly want to be with him because I keep moving and not touching him. I apologize and say I‚Äôm just really tired and that I promise everything‚Äòs OK. He says it‚Äôs not OK so I say I‚Äôll sleep on the floor so I don‚Äôt keep waking him up. He says no why don‚Äôt I get the fuck out and takes my stuff and throws it outside at 2 o‚Äôclock in the morning. I‚Äôm very scared so I end up going And putting all my stuff in my car because I also have my dog with me. I‚Äôm so tired from all my hard work that I fall asleep in my car without even knowing it I wake up and it‚Äôs about 6 AM.  I‚Äôm really confused so I go bang on his door to let me back in Because I also need to use the bathroom. He says that I can‚Äôt use him for a place to use the bathroom or a place to sleep, but he lets me in anyways the next day we get up and he starts an argument about me not having him on social media Every time I add him on social media he picks a fight about random strangers in my follow list so one of my boundaries was him not monitoring my social media. He goes and grabs all my shit again and throws it outside. My computer included, which is what I used to do my schoolwork on and work on. I called the cops, but he cleans everything up before they get there. the cops didn‚Äôt believe me I left and went home crying my eyes out not understanding how he could do this to me. \n\nWe didn‚Äôt talk for a week and then the next weekend I spend the weekend with my family. On this weekend, I got the flu started my period two weeks early and also had to quit vaping Cold Turkey. I was not doing well. I was out of work for half the week and then it came down for me to make another trip to Atlanta for class. I asked everyone I knew to help me get there to drive me everyone in my support group, and they all said no. I was getting on the road late at night closer to 730 and the person I usually stay with called me and said that it was too late and then I would be better off driving up in the morning but it‚Äôs four hours so I would have to wake up at 3 AM and leave by four. Not knowing what to do with my stress I get super overwhelmed and I call my abuser and beg him to please take the day off and drive me to Atlanta I‚Äôm in desperate need of some help. I‚Äôm so stressed. I‚Äôm having panic attacks and I feel like I can‚Äôt take care of myself or get myself there safely. He agrees and we have a good night and a good morning I get to class I do class and we were good to go from there. We walk around campus we go to lunch and he starts making comments to me about the guys on campus asking me which ones did I fuck. I‚Äôm an online student most of the time and never met anyone in my time living in Atlanta or the other city of my choice Like literally nobody I almost thought something was wrong with me because no one ever hits on me or tries to be my friend this is why I latch onto him, but he truly doesn‚Äôt believe me. We‚Äôre on the way back in the car. He‚Äôs getting road rage. He‚Äôs arguing with me about the emojis that are in my recently used emojis he‚Äôs arguing with me about me googling why little baby got arrested. He‚Äôs saying that I must not be into him if I‚Äôm googling other men who wear black ( he‚Äôs white) he‚Äôs blasting music on full volume in my car when I‚Äôm trying to do schoolwork. I ask him to please turn it down and I tell him I don‚Äôt like the song he‚Äôs playing because they‚Äôre very manipulative and shit light on the kind of relationship we have. He‚Äôs increasingly more frustrated. He‚Äôs arguing with me. He‚Äôs telling me his head is fucked up and that it‚Äôs really bad this time and that I make him worse. So we write in silence. We had left at 4 AM that morning so we were both very tired. I do school work in the car until we‚Äôre about 15 minutes away from home in that car ride. He had asked me if I had met God yet and started playing Christian music, but he doesn‚Äôt go to church or talk about God or listen to Christian music so I found it really scary the whole time I was thinking damn I really wanted to love him and be loved in return but I‚Äôve gotta leave him alone. He‚Äôs dangerous. We‚Äôre driving on a back road and about 10 minutes away from home. I close my eyes briefly to rest thinking that I‚Äôm gonna have to drive an hour home after I drop him off, not even two seconds after I close my eyes I hear a loud noise and open my eyes to us flying through the air at 65 miles an hour. We crashed into a ditch and I can‚Äôt see anything and I‚Äôm in shock and in pain. My glasses were missing so he helps me find them but other than that he didn‚Äôt do anything. He didn‚Äôt scream he didn‚Äôt cuss. He didn‚Äôt check on me. I had to tell him to call 911 when police got there he claimed it was a deer. We go to the hospital and he just starts yelling at me about everything when I can‚Äôt even walk and I‚Äôm moaning and groaning in pain. My car is totaled. My glasses are damaged. My computer is damaged and I can‚Äôt afford to miss work or school when I‚Äôm supposed to be going to Dubai in two weeks for a study abroad. All hell breaks loose once I get home from this incident I blocked him on everything, but none of my friends were here for me because they found out I was with him. The same friends I asked for a ride, but it wouldn‚Äôt take off work to help me. I was desperate and I did have a good first half of the day with him. I don‚Äôt understand why things went so wrong. I don‚Äôt understand why he would do such a thing and drive off the road. My life already felt hard and now it was 10 times harder. No one has been here for me since not my mom not my friends. In fact, they blocked me on everything. They happen to work at the doctors office I go to and they actually have threatened to drop me as a patient and refuse to answer my phone calls when I called to book appointments. I live in a small town in this doctors office was the best care I could get. My back and leg are still fucked. I‚Äôve had multiple x-rays and multiple MRIs and I‚Äôm just waiting to hear back on what‚Äôs wrong. I wasn‚Äôt able to walk for three days. He has called my phone over 800 times from no caller ID. He even called my job. I could now lose my job over this. I almost wasn‚Äôt able to still go on the trip to Dubai because my professor found out about the wreck. Everything is 10 times harder I‚Äôm all alone. No one calls no one checks on me. I don‚Äôt know what to do with my stress. I‚Äôm very depressed. Every time I go to sleep I have nightmares every time I wake up it‚Äôs even more of a nightmare I‚Äôve missed a lot of work because of this situation and now he‚Äôs coming between me and my job. I hate him but part of me still love him. It‚Äôs ridiculous but all I wanna do is have sex because that‚Äôs the only thing I know works to clear my head and I now don‚Äôt have access to any of that. I‚Äôm desperate to be loved. I‚Äôm desperate to be sought after.  But no one gives a single fuck. I‚Äôm just all alone trying to fathom how someone could do this to me trying to fathom how my friends gonna abandon me in a time like this trying to fathom how I‚Äôm supposed to move forward alone until further notice. Everything is uncomfortable, and my head has turned into a very uncomfortable place to be. I‚Äôm trying to stay organized. I‚Äôm going to all my doctors appointments and I‚Äôm going to therapy and I‚Äôm gonna go back to work. I‚Äôm behind on school, but I‚Äôm doing everything I can to catch back up and ask for extensions. I‚Äôve been praying about it, but I don‚Äôt have any clarity yet. I really just want someone to love and love me back and be there at the end of the day And respect my goals in my boundaries. I‚Äôve thought about calling him, but if I do, then the police will never believe me when something else happens. I just want company and I have none. What in the world am I supposed to do? Life is now excruciating I feel like I created the suffering for myself by being weak and drowning myself and work as a result, I‚Äôve lost almost everything except for my life. I‚Äôm so lonely. Everything hurts. I don‚Äôt know what to do. Can someone please help?",

I've never been married, I'm an only child and my last living relative died from old age 15 years ago.

In my 40 year career I've traveled to most countries and areas in our amazing world.

I have always thought of myself to be a very likeable person, i always know how to make people laugh, i'm constantly told i'm smart, i'm in great shape because i workout regularly and i always try to keep my higiene on pristine condition. However, since middle school i have always struggled with my love life, because ever since i started taking real interest in girls my age i am always rejected, the first years it was not a big deal, i used to think that this was just a one time occurrence and that'd be it, but ever since i think i have tried flirting with at least 10 girls and all of them had the same reaction, whenever i made my intentions clear they always either rejected me or started ghosting me.\n\nI'm not gonna lie, there's a finite number of rejections i can take before i start doubting everything about myself, some of those girls said some really hurtful things about me that little by little started deteriorating my self-steem. Every time i take interest in a woman i always convince myself that this time is going to be different, but it always ends up the same; she loves spending time with me, looks for ways to be with me, starts the conversation, etc. But whenever i try to ask them out on a date or something similar, i always get the same rejection from all of them, i just don't understand how people can be so affectionate and close to me, but then almost feel repulsed by me when i try to take things further.\nI am on my early 20's so friends my age are already dating, enjoying their love/sex life, getting into relationships, having girls try to fliirt with them, but i don't get to do any of that, i don't understand, am i not worthy of love? Am i that ugly? Is it because of something else?\nEveryday that passes i just feel more awkward in my own body, i don't understand why i don't get to live a life like people my age, i'm 21 years old and i still don't know what it's like to have someone love me, to recieve a hug from someone who likes me, to kiss or even be intimate with a person. I feel extremely excluded and it feels like all my attempts at improving the situation are useless, every single time i talk to my close friends about a girl i'm starting to know they always try their best to help me, but the result even after their help is always the same.\n\nSorry for the long post but i had to get this off my chest, i just don't feel like trying anymore and just accept that i'm not built for experiencing lovr",

I'm not yet even 20, as I'm only turning 19 this year, but while I was reading your post I was pretty much just checking all the boxes.  \n\"I have always thought of myself to be a very likeable person, i always know how to make people laugh, i'm constantly told i'm smart, i'm in great shape because i workout regularly and i always try to keep my higiene on pristine condition\"  \nCheck, check, check, check, check. I look good, I dress nicely, I work out for 3,5 hours a week, I'm good at school, I'm good at telling stories. Of course, our experiences differ a bit since I'm a woman and you're a guy, but the feeling is the same. Now, I haven't asked many people out, only once to be exact, so I can't fully relate to being continuously rejected. The two times I've been asked out were when a guy was drunk and the other one was around 17 years older than me. Point is, there isn't a rain of date invitations for me either. And I don't expect there to be any, of course, if I were to like someone I'd ask them out myself. But yeah, back to your story.   \n\"¬†i still don't know what it's like to have someone love me, to recieve a hug from someone who likes me, to kiss or even be intimate with a person. I feel extremely excluded and it feels like all my attempts at improving the situation are useless\"  \nMost nights I fall asleep imagining someone is hugging me or something. Other times I cry because I fear that one day I'll realize I'm on my 40s and the only love I receive is coming from an imaginary cat I have in this scenario. It's really, really f\\*cking scary. I've also asked my closest friends to not talk about how successful their love lives are since it reminds me of my own needs that aren't met. It's like, you know, watching other people sailing on the sea while I'm just stading on the shore and wondering if I should just build a house here.  \nI'd also like to point out something that might be explaining the strength of our crushing feelings, at least a bit. I've watched a couple of video essays and read multiple articles about how love has evolved through time, and one thing in particular has been highlighted again and again: We expect our partner to be all we need. Like, a rival who encourages you to be a better human, a mentor who can give you advice, a friend who will do stupid shit with you, a whole community that tells you you're needed & wanted. Now, I'm not saying a partner should not be these things, no, but the cold truth is that one person can't fulfill all those roles.  (I know this and yet I keep imagining that one magical person who will say abracadabra and puff all my lonely feelings are gone.) Anyway, if you have most of those relationship needs already fulfilled, then it's easier to be happy and not feel at least as strong need for someone. I've personally noticed I tend to forget the need for romantic love if I'm already feeling like I belong. For example, playing a tabletop roleplaying game: there's a concrete group of people, we spend time together and work out different problems together. I don't need to wish for someone, because I'm already feeling needed & wanted & liked. Ofc I don't have sex or romantic candlelight dates with them but you get the point. Hopefully.\n\nAnyway, I don't know how to end this comment, but in case you want to talk more about these things I'm happy to do so (:",

In early 2023 i bumped into one of her female friends on the gym and i asked her if she knew why the other girl stopped hanging out with us, and she told me that she had recently moved to another city but i don't think that explains why she ghosted me while still living close to the rest of us.",

There are many reasons why loneliness has become an issue. Most of them are rooted in the development of our societies: the deterioration of our communities, change in values and change in social interaction (Social Media).\n\nFirst, I do agree that you should probably get a job. This will have two positive effects: first of all, you will have more money to spend, and second you are exposed to people and potentially find friends.\n\nSecond, you can go to certain organizations and do charity. Charity is one of the most rewarding activities, which actually is having a significant impact on the one giving/doing the charity. Additionally, also here you have the chance to befriend like minded people.\n\nIt is also ok to reach out to grandparents or other relatives. In general, I would say, people are more helpful and supportive than we sometimes assume. It's ok to ask for help.\n\nIt is also ok to be proactive. To ask that friend group that you mentioned about some activities. Maybe you have been passive and just wanted them to ask you. But you haven't asked them proactively once. I think, at some point people just want to see some proactiveness.\n\nAfter all, what's important to consider is that most of our feelings are just a mix of different hormones. What we seek when we are lonely is a mix of Oxytocin and Dopamine. There are different ways to get these hormones naturally. So, for example just talking to a cashier or barista in a friendly, short conversation can increase your Oxytocin.\n\nVery important is to be aware that this all will take a while, probably year to really feel that you belong.\n\nI have an article that I found about this topic, which might help you somehow: [https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/surgeon-general-social-connection-advisory.pdf](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/surgeon-general-social-connection-advisory.pdf)\n\nBest",

Have you ever found yourself scrolling through your feed, seeing everyone else‚Äôs highlight reels, and feeling more alone than ever?\n\n# Why Does This Happen?\n\nSocial media creates the illusion that everyone else is living their best life, while we‚Äôre stuck comparing ourselves in real time. It‚Äôs easy to forget that what we see online is often a curated version of reality.\n\nSometimes, even when we‚Äôre technically \"connected,\" the interactions can feel shallow. Comment sections, likes, and quick replies don‚Äôt always replace real conversations and meaningful connections.\n\n# What Can Help?\n\nIf social media has been making you feel more isolated, here are a few things that might help:\n\n* **Be mindful of how certain platforms make you feel.** If scrolling through a certain app leaves you feeling worse, consider limiting your time on it.\n* **Prioritize real connections.** Reach out to a friend, even if it's just to check in. A simple conversation can make a big difference.\n* **Curate your feed.** Follow accounts that inspire or uplift you instead of ones that make you feel like you‚Äôre missing out.\n* **Engage more meaningfully.** Instead of just liking posts, try commenting or starting a conversation.\n\n# You‚Äôre Not Alone\n\nLoneliness is something many people experience, even when surrounded by online interactions. It‚Äôs okay to talk about it, and you‚Äôre not the only one who feels this way.\n\nHave you ever felt lonelier because of social media? What helps you deal with it?

I think it creates a really false image of life, like it‚Äôs just a highlight reel of people showing off six-pack abs, luxury vacations, and fancy cars. For a lot of people, scrolling through that every day can be depressing because it makes it seem like that‚Äôs what life *should* look like, when in reality, most of us are just living normal lives.\n\nIt‚Äôs not that people can‚Äôt achieve those things, but life doesn‚Äôt work like an Instagram feed where everyone‚Äôs rich, successful, and constantly on vacation. It almost feels like a slap in the face, especially for people who are working hard to build something meaningful. Instead of feeling motivated, it can just be a constant reminder of what you *don‚Äôt* have yet.\n\nThat‚Äôs why I think platforms like Reddit are refreshing, it‚Äôs just people having real conversations instead of trying to flex their lifestyle. Of course, there‚Äôs still no platform that truly connects people based on interests in a meaningful way, which is actually something I‚Äôm working on right now. Hopefully, that‚Äôll be launching in the next year.\n\nAs for Twitter (or X), it‚Äôs basically just a giant microphone where everyone‚Äôs talking, but no one‚Äôs really listening.

You think you have these lifelong friends, but life happens, people move, start new jobs, get caught up in their own worlds. Before you know it, the friends you once counted on are distant memories. It‚Äôs not that they don‚Äôt care; it‚Äôs just how life unfolds. And yeah, it sucks.\n\nOnce you‚Äôre out of school, the world can feel like a lonely place. No built-in community, no easy way to meet people. Everyone‚Äôs busy, everyone‚Äôs chasing something, and real friendships start feeling rare. But you‚Äôre not alone in this. I honestly believe most people feel this way at some point, they just don‚Äôt talk about it.\n\nThe fact that you‚Äôve had a meaningful relationship before shows that you *can* build connections, and that‚Äôs huge. A lot of people struggle with even that. But I get why it feels pointless to try again. People come and go, and sometimes it‚Äôs hard to trust that anyone will stick around. It makes you wonder, what‚Äôs the point?\n\nFor me, I had to shift my mindset. Instead of waiting for friendships to happen like they did in school, I started putting myself in new situations, just for myself. I went skydiving once just because I felt like it. And the more I did things for *me*, the more I ran into people who actually shared my interests. I stopped worrying about what others thought and just started *doing*.\n\nThat‚Äôs actually why I‚Äôm building something right now, a platform to help people form *real* connections, no social media BS, no follower counts, no fake clout. Just a way for people to meet others who actually get them. Because I know how isolating this world can be, and I don‚Äôt think it has to be this way.\n\nI won‚Äôt give you the usual ‚Äúit gets better‚Äù line, because honestly, there‚Äôs no magic fix. But what I *do* know is that you‚Äôre not the only one sitting in a dark room on a Friday night feeling this way. A lot of us are. And as much as it sucks, life does keep moving. The best thing you can do is keep putting yourself out there, not for others, but for *you*. New experiences, new opportunities, they *will* come. Just don‚Äôt give up on yourself.",

I long to hear someone say 'thanks for doing a great job this week. Let's grab some Dutch Bros. My treat.'\n\nInstead here I sit, in our motel room, hearing only her.",

It always felt like I was starting over socially, and despite trying a lot of the usual suggestions, I often felt stuck.\n\nOver the last four months, I‚Äôve been working on something I wish I had back then ‚Äî a platform called ActivityBuddy. It‚Äôs a place where you can book people to join you for activities like getting food, playing video games, or going for a walk (as long as it‚Äôs legal). The idea is to make it easier to find someone to share moments with, without the pressure of building an immediate friendship.\n\nWhen you‚Äôre feeling lonely, the options can be limited:\n\n* **Family or existing friends:** If you have close relationships, that‚Äôs amazing ‚Äî but not everyone has that, and sometimes even the people closest to you can‚Äôt fully understand what you‚Äôre going through.\n* **Making new friends:** This can take a lot of time and effort, especially as an adult. Friendships often form through work, hobbies, or events, but it can be hard to break through surface-level connections and build something deeper.\n* **Online interactions:** Watching content or chatting online can ease loneliness temporarily, but it doesn‚Äôt always fill the need for real, in-person connection.\n* **Therapy or counseling:** Talking to a professional can be incredibly helpful, but it‚Äôs not the same as having a casual, human-to-human conversation with someone who shares your interests.\n\nI built ActivityBuddy as a small step toward filling that gap:\n\n* You can pick an activity you enjoy and have someone join you, on your schedule.\n* There‚Äôs no pressure to maintain a friendship ‚Äî just share an experience when you want to.\n* You choose the people you want to meet, which can make socializing feel safer and less intimidating.\n* Spending time with others face-to-face can help improve social skills and build confidence.\n* And who knows? Even without pressure, some connections might grow into real friendships.\n\nWe just launched in the Miami and Tampa metros, so if this sounds like something you‚Äôd be interested in (or if you have feedback), I‚Äôd love to hear it. Even if this platform isn‚Äôt the right fit, I hope you find something that brings more connection and joy into your life.",

                "text_body": "Let me start by saying I‚Äôve been battling loneliness for as long as I can remember. It‚Äôs like a shitty roommate who never pays rent and eats all my snacks.\n\nGrowing up, my parents were so authoritarian that sharing my thoughts with them felt riskier than discussing politics at Thanksgiving. So, I just‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt. At school, I was labeled a weirdo, though no one ever gave me the courtesy of an explanation. In high school, I decided to conform, which miraculously made the loneliness chill out for a bit. Turns out, blending in works, until you realize you‚Äôve blended yourself into oblivion.\n\nAt 19, I moved to a foreign European country and figured, ‚ÄúHey, new place, new me!‚Äù So I became the ‚Äòyes‚Äô guy. The clown. The one who would rather endure six hours in a deafening nightclub as an introvert than sit alone with my thoughts, which, let‚Äôs be honest, are mostly just anxiety-ridden existential rants. Loneliness felt like a full-body rash everywhere, inescapable, and only numbed by dissociating from reality.\n\nFast-forward to 30: most of the friends I made scattered across the globe, and I got tired of playing a role that wasn‚Äôt me. I decided to be myself, do what I actually enjoy, and, spoiler alert, loneliness came back with a vengeance. Turns out, the things that interest me are so niche that they make quantum physics look mainstream. So, I picked up smoking weed to deal with the solitude, which worked wonders‚Ä¶ if my goal was to feel even more alone and miserable the next morning. After a few years of that genius coping strategy, I quit and refocused on personal growth.\n\nNow, after many hours of introspection (read: arguing with myself like a crazy person), I‚Äôve come to a few realizations about loneliness that I‚Äôd love to throw out there and see if anyone else relates:\n\n\t‚Ä¢\tLonely people tend to crave depth over quantity. We‚Äôre geeks. Emotional nerds.\n\t‚Ä¢\tMany of us have been rejected or bullied for who we are, so we‚Äôve learned to mask it.\n\t‚Ä¢\tSince we hide our true selves, we hesitate to share what‚Äôs really on our minds‚Äîbecause let‚Äôs face it, getting a blank stare or awkward silence in response to your deepest thoughts kinda sucks.\n\t‚Ä¢\tWe often choose relationships based on ‚ÄúThis is my only option right now, so either this person or loneliness.‚Äù Shockingly, picking a mismatched partner just to feel less alone somehow makes you feel even lonelier.\n\t‚Ä¢\tWe get so used to feeling lonely that when something pulls us out of it, we reject it. And then we complain about being lonely again. (10/10 self-sabotage.)\n\t‚Ä¢\tI couldn‚Äôt care less about trends and superficial small talk. The idea of discussing last night‚Äôs reality TV drama makes me want to chew glass.\n\nI don‚Äôt have all the answers. I still feel lonely a lot. But I‚Äôve learned to talk myself through it, like the best friend I always wished I had. It helps, sometimes.\n\nDo I still question the point of existence? Yeah. But I‚Äôve also developed an equally strong counter-thought, thanks to metaphysics and spirituality:\n‚ÄúBeing alone feels like hell, but maybe hell is exactly what I need right now, so I might as well make it as enjoyable as possible.‚Äù\n\nYour thoughts?",

It's not healthy to rely your whole life and emotional state on one single person who is just as imperfect and prone to doing mistakes as you are. In and out's, cheating, insecurities, abuse, jealousy disinterest, all of that is is extremely common in a relationship and you can't allow what happens with your partner to be constantly affecting your personal life and your relations with others.\n\nI understand you want to feel loved, but there's ways to do so without having to put your whole life into one person, at this point i personally would value more a great close friend instead of a romantic partner, since many of the problems that come from having a partner are non-existant with a friendship.\n\nGetting a girlfriend won't fix your life.",

There is a set of circumstances that make us lonely and it is not a choice.\n\nWe do have a choice to break though but what people don't understand is that it is very difficult to react since loneliness can be so debilitating.\n\nSometimes we ask for help and people think we need to be \"well with ourselves before we can get vured from it\". So they simply don't make us company and just teach us to be our own friend, to keep company to our own selves. That's cruel.\n\nThey say it's not a disease but they don't hold our hands. It's like they are afraid to catch it. So, they give advices and stay away from us.\n\nYou are sick and you need care. I hope a higher power (if I cannot say God over here) helps you. I need the same help. This world is supposed to be perceived as evil, because it is. But there are the ones that are awake and there are the ones that want to be deceived.

                        "comment": "Im 49 years old and ive experienced loneliness in my own life a LOT. Ill tell you what i believe it is, is basically weve destroyed normal human life.  We dont have a group/tribe/village anymore. We all live a lot of us in these giant cities where it feels like people are cockroaches on top of one another or ants. Nobody really takes the time to talk to each other or know their neighbors, theres no communication, no sense of community, and the main thing no connection.\n\nYou can be surrounded by people, drowning in them and without connection its worse than being alone. I feel less alone when im alone than i do with people a lot of the time. Because people are just a reminder of how i dont fit and theres nobody like me. A lot of people feel this way im sure. We are not supposed to have individuality that could help the tribe if it existed, to innovate and try new ways of doing things. We are all supposed to be the same in this gigantic gray blob. Its even hard coded into our DNA. Do you know that what most of us find the most attractive is faces that are similar to other faces weve seen before. Thats on a cellular level to procreate. So a lot of it is how we are hardwired.\n\nI seen a video or read about this somewhere but i cant remember the source now. But theres an apartment building in one of the Nordic countries (sorry dont remember which one atm). That all the apartments have no kitchens in them. They have one giant communal kitchen and the entire apartment building goes down there to make food and the people take turns. Their kids play together, they get to know their neighbors and even have group events and people seem genuinely a lot happier it was report.  I also read where a study said people that live in the country are a LOT happier than those that live in cities. I am from a small town, and live with my fiancee now in a small city (according to her it being small lol). But i really miss having space and knowing most of my neighbors and just feeling like i was part of a community. We had a natural disaster here a while back, a flood, im in North Carolina. It destroyed a lot of the infrastructure here we had no power or running water for about a month or more. My fiancee and I went to check on the neighbors and we met some of them for the first time we wouldnt have otherwise. That was a really good feeling. Just the simple act of knowing the people around you. But normally like now we had a new neighbor move in. Shes litterally right across the street, i have no idea what her name even is. I dont know about you but i dont want to live that way. Im trying to figure out a way we can meet her and hopefully become friends. But its all so awkward and almost like society is settup so were all supposed to mind our own business and not even talk to one another.\n\nIt all comes down to this. We need community, its a basic human requirement that is literally part of who we are since the dawn of history. People, due to technology that claims to connect us, separating us at every given turn through politics, and tribalism and social engineering at every turn are losing their basic social skills. A lot of kids now a days dont even know how to just go up and talk to somebody. So they try to do it through their phones or computers. Case and point how we are now on reddit.  Im 49 like i said and its been an issue since i was a kid,so its not a new problem its been around a while. I have bad social anxiety, avoidant tendencys and it all comes from not having those experiences that people in earlier times had just by the way society was setup. We need community and constant interaction with the same people so that we can connect with them and let down our boundaries and create friendships. Most people just work or go to school and come home and we dont have time to even try to be social, just trying to survive. No time for whats important in life. Just stupid money and whatever the flavor of the week is. I can really relate to people like mcandless i think his name was who just burned and cut up all his money and credit cards and went to live in the alaskan wilderness. It seems very tempting at times. I mean if youre gonna be alone anyway, why not be surrounded by beautiful nature right? lol\n\nLoneliness at its core is a lack of connection. To combat it we need to create connection again. Through community and to make it a priority EVERYBODY has vital experiences like meeting and making new friends, working together as a group to overcome things etc.  Its as simple as that. But with technology like the internet that claims to bring us together but does nothing but separate us at every turn its going to be an uphill battle.\n\nI hope that eventually they study this and things are done to help the lonely people of the world. To rebuild community and give people hope again. Right now we are just too isolated as a whole. People need to learn to ignore the current manufactured \"tribalism\" like politics, race, how much money you make, social status etc and realize we are ALL human beings and we should love and try to help one another and stand together when one of us needs help.\n\nI honestly think the key to what we can do is individuals though is just be kind to one another. Thats the one thing we can for sure control. Kindness is the key. If you see somebody struggling, try to help if youre able, or even if youre not just stop to say, hey man i see you and im here. Telling somebody youre sorry does nothing, but standing in the dark with them does. Lets them know theyre not alone.",

My family got divorced and for about 6 yrs I had lived with my mother meanwhile my elder brother (about 8 years older than me) lived still today with father, before my uni had started I was shifted with my father while my mother married another man and settled abroad. For a year or a half I cried and weeped for almost every day and I had became so depressed because I missed my mother and my father and brother were always toxic and unsupportive, they only try to be nice but at every critical moment they scolded and threatened to kick me out of the house almost every time every time I screw something or do something that I like they want to control everything even the haircut I keep can't be of my choice cus they don't like even a tiny bit long hair ,they always backbite and look for every little reason to intoxicate me and still for all the things they do they expect me to give them family time. But I learn from my mistakes and decided to avoid them at almost all costs .My mother called me almost every day till today and at start I used to tell her about every single thing because I didn't have any real friends, but slowly I avoided her too because of her husband who didn't like her talking about anyone but them. Also when I told her about how lonely I felt sometimes she would start to laugh and didn't get about how I felt which broke my heart certain times until I was mature enough to keep things to myself. My mother would sometimes become very emotional which causes both families disturbance as she begs her husband to bring her back to my country which caused fights even sometimes she calls my brother about my feelings (I never share anything private with my brother or Father) which makes my brother mad and he scolds as usual. One time my mom and I came up with an idea of having a pet since there was no one I could talk to or spend time with because I spend all of my Time in my room but father refused (because I wasn't a good son) and it would be costly for them (we are financially decent) even I cried in front of them they wouldn't take any step to help me heal even though they noticed that I have became a very quiet person (I was a very confident person before all this) \nCurrently I have became null as I don't listen my emotional needs like talking to someone or spending time . There isn't single woman in the house after my mom oh God I miss feminity so much that soft and sweet voice for waking you up that lap so you could lay your head down those soft hands you could hold that person you can talk about anything all of that has gone Seeking feminity so bad I always think about how beautiful my life would be After marring the right girl, of course I crush on some girls don't have the confidence to talk to them so I would just look at them and avoid eye contact hoping they don't think me as a creep anyway after study I spend my spare time laying in my dark bedroom all depressed, suicidal, and tired filled with anger just wishing for my life be taken automatically one day so that I could rest forever.

                "text_body": "As the title says, today was my birthday (35M), and as expected, nobody cared or did anything. To be precise, I only received a WhatsApp message from my mother, who is the only person I have in my life right now. She is quite old and lives in my home country.\n\nI never had many friends, mostly acquaintances. I did have a girlfriend some years ago; we were together for several years, but unfortunately, the relationship was very toxic for me. She was extremely jealous and violent, and we eventually broke up.\n\nAfter that, I tried to reset my life, to set a new and ambitious goal and pursue it. In doing so, I left everything behind. I also took the opportunity to reflect on my loneliness and to work on being better, to actively try to do things right, to recognize my mistakes, and to improve what I could control. I got in good shape, learned to take care of myself, to look good, to go to the gym consistently, and to improve whatever could be improved, to become the best version of myself and, by extension, a good prospect as a friend and a partner.\n\nWhen it came to interactions with others, I became kinder, more respectful. I offered help whenever I could, even when it wasn‚Äôt asked for. I tolerated things I normally wouldn‚Äôt. I listened and offered support. I genuinely wanted to be a good person.\n\nHowever, none of that worked at all. I am absolutely and completely alone. My phone never receives messages from anyone, other than group messages related to academic activities and spam. Sometimes, I crave something as simple as a hug, just wishing I had someone to hold. For several reasons, I can‚Äôt have a pet, and even if I could, what I need is human interaction.\n\nOver the years, birthdays have been the worst days of all, for obvious reasons. They‚Äôre when I most strongly feel my loneliness and my longing for someone in my life. But this time, something was different. I guess it was resignation. I didn‚Äôt feel anything particularly worse than the usual sadness and pain. I think I‚Äôve finally accepted my reality, and that it can‚Äôt be changed. I think I no longer have any tears left. I feel dry inside. ",

However, after spending time in a friendgroup (that I got kicked out of BECAUSE two of the people in the friendgroup had an argument with two of my other friends outside of the friendgroup...storytime=for another time) for under a year, the sheer awkwardness of the group when I was in it (like how it felt when talking to them, or even watching how they interacted with each other (which was the same with when they interacted with me) was honestly super awkwardd (E.G. real awkward silences n everything)) and I sincerely believe that that may be one of the more significant things that had led to my incapabilities in reverting back to my outgoing nature (in addition to my response to the rumors that were directly about me as well, which were all false). Now since we have to prepare for our GCSE's, my (new) friends (in my current friendgroup) and I are studying/revising independently so we don't go out as much as I'd like....at all, so I honestly don't feel like this is good practice for the next school at all >:( ...But they're lovely so it's okayy :)\n\nReason I'm moving schools: In the UK, high school practically ends at 16 but a Canadian high school would end at 18 so :) ..... im not running away",
