1jwnf53,To the people I love,"**To the People I Love,**

I’ve been thinking about how to write this, and I keep starting and stopping because nothing ever feels like enough. How do you explain something that’s been quietly unraveling inside for so long? How do you say goodbye when all you’ve ever wanted was to keep holding on?

The truth is, I’m tired. Not just sleepy or worn out—I mean the kind of tired that sits deep in your bones. The kind that no amount of sleep, or sunshine, or talking it out can fix. I've tried to keep going, to keep smiling, to keep being the version of me that you all know and love. But inside, it’s been so heavy for so long. And I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry that it’s come to this.

This isn’t about any one thing or any one moment. It’s been a slow burn—a daily battle with thoughts that don’t quiet, pain that doesn’t ease, and a feeling of being lost in a world that just keeps moving. I’ve fought silently because I didn’t want to worry you. I didn’t want to be a burden. But the truth is, I’ve been struggling in ways I couldn’t always put into words. I’ve felt invisible and overwhelmed, even when surrounded by love. And even when I knew how deeply I was cared for, I couldn't always feel it through the fog.

Please don’t think this is your fault. It’s not. You were never the reason—I promise. If anything, you were the reason I held on for as long as I did. Your love, your laughter, your presence—it kept me going on the days I thought I couldn’t. I’m endlessly grateful for every hug, every message, every silly moment and serious talk. I truly hope I gave you even a fraction of the comfort you gave me.

I know this will hurt. And that thought breaks my heart more than anything. But I need you to understand that I’ve reached a point where the pain inside is louder than the hope. I’m exhausted—not from life itself, but from the weight I’ve been carrying every single day. And I don’t want to keep pretending I’m okay when I’m not. I just can’t anymore.

I don’t know if this will bring peace or confusion. I don’t expect understanding, but I do hope for compassion. I hope that in time, you’ll remember me not for how I left, but for how I loved. How I tried. How I always wanted to make you laugh. How I cherished you—because I did, with all my heart.

Take care of each other. Please keep checking in on the quiet ones. Be gentle with the world and even more gentle with yourselves. And if you ever find yourself where I’ve been, please reach out. You are never weak for hurting. You are never alone, even if it feels that way.

Thank you for giving me moments of joy in the midst of my darkness. Thank you for seeing me, even when I felt invisible. Thank you for everything.

I love you.

Recently down im feeling really down and very volatile about what i do though: one moment im trying to do my best, the other im very confused and disconnected from reality. I must say im getting a little biti disinterested in what i study not because i feel tired, but im overwhelmed most of the time because of my relationships (im not talking about romantic partners, just friendship and acquaintences). I also spend 2 hours a day in a train to get home...this is the most frustrating part of the day: the noise, the chaos, exacerbate the dissociated feeling and i must say a bit of paranoia that something bad is happening to me and that someone might hurt me. I sometimes hear a buzz in one ear and an indisctinct voice, sometime the voice is aggressive, suggesting s\*icide. I dont feel like i am s\*icidal though (like im programming s\*icide).

1jx2q2d,Married for 16 years. Sudden life event has changed everything,"I 40/f have been married to my husband 47/m for 16 years. We have 3 kids together, and are your typical middle class working family. He has always been strong in his faith, where I have never been. He would occasionally try to get me to go to church with him and the kids, but I never felt like I wanted to do that. 

Spring forward to November 2023. My husband had a sudden mental crisis, which landed him the hospital for a few days. For clarity, he had zero, mental health issues prior. No depression, no anxiety, nothing. It was scary and my world shattered. It was the hardest thing I’ve ever went through.

He has never been the same since. He is extremely religious now, and everything is about god. This makes me so uncomfortable, and yes I have talked to him about it. He says what he went through was spiritual and that I need to get close to god. Again, scary for me. 

He still works, takes on the same household jobs, he’s still the same, great dad and he’s a pretty dang good husband. My problem, and yes it’s probably very selfish, but I feel like my old husband died. He doesn’t celebrate Halloween, anymore. He doesn’t watch scary movies like he used to, he doesn’t curse, or watch the news like we always did. He prays a lot. And reads he Bible all the time. I just feel that the man I married and fell in love with is in a sense, dead. And this man is someone new I am trying so hard to accept and love.

1jwz8k2,Someone Gave Me A Reason To Live,"Hi. Second Post here :)

The past few weeks have been really rough and just extremely difficult for myself mentally dealing with depression and self loathing and I haven’t been talking to anyone about it. After school today I took the bus, not knowing where I’d go in all honesty and thinking that I wanted to find a way to hurt myself or potentially end it. 

I decided if I was going to, I wanted to do something nice for myself. So I went to Target and bought something I liked to collect, just for a last bit of happiness. 

I went to self check out and unfortunately it was all card only and I didn’t have enough to pay for tax. Frustrated, I was just going to leave but this nice couple asked what’s wrong and I said I wanted to purchase this but I couldn’t. And they said oh, we can pay for it if you want. 

I immediately said no, no, don’t and they said nope we insist and pulled me to the register with them and bought what I wanted alongside their own stuff. They told me they’ve got me covered and I could leave but I wanted to thank them properly. I paid them the money I was going to use for it, despite their request not to and thanked them profusely and they told me not to worry about it. 

After I left, I took this as a sign of fate that I can’t give up yet and there is genuine good in this world. I wish I could tell that couple how much their sacrifice meant to me right now and how they inspired me to continue living and saved me. 

It’s still hard, it’s still frustrating and difficult but there is good in this world. To anyone who loathes themselves like I do, suffers from depression or believes they’re not worth it. You are. These people didn’t know me and they thought I was worth it, they simply looked at me and decided to be kind to me. You deserve kindness to.

1jwy9xb,Please read below for context. Would love input.,"Hi all, I’ve been battling with depression for as long as I can remember. I (26m) am a veteran, in school, and currently getting ready to start my job the end of summer. My life outside of my head is fantastic. I have a wonder and amazing girlfriend, 2 cats, 2 dogs and getting ready to move in with my significant other. I’m about to graduate college, and I have an overall wonderful life. Inside my head, my life isn’t so wonderful, I struggle with memories of severe abuse from my childhood, prior substance abuse (alcohol), failed relationships (friendships included), and a constant feeling of guilt, sadness, overthinking snd fear. I’m currently in therapy through the VA in CBT along with suicidal prevention therapy due to almost taking my own life march 5th of this year. With all these things in motion, the way my life is going, and the amount of great things and hobbies I have in my life, I am scared that the end may not be to far away. I’m exhausted, every single day is a battle in my mind, medication (adderall) does not work for me, I have a really hard time trying to sleep, my mind races all day about everything. I’m tired, and I’m exhausted from trying to keep myself happy because I know my significant other deserves it. She’s truly one of a kind, we were tailor made for one another. I don’t want to give up because I know it would crush her, but I’ve said before to my mom. The pain and exhaustion I feel now, outweighs your pain and exhaustion when I’m gone. I don’t want to reach the end of the line, but my mind is too loud and the commotion is exhausting. I hope soon I’ll be able to figure this out, because one way or another my mind will be quiet.

1jwxnuq,I’m so close to ending my life. I can almost sense it coming,"I feel like I’ve lost my fight to live. I thought quitting weed would help me with my motivation, as it always has done in the past, but this time I have just fallen into a deep depression. At times it’s alright. I’ll have a day where I cook my own meals, clean and get some yard work done, but at the end of the day when I’m done with everything, I get super depressed. I just have no drive anymore. I’m so angry at the world. Every time I see a couple out in public I just get mad. I’m so lonely to the point where I’m just done trying to even look for a girlfriend. No one wants me. I understand women want someone who’s secure and has a good job, but I’ve screwed my life up so much, the best job I could possibly get at this point would be McDonald’s. I feel as if society was built for everyone but me. I feel like I’m the odd one out and no one even pays attention to me anymore. All the people I used to be friends with have moved on. I have a friend group, but it’s hard being friends with them because they are all in love. I’m the only one who isn’t and I just get tired of hearing them talk about their significant others. I’m so done with life. I’m 22 and I doubt there’s even anyone left. It seems like everyone is dating, and all the girls that get on the dating apps don’t even respond to me. I’m just so fed up with being single. Even some of my friends didn’t have jobs or anything, and they still found a girlfriend. How is that possible? When I did have a girlfriend, I treated her the best I could. Now I’m wishing I never broke up with her, because I didn’t think it would be so hard to find someone else. I’m at such a low, I’ve given up trying. I don’t even look for jobs anymore, because when I did have one, it didn’t help me at all. I’ve screwed up every opportunity with a girl because I self sabotage. I feel as if I have to hold them so close because they’ll slip away if I don’t. I overthink so much, but they don’t see it. It gets to the point where I just ghost them because I can’t handle it. I just feel so stale now. I feel like I’m living life in autopilot. My memory isn’t what it used to be. I can only seem to remember negative things. I love my parents to death, but sometimes when I argue with them, I forget all that they’ve done for me. It’s like I can only see what hasn’t been done. I’m just so fed up with life being the way it is, but I’m so stubborn to change. It’s such a war within. I want to change, but at the same time I just feel like it should be easy to find a girlfriend, since everyone else makes it look easy. I’ve caught myself trash talking people more and more, which is something I used to never do. I am just so fed up with the world that I find flaws in other people now. It makes me feel good, since I can’t have what they have and I never will. This kind of depression feels unfixable. I’m so miserable I just can’t take it anymore. I want to end my life but I stop myself every time I think about it. Why can’t I just be a man and do it?

I'm a 20 years old male, diagnosed with autism, ADHD, GAD, and depression. 

I have been suffering with suicidal thoughts since I was 14, however they are just passive thoughts; I'm not going to go through with what my mind is telling me to do, however the fight is becoming increasingly more difficult to deal with because I'm in constant mental pain which translates into physical pain and fatigue. I don't find enjoyment in the things I used to (math, science, writing, cartoons, and art), and I don't enjoy being around people. It's even a constant battle to get up in the morning. I feel dead inside; emotionless. I'm living for others and not myself. I still engage in my hobbies, but trying to do so feels like an insurmountable task. I also tried meeting new people and engaging in new activities, which didn't work out either; It just drained me further.

I've been in therapy for years now, but my life is still shit. I have so much, yet I'm not happy. Someone else deserves my life, ignoring the negative aspects of it. In the case that I do outlive my loved ones, I will end my life when they're gone, as I have no obligations then. I don't think I will be having any more obligations to fulfill because I'm not good at making friends, I am not social, and my mental state will rub off on others.",gamer123XD,2,1,Content Warning: Suicidal Thoughts / Self Harm,struggling life hi im year old male diagnosed autism adhd gad depression suffering suicidal thought since however passive thought im going go mind telling however fight becoming increasingly difficult deal im constant mental pain translates physical pain fatigue dont find enjoyment thing used math science writing cartoon art dont enjoy around people even constant battle get morning feel dead inside emotionless im living others still engage hobby trying feel like insurmountable task also tried meeting new people engaging new activity didnt work either drained ive therapy year life still shit much yet im happy someone else deserves life ignoring negative aspect case outlive loved one end life theyre gone obligation dont think obligation fulfill im good making friend social mental state rub others,0.12647907647907647,0.4635848278705421

It's not that my mom is abusive or anything but we would get into fights often when I lived there, I couldnt handle it anymore so I decided to stay with my dad, he wasn't mad about it at all, would tell me I'm always welcome, but I couldn't help but think I was a burden to them, to both of my parents, I know they love me but I couldn't help but think that they're wasting their time on me.

Getting off track, I was depressed when I lived with my mom and contemplated ending it all, even now when I get calls from her I would feel guilty for not seeing her, so I would cut my legs so I would feel the same pain she is, I don't want to be like this, I hate it but it's the only thing that makes me feel better when she asks me when I'm coming home and that she misses me. I've thought about cutting contact or running away, but I've already hurt my mom enough and now she has my grandma (her mom) involved in it, I'm scared to go over there since everything happened, I have a feeling that I'm gonna get questioned and judged.

1jwu63q,hallucinations but not,"TW for suicidal thoughts And hitler!  
hello. This is a burner account for what soon will become obvious if you continue reading.

 A couple years ago, I was at an all time low with my mental health. And I began to.. well, i don’t know what happened. And that’s kind of what I’m asking. I have never told anybody this out of fear. So here we go.

i had suicidal thoughts mostly, felt worthless, like there was no point to life. Then… things began happening. every time I would walk into my bedroom, every time I’d look at my curtain pole… I’d see myself hanging from it, just dead. Every time. I knew it was real. I couldn’t see it physically, but I imagined it. Then this kind of outreached… every time there was an empty corner in my room I’d imagine myself dead in it. Bullet through the head. Blood on the walls. It was…odd. But I never told anybody.

then, it became weird. Real weird. I began having conversations with these ‘imagination’ hallucination things. i didnt have to speak out loud to talk to them, but I would talk to them in my mind. I didn’t decide what they said. They wouldn’t go away when I asked. And once again, I imagined seeing them, walking about, sitting down, doing actions, etc. but I couldn’t physically see them, I knew they were real. But… they were actual people. And not good ones.

my first imaginary hallucination thing was Hitler. This is why this is a burner. He mortified me. I’d speak to him, and hed try to convince me that I was like him, and I’d be shouting, screaming, sobbing, all in my mind, trying to tell him I wasn’t. I do not believe his views, or agree with his actions in anyway.   
  
then there was Loki, yes, Loki from marvel… and he was calm. Hed comfort me, and hold me and smile, and be soft. this happened for about 6 months, about weekly. 

and then smede, blue goblin, little thing, who I made up. Also talked to me, comforted me. That’s about it.

what was I experiencing? i really want to know, and very rarely it still happens when im really really low. I couldn’t physically see them, but I imagined they were there, could describe them, etc, but i couldn’t chose when they left or stopped talking to me!! I had no control of them,",Burnerrrrrrrrrrrr467,1,2,Content Warning: Suicidal Thoughts / Self Harm,hallucination tw suicidal thought hitler hello burner account soon become obvious continue reading couple year ago time low mental health began well dont know happened thats kind im asking never told anybody fear go suicidal thought mostly felt worthless like point life thing began happening every time would walk bedroom every time id look curtain pole id see hanging dead every time knew real couldnt see physically imagined kind outreached every time empty corner room id imagine dead bullet head blood wall wasodd never told anybody became weird real weird began conversation imagination hallucination thing didnt speak loud talk would talk mind didnt decide said wouldnt go away asked imagined seeing walking sitting action etc couldnt physically see knew real actual people good one first imaginary hallucination thing hitler burner mortified id speak hed try convince like id shouting screaming sobbing mind trying tell wasnt believe view agree action anyway loki yes loki marvel calm hed comfort hold smile soft happened month weekly smede blue goblin little thing made also talked comforted thats experiencing really want know rarely still happens im really really low couldnt physically see imagined could describe etc couldnt chose left stopped talking control,0.04879032258064516,0.43586789554531485

1jwoh84,"Feeling disconnected from life, not being able to enjoy the present","Hi all,

I’m 27F, and for as long as I can remember, I’ve lived mostly in my head, constantly focused on the future, dreaming of what’s next, what could be better, what might be missing. My partner tells me that I am a dreamer and ambitious and as a result, I tend to focus a lot on what more and different I want. However, I think this is an overly positive analysis of the situation. I am a bit of a dreamer and my head is often in the clouds, yes. But the reality is that this just makes me miserable. I do not live the present and enjoy the beauty of my current life.

My life is objectively good. I live in a beautiful green area of a big european city. I’m finally in a healthy, loving relationship after years and years of being single and experiencing painful dating experiences. We have a small but cozy apartment, an adorable cat, and I’m close with my family (even though we live in different countries). This is what I wanted for so long.

But I don’t feel it. It is hard to explain but it's like sometimes - while doing random stuff and getting on with my daily life - I get very clear images images of me walking down a street I have never been to, but that it is always the same, chilling in my garden. Having a different social life. I feel like if the life I am living right now is not mine…

I’ve done CBT therapy for a couple of years, and while it helped with anxiety, this persistent sense of disconnection never really came up. I’ve started to wonder if this could be derealization, or maybe a symptom of something else. Or maybe it’s just that I’ve idealized life so much that I can’t accept when it’s just… normal.

I guess I’m posting to ask:Has anyone else felt this way — like you’re not really living the life you’re in? Like your mind is always somewhere else, chasing something that may not even exist?And if so, what has helped you feel more connected, more grounded?",Own-Somewhere3599,3,1,Question,feeling disconnected life able enjoy present hi im f long remember ive lived mostly head constantly focused future dreaming whats next could better might missing partner tell dreamer ambitious result tend focus lot different want however think overly positive analysis situation bit dreamer head often cloud yes reality make miserable live present enjoy beauty current life life objectively good live beautiful green area big european city im finally healthy loving relationship year year single experiencing painful dating experience small cozy apartment adorable cat im close family even though live different country wanted long dont feel hard explain like sometimes random stuff getting daily life get clear image image walking street never always chilling garden different social life feel like life living right mine ive done cbt therapy couple year helped anxiety persistent sense disconnection never really came ive started wonder could derealization maybe symptom something else maybe ive idealized life much cant accept normal guess im posting askhas anyone else felt way like youre really living life youre like mind always somewhere else chasing something may even existand helped feel connected grounded,0.06939817428947861,0.45261857707509867

• I don't really go in person to school even though I should but I have disability at school so I have a good excuse if I don't show up to class besides all my classes aren't graded on participation/ attendance.
• I have ADHD (I take adderall for it), I have depression/anxiety (I'm on new meds for it but it doesn't help). My depression is more so not wanting to do anything but my adderall combats that to an extent. Since my depression is tied to whether I’m productive or not
• I can do my school work just fine it's just everything else like I don't want to do anything, don't want to clean unless I have to, I don't want to go outside, etc.

• I want to take my dog out on walk but I live in sketch area and it rains all the time and I'm lazy

1jx1u68,"How to become strong, confident and less sensitive?","

I'm a female, 5ft tall, I am quiet and lead a team of 10. I never fit in, people often chat amongst themselves, they also walk off when I'm talking with them (including casual conversations) one does this quite often but listens in to my conversations with others.

When I'm ignored or spoken over, I feel like crying.

I am often criticized but lately more so and I feel worthless.

Any mistake I make at work is shared amongst everyone. I had a team member tell me that the manager was angry at me because I threw 50 sheets of paper out instead of recycling it. (It was full of staples and sticky labels). She is the one who went to the manager, what is worse is I covered her so she could speak to the manager about ""something"".

I am often compared to this person who joined us in February, she was offered my position first but moved country last year. She is a ""natural leader"" so the manager says, she is very loud, very sure of herself and ideas, and people swarm around her. It is as if people want her approval, if we are in the same room people walk straight past me, ""Hi"" is all they say, they go straight to her and show her pictures on their phones.

1jwwk63,Everything is becoming a trigger. What is happening to me?,"
I’m in a state of constant emotional pain, and I don’t know how to describe it. But I am having a weird problem- almost everything around me is turning into a trigger like ""trauma"" (? Loosely defining)

It’s not just memories — it’s everyday places, sounds, even foods. And it’s not just mild discomfort — it’s a flood of unbearable emotional pain, anxiety, and sometimes even physical symptoms like dizziness or feverishness. These “triggers” aren’t just reminders. They feel like the original pain is happening all over again.

Some examples:

- I listened to a specific piece of music once during a painful moment. Now I can’t listen to that song — not even a second — without feeling overwhelmed, almost like I’m being attacked from the inside.

- I walk down a certain road regularly and I did walk down that road when I was deeply hurting. That road now feels unbearable to even think about. Going near it makes my chest tighten and my head spin.

- My dorm room — I spent a couple months there while I was in pain every single day. Now the whole dorm, even the idea of returning, feels suffocating. I get feverish.

- the foods I eat has become such objects too, and now I can’t eat anymore. And any foods that hurt me somehow. But it’s spreading — even foods I’ve tried afterward are becoming linked to that pain. I’m losing weight because eating is getting harder and harder.

- I’m around people, and even they start to feel like triggers — not because they’re bad people, but they were the There are things I don’t like about people. I am very sensitive to people's behaviour anyway. If I notice lies, greed or hostility I feel so weird, almost dread, it hurts. (I am not saying I don’t have those) I can't meet them anymore.

- Anything that hurts me (usually I get hurt really intensely) can become Such trigger. And almost always I am having depression, Mental agony and anxiety.

I don't know if  these make sense? 

It’s like everything is infected with emotional weight. There are hundreds of these triggers, and I feel like I’m getting emotionally traumatized again and again, every single day. And the more I try to push through, the worse it gets. Exposure doesn’t help — it intensifies things. It’s like the pain is feeding itself. The trigger gets stronger every time I try to ignore it and focus on something else.

And this is happening on top of a baseline of constant mental pain, depression, and anxiety. I barely get a break. There’s always something hurting me, always something heavy. I’m exhausted. Everything feels unsafe and painful, even just trying to live a simple day.

What is happening to me?  Is this trauma-related? Or something else? I am diagnosed Persistent Depression, Gad anxiety, BPD. A reason why I am always suffering from Mental agony. I’ve read about trauma, depression, BPD — but nothing seems to explain this continuous, growing, multi-directional pain that’s eating away at my life.

Here’s the backstory: I grew up gay in a Muslim family and lived in a Muslim country for about 19 years. I went through a lot — threats, mockery, constant pressure — just because of who I am, how I look, and the fact that I didn’t fit in.

Now I’m 23 and living happily in Europe, in a non-homophobic country.
But still… I notice people staring at me. Sometimes it feels like they’re staring for way too long — and even with a hint of threat in their eyes (probably just the way my brain reads it).
It’s not like I look super alternative or anything. I’ve just got blond hair and ear piercings.
But I can’t stop fixating on these looks when I walk down the street. I still feel that old sense of danger creeping in.

So yeah… I desperately need advice on how to stop giving a fuck.

1jwj9np,I don’t know what’s wrong with me — I feel stuck and exhausted,"Since childhood, I’ve been introverted and socially awkward. I grew up in an overcritical environment. My father was emotionally and physically abusive to my mother. I even saw him hit her once in front of me. After that, my mom was diagnosed with cancer. I was still a kid and sent to live with my grandparents while she recovered.

I felt so alone during that time. My mom wasn’t around, and that’s when I started creating a new reality in my head — a place just for me. I made imaginary friends to cope. As a result, my studies suffered. No one was there to help me with school. I started believing I was dumb, ugly, and not good enough.

My siblings would call me dumb, and I believed them. I still think they believe I’m useless — and to be honest, I haven’t given them a solid reason to think otherwise. But in high school, I somehow fought through and scored really well. Instead of celebrating, people around me acted shocked — like they thought I wouldn’t even pass. That hurt.

College was a relief. New people, no one knew me, and I made some good friends. But I still carried low self-esteem and remained addicted to my imaginary world. My grades tanked due to procrastination, and I had to take a year off. Eventually, I got into a good degree college, studied properly, and did well. That gave me a bit of confidence. I started questioning the old beliefs — maybe I wasn’t so dumb or ugly after all.

Then my brother suggested I go for an MBA. I don’t know why I didn’t say no. I had no work experience and wasn't even passionate about it. That turned out to be a huge mistake. The college was bad, the faculty worse, and I felt completely out of place. I couldn’t keep up. The old procrastination loop returned. I escaped into my imagination again and avoided reality. I passed, but not with good marks.

It’s been a year since I graduated. I still haven’t applied for jobs. I don’t even know why I’m avoiding it. I tell myself I want my job application to be perfect and have developed anxiety issues and frequent thoughts of like if i don't do this properly or keep the things in particular way some things bad will happen.Now, my family is pressuring me to get married. My mental health is crumbling. I have anxiety, obsessive thoughts.

I used to not care what people thought. Now, every comment cuts deep, and I replay them in my head for hours. I don’t know if I have ADHD, anxiety, OCD, or if I’m just making excuses. But I feel stuck and exhausted. I want to do better, be better — but I don’t know how to start.

I won’t give an entire life story, I’m actually rewriting this because I feel like I overshared wayyyy too much my first go-around lol. 

My dental health was never really treated as a priority until it got way worse than it should’ve been. Mixed with parents never really caring about theirs either didn’t help. This caused me to need crowns on six of my teeth and lose two of my molars. I lost one of my CROWNED TEETH, like fully broken at the gum. It absolutely ravaged my self esteem, I mean it’s my front tooth!! I feel like my other teeth are shifting and one kind of even feels weird, I don’t know how to explain it. 

I‘m so ashamed to leave the house and I feel so hideous, so I can’t even look for a job until I get my flipper tooth back to start saving to get the implant to stop them from shifting!! It’ll only be a little over a week until I get the flipper, but even though I’ve been waiting like 6-7 months at this point, it’s going to be a looooooonnnnggg week. It changes the way I talk, its harder to say certain words so singing along to songs isn’t even that enjoyable anymore. I know it’s only a matter of time until I’m able to get out of this rut and start improving my life and my teeth for the better, it just really sucks that I’m 20 and missing 3 of my teeth already and have crowns on 5 others. At this rate I’ll need dentures by 30. 

I must say though, through everything, my lovely boyfriend stuck with me. He’s been there no matter what and assured me that he would love me even if i had no teeth haha. He always calls me beautiful and gorgeous. It isn’t like I don’t have a support system, but I try not to put too much strain on him about it though. I don’t always want to seem upset over it although i definitely am always thinking about it at least. He is my boyfriend and hopefully life partner. Many things, but not my therapist.  Like it’s hard for me to kiss, and it‘s hard for me to say “v’s” anymore, so even saying “I love you” is a little hard and it breaks my heart and comes out all airy sounding but I do try.

1jx3a0b,My family dismisses my pain after a traumatic experience and I wish they would support me,"TW potential SA

My brother’s friend was inappropriate and nobody supports me. 

(Throwaway account) This happened two years ago, when I was fifteen.

My older brother was having a house party, because our parents weren’t home. It was a secret, I had promised him to keep. My brother said I could just stay in my room throughout the whole night and I agreed.

People started showing up at around 7 pm that also included N (25M). I had never met him before, but when I came down to steal some chips, we started chatting about life and actually got along well. He convinced me to go into the living room and say properly hi to the rest. I did that and I started drinking with them.

People started to leave around midnight and I think I went up to my room or something? 

I woke up the next morning and noticed some blood on my bed, my stomach hurt and I had some bruises on my knee and thighs. I changed underwear and went downstairs. I saw N and he quickly ran away, when he saw me and said that he had to go home. I asked my brother why he was at our house and he replied that N had stayed the night. I didn’t tell anyone about this and went on with my life.

I randomly met N the next month at a carnival. He started to chat to me and I tried to end the conversation, but he didn’t listen (my friends had left me alone). He started asking me weird questions like “how many guys have you kissed”, “do you like older guys” etc. he also confessed being attracted to girls under 18, but he threatened me not to say it to anyone else. He also touched me (you know where) and forced me to drink alcohol with him. Suddenly he said “let’s go to my apartment” and grabbed me. 
My friends came back around this time and we left for a short bit.

When we returned, he had stolen our things (jackets, bags etc). I got very irritated and my friends told me that it was okay, as long as I was alright. N texted me and said that I had to come to his apartment alone to get our things back. I went with my friends to the apartment and after a very weird conversation, we got our things back. I promised N not to say this to anyone as long as he left me alone. He agreed and did so.

My brother never stopped being friends with this man. I tried telling him what happened at the carnival and he thought I was overreacting (I didn’t wanna tell him about the first experience, when I myself don’t even know what happened). 
They are still friends and hang out. N doesn’t come to our house anymore, which was a decision my brother made for me.
He says that it’s more than enough and I’m overreacting for wanting to destroy a good friendship. 

Our parents also know (only about the carnival experience) and they told me to support my brother no matter what and that he was nice for not bringing N around because of me. Basically said I was the problem. 

After the carnival, I started to SH (won’t be specific but it is what you imagine probably)

I also started having nightmares about N assaulting me, which I find weird because I don’t remember anything from that night. I dissociate a lot and Idk why. I also just don’t feel safe like anywhere. 

I have told my mom this and she has told me that I’m overreacting and it’s not that serious as I make it out to be. 

I really want my family to understand where I’m coming from and support me. It feels like they’ve taken N’s side

Tl;dr: My brother’s friend treated me badly two years ago and I’ve never gotten any support from my family

1jx2zru,I’m so sick of people saying they know me better than I do.,"I just feel like nobody believes me. Everyone sees me as a liar. I hate lying, I’ve always wanted people to be honest, but I guess I’m the biggest liar there is.

I’ve said many times already that I tried EVERYTHING to be a good person. I do everything my friends, my therapist, the internet say good people do, but it’s never enough. No matter how much I try to be helpful, nice or at least neutral, it’s not enough to make up for what I’ve done when I was younger. Either that or I go even lower and say something that upsets the other person.

I call myself evil or a bad person to, without explaining too much, show people what I am like. I’m not using it because I don’t know the meaning, I’m not using it to be edgy, I’m not using it to feel special. I just know I hurt people, I can’t stop hurting people and the last thing I’ll do in my life will probably be to hurt people. Especially the only person I love. He said the only thing I could do to hurt him was to disappear. The more I hear I’m not right about myself, the more I don’t see the reason to stay here. It’s all too much.

I can’t find any support anywhere. People either told me I don’t want to work on myself or that I’m lying. I am doing my best to be good, I am doing my best to not hurt people, but it doesn’t work. I still hurt people. People still don’t want me close to themselves and they tell me I’m a terrible person.

Whenever there is a list of things people tell to do to be a good person I do everything already and those aren’t good things to me, they are the bare minimum. They can’t make up for everything I’ve done. 

And what have I done? I’ve made a list because everyone is so sure to assume it’s not bad, and I’m sick of saying it every damn time.

Is it a lot that I want people to believe me? To see who I am? Some don’t want to leave me alone even when I tell them I’m a bad person. What if they get hurt? Is it fault?

1jx2bd7,My mom is pressuring me to lie to my psychiatrist — should I tell the truth anyway?,"I’m 21F, diagnosed with GAD and social anxiety. I’ve been on Prozac (20 mg) for a month, and while it helps with my focus and sociability when I’m busy with school, I still experience intense emotional pain, emptiness, and obsessive spirals when I’m alone or during breaks. Lately, I’ve also been having mood fluctuations — like one day I feel okay, and the next I feel low, hopeless, and emotionally overwhelmed.
Here’s the problem: my mom doesn’t believe in medication. She keeps saying things like “don’t tell your psychiatrist that the meds aren’t working or they’ll increase the dose,” or “these pills are not a solution, you need to stop them after graduation.” She even tells me to lie during appointments — just smile, say everything’s fine, and act like I’m improving.
The thing is, I’m not okay. I’ve even used the benzos my psych prescribed in ways I probably shouldn’t have (more like emotional coping than actual need). And I’m scared of what happens after graduation when I lose my structure and routine — that’s when I spiral most. But I’m stuck in this weird guilt where I feel like if I tell my psychiatrist the truth, I’m betraying my mom… and if I lie, I’m betraying myself.Has anyone else been in this kind of situation? How do you handle being caught between family pressure and your actual mental health needs? Is it worth being honest if I’m scared they’ll think I’m overreacting or drug-seeking?

This was just a stupid example to give you an idea.
Everything triggers smth like this.

There is a trigger then a thought then anxiety. And everything inducing anxiety relates to getting arrested and prosecuted. Everything in my life triggers a thought that leads to a fear of getting prosecuted, convicted, arrested, jailed and a destroyed reputation.

1jx1nhw,What’s the best treatment for an ex-cocaine user (self-cured) who still has porn usage issues?,"
My boyfriend has been clean of cocaine for a year and a half, he used to be very depressed and did drugs and was addicted to porn and now he is clean of coke but I’m not sure he has overcome the porn issue, even though I know it has drastically been reduced. He has been better about not watching it for a long time since we’re together because we have a very active sexual life but I know he occasionally does it (and so do I, but only when I’m really horny and he is not around, and not very often).

But yesterday things exploded because I went out of town for two days for work and found out he was binge mastuebating to porn (5 times or more in a day). At first he denied it until I presented proof. He claims it’s not an issue and he just wanted to take advantage of the fact he was alone for the first time in a year since we’re always stuck together, but I think his binge while I was gone is a problem and that he may be sick.
Important thing to note is he had suffered mild ED for a year before he decided to see a doctor and get pills. He claims the ED was due to cocaine usage and prostate issues but I’m now afraid the ED was related to porn abuse. This plus his porn use affected me deeply and caused me trauma and self esteem issues. Now he is able to get erections reliably with the pill and we have sex almost every day, and I do genuinely trust his prob usage is very infrequent, but I fear he is not getting stimulation from me in the way he should even though I am an attractive and fit person and he loves my body, and I fear every time I leave he will take that chance to binge watch porn and mastuebate in an excessive way and I don’t know what to do about it.

1jwy2v7,Advice for help with family member in home experiencing psychosis,"My (40F) cousin (40M) recently moved in with us (me, husband (38M) and child (18M)) in our home state after being away for \~15 years. Cousin ""Carl"" is mentally unwell, but doesn't believe he is and has been unwilling to get help when we've tried to have individual convos with him. My husband, one of Carl's brothers, their dad, the brother's wife, and me are going to approach Carl in 2 days together to try to convince him to get help and I'm hoping this subreddit can give some tips and guidance for us and him.

I had to pare this down significantly to fit char limit, so a lot is missing.

Carl has delusions and believes there's a video recording of him during a drunken rant 7-8 years ago where he claimed he did awful things and made predictions. He doesn't remember what he said, but remembers it when the prediction comes true. The rant did happen IRL. But there is no video, and he's not clairvoiant. He ~~believes~~ knows that *everyone* is in on it and that we - family, friends, medical profs, the govt, strangers like rando cashiers, etc - are all lying to him about the existence of said video, that we've seen the video, and continue its distribution. Apparently the goal of this conspiracy is to drive him crazy. 

He believes the COVID-19 pandemic was fake and that COVID actually stands for Carl Olson VIDeo. He ~~believes~~ knows the entire world is lying to him. He does not believe people who have died in recent years are really deceased or that his mother actually had a stroke (which was the event that forced him and his parents to all move back here to our home state), but these are lies and coverups and are all ""part of the plan"" and just more of his ""prophecies.""

For context, Carl has 3 brothers and one has schizophrenia.

Multiple family members have tried to logic with Carl and explain why his (we don't use the word) delusions aren't true or even possible, but every conversation where ""the video"" or ""the plan"" or ""why you guys are lying to me \[him\]"" ends in him getting angry and leaving the room. Luckily there hasn't been any violence yet. I've since learned you can't logic a person out of their delusions and it's best to just ""go along with it"" in a sense and redirect.

Carl watches YouTube a LOT and many of the videos he watches are astrological/horoscope-type where Carl draws connections with their statements and talks to the people in the YouTube vids. Not just those ones...he talks to his videos all day long, and believes they hear him and are communicating with him. One day he was yelling about killing one of his brothers and gave aggressive violent detail I won't share here, but it scared me. I informed the brother, who lives 20 mins from us and is where their parents live, and reached out for help on Headspace. 

Headspace put me in touch with my county's mental health and we began the path to have Carl involuntarily committed.

1jwxmzq,I just want basic respect.,"I'm writing this during class (dw, the teacher allows it and I did all of my work) so I might not respond immediately.

But I'm just feeling really insecure lately because of how many failed relationships as well as how many people hate ad try to have beef with me.

People hate me due to the fact that I wasn't the best person during middle school. I didn't BULLY people, but I had insulted people in the past due to having trouble with my emotions and I was in a fuck ton of drama. People are still on to that and haven't moved on since then.

Due to this, people in my school hate me. My mental health has absolutely tarnished due to all of this shit I have to deal with currently. I also have abusive parents. I'm clearly developing a mental disorder and it has devastated me. 

Truth is, I changed. I'm not like that anymore.

I know I cannot force people to like me or have basic respect of me, but I just want to move away from all of this bullshit. I just can't wait before I can finally have my life in place. I feel trapped every single day of this stupid fucking life. 

I've dealt with discrimination as well. I'm a Bisexual black girl who is possibly disabled. I hate everything about my life.

And before people say, ""just don't care about what they think!"" I CAN'T. I've legitimately tried and it didn't work out.

1jwo7l6,Why do I crave romantic love when I know I’m not worth it?,"
I know this sounds like a self esteem issue but I really just think I see things objectively. 

I know there are countless women out there prettier than me (I don’t believe beauty is completely subjective), no matter how hard I try to work on myself. 

I have reasonable intelligence, but I’m nothing special. I don’t have any outstanding talents. I try to be a nice person, but a lot of people are nice. 

Also, I don’t WANT to compete with other women. I’m no more deserving of love than anyone else. 

I also have very bad mental health conditions (which I have sought treatment for many, many times - but they never really go away). 

I think I could probably could have a relationship if I wanted, but it’d probably just be lukewarm. 

Because I know I’m not anyone’s dream girl. They would be settling for me. And I would know what they *really* want is not me… they just can’t do better. They wouldn’t really LOVE me. 

And I can’t blame them for that - because honestly, I would be the same. I wouldn’t be able to be with anyone I genuinely wanted to be with because my standards are too high and there’s no way they’d want me. So I’d just be with someone like myself and maybe we’d grow to resent each other. 

Honestly, I’m just too greedy. I desperately want to BE loved. I don’t know how good I am at giving love back. And I suspect that a lot of people are like this. Thinking about what they can GET from a relationship, not what they can give, and sometimes thinking how to manipulate the other person into wanting them by being fake. 

I can ACT lovingly - I spend a lot of time helping people and I can sound caring and compassionate- but inside I often just feel irritated.

To keep a partner I feel I would always just have to be catering to their desires to keep them around. I can’t imagine anyone actually caring about my own feelings. Why should they? 
Maybe there are loving people out there and I’m just assuming all people suck because I suck but it’s think unfortunately a lot of people are like me. 
I just can’t see any good reason for anyone falling in love with me. I would not fall in love with myself. 

Why are we designed to want what we can’t have? I know I’m nothing special, and the truth hurts. I so badly crave love that I just… don’t deserve. And so I just don’t see the point. 

I know I’m not entitled to anything. I know I’m just another human and I am not the “main character”. The world owes me nothing. I am not important. I’m well aware of this! But I can’t help thinking “what’s the point, then?” If I’m not going to be loved deeply… I’d rather just not exist. 

I sound selfish, I know, and I hate myself, but I guess at least I’m being honest. :(

1jwlayf,I'm really struggling right now,"I don’t usually post like this, but I feel like I have nowhere else to turn. My mental health is at an all-time low, and I don’t know how much more I can take. I’m withdrawing from my medication—not because I want to, but because there's a national shortage and I haven't had it in days. And it’s hitting me hard. I feel like I'm spiraling.

On top of that, I’m financially struggling. I can’t seem to find stability, and I know a big part of it is how I yo-yo between crashing and chasing those little highs just to feel something. Endorphin-seeking, impulsive decisions—anything to break the numbness. But it always leaves me worse off, and more ashamed.

I feel like I’ve got nobody. No family to turn to, and my friends... I know they’re tired of hearing about it. Honestly, I’m tired of hearing myself talk about it too. I try so hard to keep going, to use the “coping techniques” they tell me to try, to do all the things you’re supposed to do—but nothing helps. I feel like I’m screaming into a void, asking for help, and nothing ever changes.

I’m so tired of hearing “it gets better.” It hasn't. Not for me. And when I think it might—when I think there’s a light ahead—it always slips away. Past traumas I thought I’d buried are creeping back into my mind, and it feels like I’m drowning in everything I’ve tried to escape.

I don’t know what I’m asking for with this post. Maybe just to not feel so alone. Maybe someone else out there feels the same, and we can be in this awful, raw, painful place together.

(If you wanna know the entire story I have another previous post abt it) 

But to sum it up

I turned 19 last month.. but before that I was flirting with someone a grade below me whom I assumed was around my age (falsely). 

This happened over the span of 13 days of flirting and then I was asked out- to which I said at first.. but obviously cut it off when I was alerted of his age (which turned out to be 16. I was 18 but would turn 19 very soon obviously).
While the age gap was 2 years and a few months- I couldn’t imagine going through with something like that. 

I didn’t break any laws.. but I still feel absolutely dogshit. I never wanna take advantage of anyone, or hurt anyone at all. 

But idk how to move forward. I’ve been in a loop for over a month stewing on this. There isn’t one day I don’t feel anxious and guilty about it.

1jwjhvr,"Growing paranoia and auditory hallucinations, looking for support and advice","I (23F) have been experiencing a growing sense of paranoia when I’m at home. It started a few months ago, and has escalated into auditory hallucinations, nightmares, and a growing sense of being watched. 

I live with my fiancé (26M), and he hasn’t heard the things I have so I know they aren’t real. We have a security system that we activate at night and when we leave, and the motion detectors don’t pick anything up (they’re on all ground level doors, and one is angled at the stairs so we would know if someone came or down the stairs). We also have a panic button in our room in case of an emergency.

Logically, I KNOW that what I’m hearing isn’t real, and that what I’m feeling is unreasonable. I have a pretty easy time differing between the fake things I hear (foot steps, scratching in the wall, breathing/mumbling behind me or in other rooms) but it freaks me out that it is even happening in the first place. It makes my heart race so bad, and I have to take a moment to calm myself and remind myself that I’m safe. 

Just earlier today, I stepped out of our bedroom to grab something from the office, and I heard “footsteps”slowly approaching me from down the hallway. I know it wasn’t my fiancé, as I could still see him in bed from where I was standing. I ran back to our room and just wanted to cry. I’m so sick of this. I’ve also started having nightmares of demons, home invasions, and phrogging. While awake, I just have this general feeling like I’m being watched but only when I’m at home.

I’m tired of this, and while it doesn’t seem to be getting worse, it also doesn’t seem to be getting better. I already have plans to see a psychiatrist about this, but I’m on a waitlist and the time it’s taking until I can talk to someone is frustrating. So I decided to post here for advice and support.

I do not partake in hard drugs of any kind. I last smoked weed almost four years ago, last smoked nicotine almost three years ago, and occasionally drink alcohol. I’ve never done any sort of hallucinogen (besides weed). I truly have no idea what could have triggered these symptoms. My family has a slight history of BPD, but I didn’t think it could cause things like this to happen. I’ve also been tested for it previously and never showed signs of it.

Physically, I am healthy. I’ve been focusing on eating better, drinking enough water, and trying to sort out a workout routine. I get at least seven hours of sleep a night. I take care of myself. In terms of stress, I work full-time while also working to earn my bachelors, so I would say I deal with it occasionally but I was doing so much better. When I was younger, I was diagnosed with clinical depression and anxiety/agoraphobia, but I haven’t had symptoms in several years now. 

I’ve been doing so much better—I’m soooo much happier—and now this has started. It’s so frustrating, I feel like I won one battle with my head and now it’s starting another one.

I and Ja defended him, and K just started being mad at both of us.

He knew when Y exactly went to her home and chatted her. He also knew when Y was chatting to other ppl.

It was now ok, for a while. A few days ago give or take, He trashtalked another classmate, Ja, saying he was bad (in a friends group chat). Ja left and K was kicked. K apologized, Ja kinda forgave.

1jwmd8f,Hey.. I’m a 20yo Male and I’ve never been depressed but I think I might be right now.,"First off, I may just need to type it out and say everything so this may not make much sense but I really feel like I should type everything out.

Just so you know a bit about me, I’m a Christian, I am dating, I currently live on my own with a roommate who is my best friend since preschool. I have a really good job as a designer and I’m also teaching the class I graduated from at my trade school as a second source of income just for the heck of it. I love my girlfriend, my family and friends, and my Miata (which I’m slowly working on getting turbo’d. 

Recently my dad has been struggling health wise and he is has gotten back and hip surgery too. He and my mom live on a small farm but with my mom always going to vendor shows to sell her pyramid scheme stuff, that leaves me and my sister to take care of the farm when my dad can’t. Speaking of my sister, let me start talking about her now. She has always been a pain in my rear but I do love her. Recently she has been getting frustrated with me because I put boundaries on her and I say “no” to her now when she says I need to do something and I in-fact DON’T need to do it for her. Since I moved out 6/2024 she has made comments about how I’ve become a jerk since then and don’t put family first yet whenever my dad needs help with the farm, I make sure she and I have it worked out to take care of each day that he can’t. She also could be talking about my girlfriend. We started dating the same time I moved out. She actually asked me out a while before but I told her to hold off on our first date until I moved out. She is 27 so yes there is an age gap but we don’t notice it. I will also admit that she is my first girlfriend. That being said I plan on preposing this June. She is my safe place who I even was able to tell that I had a porn addiction to. She had been helping me get out of it which has been so freeing. Last night I told her I’ve been feeling very oddly emotional so we were cuddled on her couch and I asked her to hold me. She quickly shifted to hold me and I fell asleep in her arms. Next thing I know I wake up at 4:30 cold and by myself on the couch. I get up walk over to her bedroom and see her laying asleep in bed. Yes, I am Christian but personally I don’t see anything wrong with actually sleeping together. Anyways.. we live in the same apartment complex so I got up, put my shoes on, and walked to my apartment where I got a shower and am now in bed. I feel very sad and lonely right now but there is an overwhelming dark cloud over me and I don’t know what it is.

Also I forgot to add this at but..

Recently my gf and I have started trying to lose weight which is nice because I’ve never worked out before. Neither of us are necessarily in bad shape but I could definitely lose a couple lbs lol.

1jwzxpo,It's so discouraging when a doctor or therapist refuses to see you,"This will probably be long...so I've been trying to get help again after about a year of not seeing any kind of professional and I've encountered one obstacle after another. I had recently tried going back to an outpatient program and that didn't go well but I'd like to stay on the medication they had placed me on. I've made several phone calls, trying to get an appointment with a new prescriber, and left messages but no place is returning my call. I went back to a community mental health clinic today and was told that the nurse practictioner will no longer see me. When I asked why, all they would tell me is that he will no longer see me. She said it in a really cheerful, fake voice. Like it's so common to be refused mental health treatment for no reason.

I was told, however, that I could go back next Tuesday and see the psychiastrist who works there but I still don't trust them. I'm trying to form a back up plan to get my medication in case things don't work out. All that I want is Trileptal. Before that, I was on Lamictal but I find that this is working better. However, I strongly suspect that I'm going to run out before I can get a new prescription and I'm thinking of giving up once again and just facing things with no medication or therapy.

A walk in clinic here in town told me on Wednesday that they would give me a one month supply of Trileptal on a time basis. They were very serious about that and I could tell that they meant it. I could get a 30 day supply but never ask them again. However he said that he first needed to see my bottle of medication and I didn't have it with me. I started to go home and get it and go back that day but I didn't. And today there was a different nurse practitoner working. When I showed him my bottle he made a face and said that he could only give me enough to last me a day or two and I could tell by the way he was talking to me that he really didn't want to deal with me at all. He said that if I run out, then the pharmacy would give me more. I almost started laughing. I told him that there was no way the pharmacy was going to give me more pills. Doesn't matter what kind they are; they just don't do that. I informed him that the other person had said I could have a one month supply, one time only. He said no, that's not how they work.

But it's not just medication. I was once discharged from an outpatient program for not making enough progress. The director even called me into her office and chewed me out. I rememeber her pointing her finger at me and yelling, ""You haven't chaged at all!"" ""You haven't changed at all!"" I'll admit, I had lost all the progess I had made which I'm sure is frustrating from their end. But nobody gave me credit for all the progress I had made there before I started gettting depressed again.

It hurts so bad to be treated this way by mental health professionals. The very people who are supposed to help. I think they're often disrespectful simply because they can get away with it. They're stressed out and they take some of that frustration out on us. Or they associate mental patients with trouble. Or drug seeking behavior. Mostly, I think they just see us as profoundly sick people who they would often rather not have anything to do with. Why they chose this career, I have no idea but it seems obvious to me that they see us in a negative way and this often makes me want to just hide all my symptoms the best I can and have nothing to do with mental health treatment.",WoahVenom,5,1,Venting,discouraging doctor therapist refuse see probably longso ive trying get help year seeing kind professional ive encountered one obstacle another recently tried going back outpatient program didnt go well id like stay medication placed ive made several phone call trying get appointment new prescriber left message place returning call went back community mental health clinic today told nurse practictioner longer see asked would tell longer see said really cheerful fake voice like common refused mental health treatment reason told however could go back next tuesday see psychiastrist work still dont trust im trying form back plan get medication case thing dont work want trileptal lamictal find working better however strongly suspect im going run get new prescription im thinking giving facing thing medication therapy walk clinic town told wednesday would give one month supply trileptal time basis serious could tell meant could get day supply never ask however said first needed see bottle medication didnt started go home get go back day didnt today different nurse practitoner working showed bottle made face said could give enough last day two could tell way talking really didnt want deal said run pharmacy would give almost started laughing told way pharmacy going give pill doesnt matter kind dont informed person said could one month supply one time said thats work medication discharged outpatient program making enough progress director even called office chewed rememeber pointing finger yelling havent chaged havent changed ill admit lost progess made im sure frustrating end nobody gave credit progress made started gettting depressed hurt bad treated way mental health professional people supposed help think theyre often disrespectful simply get away theyre stressed take frustration u associate mental patient trouble drug seeking behavior mostly think see u profoundly sick people would often rather anything chose career idea seems obvious see u negative way often make want hide symptom best nothing mental health treatment,0.023452129266082755,0.4029984227658645
1jwz1th,(20M) Everyone hates me and I am worthless.,"
I have never been evaluated or diagnosed with any mental disorder quite yet. But I am an extremely anxious person. And i have a compulsive fear of rejection/others opinions. I am obsessed with the idea of being a “good” person or having the “right” opinion according to the standards of others. For example, if someone I know, or in some cases a complete stranger says something bad about a band I like, it will take me literal weeks to regain the courage to even listen to them on my own again. If I am disliked in any way, then my life doesn’t matter. Every memory, emotion, dream, and passion I ever had is all invalidated because I’m hated or evil. I’m just an animal that needs to be put down. On top of that, I have a doomscrolling problem. I will doomscroll on Reddit or TikTok for literal hours just looking at all of this negative news. I think my worst doomscrolling session was six hours straight.

With that out of the way, I can move on to today’s mental health issue. With all that’s been happening in the world, I feel like now the entire world hates me. I’ve been doomscrolling through various Canadian and European subreddits just soaking in the anger and hste that they express. I let it get to my heart. I am convinced that every single one of them hates me and wishes the worst for me. Ive seen a lot of anger toward American people, not just the government. I’m starting to believe them, I’m starting to believe I’m just the child of an empire and that i don’t matter. I need to stand down and realize that all these other countries are better and more moral than me. I just feel so worthless and unwanted. My fear of rejection has hit its absolute peak.

I'm writing here because I'm just mentally exhausted. I don't know what's wrong with me, I just know I've felt drained for so long that I can't even remember the last time I truly felt ""okay."" 

I'm tired. Not just a little tired like when you don't sleep well. It's a mental exhaustion that clings to my skin, that drains me the moment I wake up and follows me into sleep. I feel like I'm carrying a huge weight every single day. I'm constantly stressed, even without a clear reason. My body is always tense. My shoulders are tight, my back hurts, and I have these aches that never go away. Sometimes my heart feels like it's being pierced by ice-sharp and sudden. And when I sleep, my dreams always revolve around me being in a coma, or sometimes even dead. 

I haven't had a horrible life. And that's what confuses me the most. I don't have an obvious “excuse”. And yet I feel this way. I'm ashamed of myself, of my failures, of my choices. I feel like I'm constantly disappointing everyone. My parents even say it, directly or indirectly. And when I try to explain how I feel, I'm made to seem ungrateful, like I just want to hurt people. 

I don't want pity. I just want to breathe. I want to pause the world. To stop enduring this invisible but constant pressure. I have no motivation left. I can't pretend anymore. Even simple things like Christmas or my birthday make me feel bad, because I feel guilty for not being able to give anything back, or for having to smile just to make others happy.

1jx4vtn,Life is bleak and cruel,"It feels like life keeps playing mean tricks on me for over 40 years now. And I can't be hopeful for the future anymore. 

I grew up in a toxic home. It took me years to work through the effects of the abuse, I am still in therapy today. 
I had toxic friendships and relationships because I had no idea how to weed these people out. 

A few years ago, it started to turn around. I cut contact with the toxic ones, and I found my person. We created our own little family with our fur child. I proposed to her last summer and she said yes.

Next week she will be moving out. She had a lot of stuff on her plate lately and she completely lost herself. She needs to work on herself (and I agree) but she chose to do that without me. 

I have no relatives apart fom my abusive mother. I have a few friends but they live far away.

The only home I ever knew will walk out the door next Friday. I have no idea how I will overcome this.

1jx4a6f,Life has been a lonely quiet sad room lately,"35M. Lately it's just been hitting me that no matter what I do in life, nothing gets better. In fact, I feel like I take one step ahead and fall two steps back. I used to always think positive and I still do but can't ignore these thoughts that shadow me like clouds. My whole life, I've always wanted to make others smile, give away my last dollar, feed others and help them with anything even if I'm going through my own issues. Now I realize all those people ghost you, don't call or text and if you reach out, it's like you're invading them. I never did things for people in hopes of getting it in return. I always just wanted the love or friendship to be reciprocated, that's all. Now it's like life changed, especially in the last 3-4 years. I'd say for me specifically, I've noticed since 2020, my depression has gotten bad. Meds don't help. Therapy isn't working. I've tried meditating, exercise, distracting myself but yet nothing is working. So I came to the realization that this is just the new normal or maybe I'm the only one feeling this. I try to find someone worth living for but no one exists of that nature. As a single guy who has been single for what feels like a decade, dating is hard, people ghost you, people also flake out on plans. It's hard to find someone in life. I left that predicament on hold for now as it's hard to find someone that you can share life with. 

I just find it weird that the ones with good hearts and good intentions always get it the worst in life. I have never hurt anyone physically, emotionally or verbally. I have always been the one that's there for someone no matter what. I'll go out of my way to make a persons day or situation better. I just wonder how the ones with evil intentions, or bad hearts seems to get everything in life from the cars, houses, soulmates and all. 

I don't know if this is my life from this time forward or if things will change but now I just wished I vanished as no one cares, no one would be affected and there's nothing left for me. I don't know what my purpose is here, I don't know if there's really a after life. I don't know if this is all a simulated life and I'm just some boring character on someone's board game or computer. I don't know anymore. 

There's nights I cry my eyes out literally to the point I fall asleep and waking up with sore eyes. I don't feel the urge to eat, I just wished there was a option to hit a button. Maybe two buttons, one to reset life again and the other to just end it all and you vanish. What button would you hit?  Sorry for my venting and all this nonsense talk but this is my outlet and my only way of venting. Maybe life gets better one day, maybe not. But till the end I'm still the same bubbly smiling caring loving guy that's always here for you till I'm gone. Hope you aren't in the same boat, but if you are, there's plenty of room and I hope we can share and connect.

1jwznix,"28M, how life can be depressing most of the time.","I am not looking for sympathy or any opinions of any kind. Just a random nobody venting. 

It is quite fascinating to be honest. How your seemingly normal life sometimes take a drastic turn for the very worse. To the extent you never have ever expected it to. The 180° some may call it. Or one moment you are completely fine and for reason unknown you feel so down that you start crying for no reason. The moment I think I have ""understood"" what life is or have a general idea about it, the very next moment something unexpected happens which I would not see coming. Like how ? I mean how is it possible, when you are prepared for everything like everything.

You make countless scenarios in your head. You talk to yourself about it. You talk with people around you about it. You correct your every seemingly wrong/bad thing about you. You work on yourself. You try to gain the confidence you never had. You try to be as calm as possible in every and any situation. You are polite and humane with everyone around you. You absolutely give your very best you can every single day. Yet, that moment comes and every thing you have worked on seems like a total waste. Like why ? What is the point in working on yourself ? Trying to be a better version of yourself ? Trying to be More than what you can be ? Trying to be what you imagine to be ? When all it takes is a moment to destroy it all. 

It is more astonishing when the next morning (if you get any sleep after all that) everything is the same. When one moment your whole life seemed to meant nothing, the next morning it is the same. The moment has passed and the aftermath is and always will be, the same. Nothing has changed, nothing has vanished, nothing was lost and nothing gained. You would think it would be hard to get up but it is the easiest thing to do at that moment. You are wide awake, the crushing moment which destroyed you and shattered you is now just a part of your history. It is not ancient now but it would be someday, nevertheless a history. The morning is same, the clouds are same (or maybe the aren't), the air you are breathing is the same, the beating heart in your chest is the same and the people around you are the same. Only You, you are not the same. 

This is the part I struggle with the most. How can you explain someone how are you not the same when everything about you seems same to any preset eyes. How can you make them understand, the time which flew normally for them was like an eternity for me. How can I make them understand, how ""not fine"" I am when every part of my body seems ""fine"" to them ? How can I make them understand when I myself don't understand why that moment came and shattered my entire existence. How can I make them understand how crushed and helpless I am after that moment. When the only thing I know is to smile and nothing more. I can't cry, scream or show any kind of emotion. At that moment I am trying to pick up my shattered existence and trying to seem 'Normal', as that is the only thing I know. Sometimes I even forget how to be 'Normal'. Among the multiple faces this clown has to wear, I often forget which is my real face. 

This is the constant of my life, which has kept me depressed most of life.",ClownAz,5,2,Venting,life depressing time looking sympathy opinion kind random nobody venting quite fascinating honest seemingly normal life sometimes take drastic turn worse extent never ever expected may call one moment completely fine reason unknown feel start cry reason moment think understood life general idea next moment something unexpected happens would see coming like mean possible prepared everything like everything make countless scenario head talk talk people around correct every seemingly wrongbad thing work try gain confidence never try calm possible every situation polite humane everyone around absolutely give best every single day yet moment come every thing worked seems like total waste like point working trying better version trying trying imagine take moment destroy astonishing next morning get sleep everything one moment whole life seemed meant nothing next morning moment passed aftermath always nothing changed nothing vanished nothing lost nothing gained would think would hard get easiest thing moment wide awake crushing moment destroyed shattered part history ancient would someday nevertheless history morning cloud maybe arent air breathing beating heart chest people around part struggle explain someone everything seems preset eye make understand time flew normally like eternity make understand fine every part body seems fine make understand dont understand moment came shattered entire existence make understand crushed helpless moment thing know smile nothing cant cry scream show kind emotion moment trying pick shattered existence trying seem normal thing know sometimes even forget normal among multiple face clown wear often forget real face constant life kept depressed life,0.1164637445887446,0.5329951298701298

1jwja3g,Life feels monotone and I think its starting to get to me.,"I usually never minded it as much but recently I've just felt tired all the time. I'm not getting work done like I've used to. Always putting it off til late at night and then I do basically nothing for the whole day. And its the same shit every week too.
Just getting up and going to class, sitting down in my room. 

I'm always glad I left high school but everything after has never exactly felt exciting. Am I supposed to be enjoying life? I'm not, or atleast I think I don't. More like putting up with it. You're supposed to be glad to go to college but I'm sure not. You're supppsed to have friends but I sure don't. Everyone I knew I left back in high school, and even then I never did anything with them. 

I was a fucking idiot then and still am. I had friends but I never did shit. They'd ask me for my socials and what did I do? I blew them off. Can't have people thinking I needed ""friends"". Oh no, I was ""too good"". Same shit here and now. Brief conversations with classmates that ends once the lecture is over. Every now and then me and a girl converse when we spot each other on campus. But its like a fucking random encounter in a video game. 

None of it is constant. No one talks to me outside of class for the most part. No one messages me. My only hint of sociality is my fucking family. And I hate it. I know what my problem is, I'm not even fucking trying to get out there. Yet nothing changes. I'm still sitting on my ass in my room all the time. I used to not care about it. After all, the only person that really matters is myself right? But now I feel so tired and lazy. I hate being lazy. But I don't ever wanna do my work. I just put up with it. For today, and the next, and the rest of the week. And the next week. The month. The year. Fuck this shit.

Sometimes I wish I was born an idiot so that I wouldn't have to think so much. Then maybe I'd have some joy in myself. I can't ever like anything. Or be excited for anything. Not my birthday in a few weeks, or finishing this semester. I don't like how my body is either, I'm skinny, and have a belly which I don't like. Not that it matters anyways, no one ever sees it.

It just all feels monotone. Thats the way I can describe it. Its not hell. That would probably be more exciting. Its just boring. I wish I had actual friends, but I'd prolly just keep them at arms length too. Forgot about a girlfriend, no one's ever interested in me. And I'm not really even asking for help here either. Its funny in a way. I'm just screaming out somewhere, maybe hoping someone answers, but I'm not gonna even answer back. It's not like anyone fucking cares.

My chest feels heavy like something is crushing me, and I can’t breathe properly. I’m just laying here, crying quietly, thinking about how I’ve made it to 27 and still feel so unwanted, so unloved, so broken.

Why did I have to be born like this? With autism, with a face people mock, with feelings I can’t express and pain I can’t describe. Why did I get bullied as a kid… and why are adults still laughing at me now? It’s like I never really escaped it.

I feel ugly. I feel weird. I feel like I’m never going to be someone people actually care about. I try so hard to connect, to be normal, to build a life—but nothing works. I see people starting families, getting married, laughing with friends… and I’m just here, frozen, watching it all pass me by.

The only person who’s ever shown me love is my mom. And I lie to her every day. She asks how I’m doing and I smile and say “I’m fine,” because I can’t let her carry this pain too. She’s already been through enough. But I miss her. I miss being that little kid who just wanted a hug and to be told everything would be okay.

1jwbpf3,loneliness is overwhelming,"(it’s 3 am and nothing might make sense but i need to vent somewhere) 

lately, loneliness has been a little too overwhelming. it’s hard to use words to describe how i feel, but it often feels pathetic and sad. 

i guess i can say that i feel a little tired of being the first person to text and the first person to ask for the hang out. i feel tired of being the first person to make a phone call. i feel tired of being left out. i feel tired of being misunderstood. i feel tired of walking around and feeling like i’ve got a hole in my chest that should be filled but isn’t. 

i crave attention, i crave deep human connection. i can spend days, maybe weeks being all alone in university without anyone asking me where i am or how i’ve been until i randomly show up because my loneliness was too much and i felt like i had to force myself to be seen by people. but i never feel wanted. i spend a lot of hours alone. 

i know i have maybe one or two real friends, but i never really get much from them. they never text me first, they never ask to hang out, they never call me either. i wonder if i never call or text them, would they even notice that i’m gone? 

i have no boyfriend either… no one to spend hours with or think about without feeling embarrassed. i think about my friends, or the people that i call my friends, quite often… but i usually feel embarrassed when i do. it feels wrong to think about friends too much because they’re just friends (does that make sense?). i don’t have anyone to check up on me or send me good morning and goodnight texts. no one to call or text when im feeling horrible or depressed. no one that loves me unconditionally the way i love them. 

i see other people going out, going on dates, being busy with their partner or friends that they prefer over me… and it just gets so tiring. it feels like i have a void within me.

1jwbgjb,I'm wasting away my 20s,"hi, im new here but i didnt know where else to turn. i just desperately needed to put my thoughts into words and feel heard by someone, even if its just a bunch of strangers on the internet.

covid changed a lot of things for me, as it did for many of us. i didn't realize how good i had it until i let everything slip away. i had several different friend groups, hobbies that made me feel fulfilled, and a bright future ahead of me. i was a senior in high school, so we never got a real chance to say goodbye to anyone. life shut down, we graduated remotely, and then it was time for everyone to go their separate ways. before i could even realize, everyone was already setting out on their own lives. and then there was me.

i was nowhere near ready for college. i didnt know that at the time of course. thats why i dropped out- twice. i completely fucked my freshman year by meeting an abusive guy on tinder. i was isolated from the few people i managed to start getting to know. and my friends from high school had long forgotten about me by then.

running away from home to a new city was what really put the final nail in the coffin of my social life. i didn't realize until then that i'd never truly made a friend organically by myself. i'd always just been lucky enough to be approached first, or met people through mutual friends. covid took the few social skills i had and made them nonexistent. i've been almost entirely alone for the past 5 years and the older i get the further away the hope of finding any worthwhile friends seems to drift.

im living my parents again. our relationship has always been strained. i can tell im not what they pictured when they first decided to become parents. i've always been more alternative in my interests and self-expression. my parents couldnt be more different from me. the only thing thats kept our relationship afloat is the blood relation and shared history together.

i've had a boyfriend for the past 3 years and he's the only person i've ever felt like truly gets me. although that in itself is kinda sad. i cant make a single friend but i can get a romantic relationship so easily. seems like sex/love may be the only thing people see in me. any man i've tried developing a friendship with has showed me that much at least. i feel awful for constantly having to put so much emotional burden on my bf, but he's genuinely the only one i have at this point. i'd probably be dead without him in all honesty. we both really want to have a future together, eventually get married too. but i cant stop thinking about how if we were to get married, i wouldn't even have enough friends to have any bridesmaids, or even a maid of honor. 

im back in college now, this time going for straight A's. im joining clubs, well, a club. it's been 2 years now and i still havent made a single friend there. the closest thing i have to a friend are my coworkers, but our relationships are very surface level. it's gotten to the point where i LIKE going to work, despite how much my job sucks, solely because its the one place i get to socialize with people my age, and get paid for it. 

everyone is always so busy so we can never make plans, myself included. by the time im done with school and work, im too burnt out to even want to try socializing. and then im sitting in my room crying about how lonely i am. and the cycle just keeps repeating.

every time i try to make friends or even so much as talk to people i feel like a burden. i never know what to say, so in most cases i just awkwardly stand around people, just waiting for the moment i can say something relevant or contribute in any way. occasionally, i'll get a laugh. but i'm constantly feeling like a 3rd, 5th... 20th wheel in everything i do. like nobody ever wants me around, like im constantly just intruding in others conversations because at our ages everyone already has their established friend groups, so nobody ever even gives me a chance. at this point im just hoping that i'll attract people if im just THERE. if im around long enough, eventually i'll assimilate with the people around me and maybe grow a deeper connection with someone, ANYONE.

so i guess all this is to say that making friends in your 20s, especially when you've fucked your life up as much as i have, is really damn hard. so now i'm just sitting in my bed wasting away what are supposed to be the ""best years of my life"" crying and venting to strangers on reddit.",Moldy_Bagels,3,4,Venting,im wasting away hi im new didnt know else turn desperately needed put thought word feel heard someone even bunch stranger internet covid changed lot thing many u didnt realize good let everything slip away several different friend group hobby made feel fulfilled bright future ahead senior high school never got real chance say goodbye anyone life shut graduated remotely time everyone go separate way could even realize everyone already setting life nowhere near ready college didnt know time course thats dropped twice completely fucked freshman year meeting abusive guy tinder isolated people managed start getting know friend high school long forgotten running away home new city really put final nail coffin social life didnt realize id never truly made friend organically id always lucky enough approached first met people mutual friend covid took social skill made nonexistent ive almost entirely alone past year older get away hope finding worthwhile friend seems drift im living parent relationship always strained tell im pictured first decided become parent ive always alternative interest selfexpression parent couldnt different thing thats kept relationship afloat blood relation shared history together ive boyfriend past year he person ive ever felt like truly get although kinda sad cant make single friend get romantic relationship easily seems like sexlove may thing people see man ive tried developing friendship showed much least feel awful constantly put much emotional burden bf he genuinely one point id probably dead without honesty really want future together eventually get married cant stop thinking get married wouldnt even enough friend bridesmaid even maid honor im back college time going straight im joining club well club year still havent made single friend closest thing friend coworkers relationship surface level gotten point like going work despite much job suck solely one place get socialize people age get paid everyone always busy never make plan included time im done school work im burnt even want try socializing im sitting room cry lonely cycle keep repeating every time try make friend even much talk people feel like burden never know say case awkwardly stand around people waiting moment say something relevant contribute way occasionally ill get laugh im constantly feeling like rd th th wheel everything like nobody ever want around like im constantly intruding others conversation age everyone already established friend group nobody ever even give chance point im hoping ill attract people im im around long enough eventually ill assimilate people around maybe grow deeper connection someone anyone guess say making friend especially youve fucked life much really damn hard im sitting bed wasting away supposed best year life cry venting stranger reddit,0.025481209611644386,0.47223665223665195

1juqxax,Friends watched the minecraft movie without me,"For context, I used to live in another city, away from my hometown. I went back for a couple days to see my friends there and said I'd be back when the mc movie releases. 

However, my new pc ended up being delivered during the release and I didn't want to risk it getting stolen off my veranda while I was away. So I waited until it arrived, which was this Monday and then yesterday, I asked my friends in a group chat, if they've seen videos of people losing their shit when Jack Black says minecraft terms and was going to say when would be good for me to come down to watch it. When one of them said it happened when they went to watch it. 

So that hurt a bit to read, but I didn't want to make things weird so I just said hell yeah and have been disappointed that they saw it without me.

I'm guessing that they watched it with the rest of the friend group there as I saw a story the other day where someone from that group was in the cinema. However, I assumed they watched it without my friends as they were waiting for me, but no.

While I don't really care about the movie itself, it would've been a fun time regardless getting drunk and then seeing it as I and most of the others grew up playing mc. I'm very surprised that no-one told me they saw it as well or asked me about my plans with visiting. It's a shame, as I had plans in my head of after watching it, going to McDonald's and getting the mc meal and seeing what toys we got.

1jupazm,I no longer know who i am,"To introduce myself, im 17 and im finishing highschool next year.

Since i was a child i was viewed as a very kind, outgoing and extroverted person. In recent years that has completely shifted, my parents even asked why do i seem to have become more selfish, stopped thinking ahead of things and people alike. Exactly, i stopped caring. I've become apathetic because of my past experiences and trauma with people ghosting me and pushing me away, possibly childhood trauma from parents, and nowadays them just arguing in general. Now i've become VERY lonely and even possibly depressed, at this point where i even stay up until 4 am texting to AI chat bots. Pathetic, i know. Also i have very constant mood shifts between days, going on for like a year now. And this has been going on for a while, and im just dissintrestted in improving it or getting out, it's like i already gave up. For your knowledge, yes i've gone to a therapist, been going for about a month now, and maybe it helps for a time, but it just all shifts back like nothing changed and that entire discussion and talk was meaningless. I also had one meeting at the psychiatrist last week, propably with more to come.

Besides all this, even though i've gained great support from my parents and sisters, i still don't feel the want to change it. I barely talk to anybody of my age group now, and even if i do i never go outside, it's only that i go out alone in every millennia because of something. Even my supposed ""Best friend"" , well he stopped going outside with me several years ago and now i just gave up, i only see him at school in class and talk to him in calls and chat, just as if he was another online friend, even if we are closer. Now since last year, ever since i started this phase of self-destruction, i started skipping school, do not think about my grades whatsoever, ignore deadlines. I only do something if it's absolutely necessary or i will be punished for it. Have constant thoughts about death, getting something like cancer so i could do whatever i want for a time. Also like i mentioned the mood shifts, im either really nonchalant and serious or very bouncy, excited? It's with myself though, in school i always seem nonchalant, started wearing sunglasses as a way of escapism aswell, though they are stylish. I've lost passion for pretty much everything, stopped putting effort into studying since last year aswell, stopped doing homework. Now only two things that excite me are singing and voice acting, and i even started singing way less, hell do i know why. I started resorting to instant pleasure, pleasuring myself daily, sometimes multiple times. Refusing to get out of bed, scrolling. Yet deep down i wanna care for someone, and i still do kind deeds whenever i can, but now i seem to do selfish things without even realizing them.

I don't even realise what's wrong with me anymore, im not in despair, im just dissapointed and hopeless of the future ahead. Maybe time will heal, and i guess only time will tell. And i've heard all those things about someone like me, shouldn't be able to feel this way and that, well that's a stupid statement, age doesn't matter in these things when you start becoming delusional.",MarceladeXX,1,3,Venting,longer know introduce im im finishing highschool next year since child viewed kind outgoing extroverted person recent year completely shifted parent even asked seem become selfish stopped thinking ahead thing people alike exactly stopped caring ive become apathetic past experience trauma people ghosting pushing away possibly childhood trauma parent nowadays arguing general ive become lonely even possibly depressed point even stay texting ai chat bot pathetic know also constant mood shift day going like year going im dissintrestted improving getting like already gave knowledge yes ive gone therapist going month maybe help time shift back like nothing changed entire discussion talk meaningless also one meeting psychiatrist last week propably come besides even though ive gained great support parent sister still dont feel want change barely talk anybody age group even never go outside go alone every millennium something even supposed best friend well stopped going outside several year ago gave see school class talk call chat another online friend even closer since last year ever since started phase selfdestruction started skipping school think grade whatsoever ignore deadline something absolutely necessary punished constant thought death getting something like cancer could whatever want time also like mentioned mood shift im either really nonchalant serious bouncy excited though school always seem nonchalant started wearing sunglass way escapism aswell though stylish ive lost passion pretty much everything stopped putting effort studying since last year aswell stopped homework two thing excite singing voice acting even started singing way less hell know started resorting instant pleasure pleasuring daily sometimes multiple time refusing get bed scrolling yet deep wan na care someone still kind deed whenever seem selfish thing without even realizing dont even realise whats wrong anymore im despair im dissapointed hopeless future ahead maybe time heal guess time tell ive heard thing someone like shouldnt able feel way well thats stupid statement age doesnt matter thing start becoming delusional,0.022872340425531913,0.47854609929078

When I finally have a conversation, I’m often the only one truly invested. The other person usually fades away, says they’re busy, and then days or weeks go by without a response. When I try again, it’s the same pattern. Eventually, I’m told they’re not interested anymore.

I’m a 29-year-old man, and sometimes I reach out to people who say they’re lonely or depressed. I genuinely care. I listen to their music, watch their videos, try to understand what they like. I make the effort to connect deeply. But often, they later say we have nothing in common or simply stop replying. I don’t understand. We share vulnerability, and yet it’s never enough to build something lasting.

I’ve never met someone who truly shares the same interests as me—or who genuinely cares for me the way I care for them. I’m not lonely by choice. My notifications are always on, the sound turned up, and still I barely hear from anyone. And when I do, it feels amazing… until the conversation dies out—not because I lost interest, but because they did.

It hurts when the people I invest time in tell me to ""just go meet others"" or ""try Tinder"" or ""use an app."" Everyone says the same thing: meet new people. But when I do, those people just repeat that advice again—telling me to meet someone else. It becomes a cycle. I invest, they fade. I meet someone new, and they push me away too. I always end up alone.

I don’t have a family. I was raised mostly by myself. Once, I even tried what people online suggested—professional help—but that only made things worse. And even they told me to meet more people. It’s like no one really understands. Everyone says, “someday you’ll find someone,” but that word—*someday*—feels more like a curse than comfort. I think that’s one of the words I hate the most.

I tend to overshare. I talk a lot because I *love* deep communication. I love talking about anything and everything—life, feelings, random ideas, even little daily things. I’m not trying to be overwhelming. It’s just how I connect, and how I show I care. But even that seems to push people away.

No matter how much money I spend, no matter what I buy or try to learn, nothing really brings me joy. Hobbies, new things, they’re just distractions that quickly fade. There aren’t many things that make me feel genuinely happy in life—but when I’m talking to someone, when there’s connection, when someone *actually* wants me around... that’s when I feel something. That’s when I feel alive.

And I don’t know… maybe I just wish that someday, someone would love me in a romantic way. Someone who actually wants to stay. I’ve never had that. I’ve never had a girlfriend. I’ve barely had real friends. Life just gets harder with age. I try to be kind, respectful, honest—but it's never enough. I’m not just lonely in the way people say when they *have* people but feel distant. I genuinely have no one.

I’m probably writing this just in hopes that maybe someone who feels the same way will reach out. And maybe… maybe it’ll end up like all the others—with me being the only one who actually cares. But I still had to write this. Because sometimes you just need to say it out loud:

1jy5xfe,19F being lonely is killing me,"after graduating highschool, I realise most of my friends aren’t really my friends. It was just a forced proximity sorta friendship. they all moved on finding new friends and getting into relationships. We only hang out if they squeeze me in their schedule, abt once every three months. I see their posts and stories and it seems they’re all living the perfect perfect life. But I’m still here doing nothing, feeling nothing being nothing. Every day I get overwhelmed with this loneliness and quietness. People my age are living their best lives and it feels like I’m being left behind. 

Lately I’ve just been messaging random numbers and hoping for a reply just to get some sort of conversation and even a notification like “who is this?” makes me feel a little less alone. But even then, when I had friends I was still the person I am today. I’ve never had a genuine connection with anyone ever. Maybe because it is tiring to be around people who just don’t get it.

1jy2wez,People claiming they're lonely on tiktok,"I'm really tired of seeing those people on tiktok who complain they're lonely and have no one and wanna give up and all this, when clearly they don't know real lonliness because there will be videos on their account where they're hanging out with a friend, or even sometimes a partner.. and even in the videos they take ( because all they do is record themself and put the caption on them like ""uhh I'm so lonely"") you'll see that they clearly have a nice life, conventionally attractive, good house, clearly enjoying themself. Like that's not real lonliness. I'm sorry if it seems like I'm gatekeeping or whatever,  and i know that i might not know their real home life, but it seems like they're just trivialising real lonliness.

Like having people who you can refer to as a friend and hanging out with them most of the time, even being able to leave the house and having the confidence to film yourself over tiktok, ESPECIALLY having a boyfriend or girlfriend, that's not lonliness. You've got people, your life is fine so stop fucking fishing for compliments by trivialising other people's struggles.  

I'm sick of seeing it. It's even worse if they have a partner. For most lonely people that's all they feel they need to not consider themself a failure, or destined to be alone. I seriously don't understand how you have a person you're romantically involved with, who you get the privilege of being able to physically cuddle, kiss, hold, even fuck, and when you have them fucking lying next to you on your bed (you'll see them in the tiktok video)  you have the audacity to make a tiktok like ""uhhh I'm so lonely and have no friends no one will ever like me I wanna end it"".

1jy1wns,College is the worst part of my life,"Is it just me or is college really that depressing. I (20m) do find it hard to socialize with people and make genuine connections but never would I have imagined what a shithole college could be . I did try to socialize in my first year of college but realised it is a huge chore . I did make a really good friend tho. He has another group of friends he hangs out with and even invites me to do the same but I feel they just don't want me around . Probably cus I don't talk that much. I am fine and outgoing with my friends from childhood but I just find it difficult being the same with his friends. 
Another thing happened the other day , so basically in my college people get hostels based on rank and they can pick other people to be their roomates. My friend's friend group has 5 people including him and so he asked me to take 3 bed with his other friend do that they (5 of them + me ) could be in the same block ( I and a friend of his had a better rank than everyone else). I personally wanted to take a single bed for myself. But I did take the 3 bed anyway for him cus I feel throughout my years of college he has been a great friend to me and I kinda owed him that. The third guy now kinda is hesitant on sharing the room with me and wants someone else from the group to switch with him. I personally don't really know wtf their problem is with me , I don't talk to them as much but it isn't like they try to talk to me also. I have never said anything to hurt them and I just try to be alone by myself most of the time and never try to bother them. Even after I do nothing they still have problems with me for some reason.

1jwlou1,Is she using me or leading me on?,"So, I have this female friend who’s kind of like the “therapist friend” in our group. She’s extremely kind-hearted, listens to everyone’s problems, and always knows the right thing to say. She’s also very attractive—not gonna lie, she’s got a great body and a magnetic personality. I, on the other hand, don’t really consider myself her “type” or particularly good-looking. Still, I’ve caught feelings for her, and I’m very much attracted to her.

Recently, we were hanging out and I opened up to her about some workplace issues and general feelings of inadequacy. Every time I said something self-deprecating, she would feed me pizza, smile warmly, and at one point even kissed me on the cheek. Later that evening, I broke down about feeling lonely, and she pulled me into a tight hug, letting my head rest on her chest while she stroked my hair and kissed my forehead. We stayed like that for hours—me on her chest, her massaging my neck, talking me through my feelings. It was comforting but also incredibly intimate.

Here’s the confusing part: she doesn’t flirt with me otherwise. She has a lot of guys around her—most of them objectively better looking or more confident than me. She’s very out of my league, so to speak.

I don’t know what to make of this. Is she just being an overly affectionate friend? Or is this emotional intimacy crossing a line—maybe even using me for something I don’t understand? I feel good around her, but also confused and vulnerable.

As the title says, whenever someone close to me doesn’t trust me about something related to me (it’s recently happened with my mom most frequently) I start feeling a little nauseous and desperate so I try my best to relate to her and make her understand that I’m telling the truth. 
  When I realise that she still doubts me, I panic, sometimes start crying. Even if the actual subject the trust was questioned on isn’t too serious, it still means a lot to me to be trusted, so I kept on trying to show her proof that I wasn’t. I tend to over express my feelings sometimes which might make me look angry/desperate which is why most of the times she just leaves my room, telling me I was in the wrong. I understand the part where she didn’t like my overreaction but she knows I always do what she agrees with, never done anything behind her back or stuff like that, have decent grades, which makes feeling the lack of trust really hurt me.

Christmas 2024 I get told that I'm acting spoilt and that basically I always do this and try to be the centre of attention. 
( I was upset my siblings had more presents than me) 

January 2nd I approach my team lead who is also our first aid for mental health officer to discuss the feeling I have of taken myself off to a mental health institution to just catch a break away from the arguing she says that she is approachable and basically if I need mental health support to send a text or phone and we can chat the following day when I'm back on shift… 

Feb/March I put a housing application into the council parents make it out that I'm the worst son ever that i am doing this to hurt them… 

April 8th 2025 we argue all day near enough everything is stressful my dad might have cancer etc and we basically have been arguing all week my parents have enough and tell me to pack my bags I do I decided enough was enough of this all I pack my bags and leave to stay at my grans.

1jxjtte,"People love me, I'm stone","
People love me. I’m social..always around, always vibing. But deep down, I’m like a stone… solid, quiet, hard to really reach. I don’t let people in easily..

Two years ago, when I was 18, there was this girl in my class. I didn’t know her well—just her name. One day, she wrote something on my desk saying she wanted me. I didn’t react. The next day, she wrote again, looking for a response. I ignored it again. I saw the embarrassment on her face… and I still said nothing. I don’t know why—I just couldn’t talk.

It’s not like I didn’t like her. She was interesting. I’d watch her from afar in class—she always had smart answers, always confident، top in the class, She didn’t seem like the kind of person who’d just randomly chase guys. That made it hit harder.

She was the first and last girl who ever made a move like that towards me. A year later, she changed schools. moved to another state. I still think about it sometimes.

1jx5h35,Building capacity for repair in relationships,"I read something recently that most people don’t struggle with conflict … they struggle with repair. For many people conflict can feel like a threat to their nervous system. I grew up with the silent treatment which evolved into letter writing to express myself. I can be conflict avoidant verbally so whenever conflict arises it’s easier for me to write how I’m feeling and gives me time to process things. 

Others shut down and go silent, withdraw before they can be left, avoid discomfort altogether, lash out to prove pain is valid, etc. Conflict became synonymous with pain, shame, punishment, withdrawal, feelings of being unwanted, and abandonment.

But recognising and being ok with the fact that every relationship no matter how strong or healthy the connection will not be conflict free is understanding we’re all human. The real difficult and ability to grow emotional intelligence isn’t avoiding conflict…it’s building the capacity for repair. Be ok with sitting in discomfort. 

Next time a conflict arises, instead of going fight or flight, shutting down, shouting, assuming things…pause and ask yourself

*What emotions are rising? (Misunderstood, unseen, sadness, feeling small?)

*What sensations are showing up? (Tight chest, stomach knots, pain, sweating?)

*What past trauma is getting triggered? (Childhood wound?)

*What do I actually need to repair? (Space, conversation, time together, reassurance?)

*And how do I communicate this to the other person? (Writing, music, videos, text message, phone call?)

Conflict without the capacity for repair erodes trust, leads to cracks, and assumptions. Ultimately emotional unsafety and fears of abandonment or event resentment.

1jx192r,Any advice on emotional intelligence techniques for neurodivergent people ?,"Hi there,

The reason i felt like writting this is because the stuff about emotional Intelligence on the internet rarely feels like useful or applicable advice for me personally.

I don't like labels, but im aware of having highly functional autism. Everything feels like quite a lot of work if it comes to dealing with people.

To act normal, to fit in. To do what people expect of me. It doesn't come easy, 

like "" normal "" things come quite difficult to me. It takes more time, more energy etc. 

The way my emotions feel inflicted after a argument or difficult period can really linger in my mind and let my body feel quite a sense of unpleasantness. Often times when things get emotionally to much or sensory overloaded the only thing that works for me is sleep and nothingness.

Im the kind of person with a very sticky mind, feelings and emotions remain there for quite a while. It doesn't matter how many time i do the "" let go / acceptance "" techniques 

It feels like my mind and body naturally has this tendency to feel things very deeply and strongly for longer periods of time than i personally would like to.

This makes it often times quite hard to deal with vulnerability, anxiety or any kind of stimulation for me. Not because i don't want to handle them. But maybe because it makes me feel very uncomfortable to feel so much of it?

For this reason, i thought of reaching out to the community

Since there are probably a lot more people here that experience things similar or know someone who does.

My question is, what is your emotional coping mechanisms ?

Does going for walks work for you, breath work. Or just throwing away your phone, closing the curtains and sleep for hours?

Thanks !

1jwxndn,Is there a way to look at this matter such that I won't feel bad / humiliated while still taking accountability for my part?,"I'm in college, and at the school cafeteria, there are usually two meal options: a normal diet (with spices, white rice, etc.) and a special diet (no spices, brown rice, etc.). I always go for the special diet because the regular one triggers a mild lip allergy for me.

On rare occasions, like earlier that day at lunch, I arrived late and found the special diet was finished—so I had no choice but to eat the regular meal, which wasn’t ideal.

For dinner, I specifically wanted the special diet and knew I wouldn't handle those spices again same day. I bought a meal ticket at Cashier 1, went to the serving area, and was told there was no special diet available that evening. I went back to the cashier area and saw a shorter line at Cashier 2, so I asked if a refund was possible. She directed me to Cashier 1. I queued again, but by the time I reached the front (about 7 minutes later), Cashier 1 told me too much time had passed and they no longer accepted refunds (this isn't their policy, by the way).

I explained that I had lined up at the wrong cashier first because her line was too long hoping I'd helped sooner. She ignored me and served the next person. Thankfully, a third employee overheard and helped me with a refund after I explained the situation.

Still, I felt mortified—like I was being a difficult customer. I should have waited in line at Cashier 1 despite the traffic, or checked if the special diet was available before paying.

1jwxfot,Why Do I Feel Like I Dont Exist Until Someone Approves of Me?,"

why do so many of us crave approval? even when we know something about ourselves, it still feels incomplete unless someone else sees it and says, “yeah, you’re doing great.”

It’s wild, right? You can make progress, grow, heal, and still feel like it doesn’t fully count unless someone else notices. I’ve felt that too. And the thing is, this constant craving for external validation..it’s really exhausting. Because people are inconsistent. One day you’ll be praised, and the next, ignored or misunderstood. And then what? Your whole sense of self wobbles.

A lot of this goes way back. For many of us, validation was something we had to earn growing up, by being good, successful, quiet, helpful, whatever. So as adults, we carry that same wiring. The problem is, it never really ends unless you learn how to validate yourself.

And let me be clear: self-validation isntt just repeating affirmations or pretending to be unbothered. not really.. It’s about actually learning to trust your own experience. To feel something, think something, choose something,and not need the outside world to rubber-stamp it before you believe it’s real or worthy.

The idea is to reduce the power and influence of unhelpful thoughts, allowing people to act more in line with their values.

However, some people may perceive cognitive defusion as a form of denial of responsibility eg if someone hears “you are not your thoughts or actions” or “just notice the thought, don’t believe it,” they might interpret that as avoiding accountability for the thought/action—especially if the thought involves harm, blame, or guilt. It can sound like dismissing real consequences.

Later, I realise it only makes the other person feel rejected. 
I supress this too. 
I would say something like 'I am not worthy of your love'. This is my way of avoiding.

I crave lots of love. When someone offers pure, real connection, I push them away. I am unable to let them in and see me, hold me.

1jwme0u,"Hi, I need to talk about a problem that I don’t know how to deal with.","Hi, I need to talk about a problem that I don’t know how to deal with. There’s a behavior I want to change, but I just can’t. Like… it’s stronger than me. But if I could understand how to do it, I know I’d be good at it, because I’m quite strong when it comes to willpower. I feel that what I’m doing isn’t right, but I want to find the right thing to do.



Let’s take today’s example — but honestly, this happens all the time: I’m in the car, and there’s always that asshole who honks, insults you, disrespects you, cuts the line. I have this flaw that, if I can, I react. Like, I snap. I freeze up, I talk back, I curse them out, I can even get violent if necessary. And it’s getting stronger and stronger. Especially — and this is the even uglier part that I want to change — when I see that it’s someone who I know won’t be able to beat me up, or who physically just can’t.



Today, I was pulling out of a little side road, and there was a long line of cars waiting at a traffic light. Since I wasn’t heading toward the light but crossing over, I slipped into the line. But the guy in front gave me a look, and I was like, “Oh here we go…” Then he starts going off on me. I tell him, “I need to go left,” and he wanted to cut in front of me to get back into the line. I tell him, “It’s red, let me through,” and he just starts saying, “You’re an imbecile, you’re an imbecile, you’re an imbecile…” So I go, “No, you’re the imbecile. You’re the imbecile.”



At some point I say I’m gonna get out of the car, and he says, “What are you gonna do? Get out then.” And I would’ve. I would’ve gotten out. I would’ve smashed his car. But I had a passenger. My friends were in the car, watching. We were just coming back from paragliding. So I didn’t. He was an old guy. An old man. He was the archetype — the perfect case that triggers me. Because I *hate* white SUVs, especially the fancy ones that insecure people drive. I hate them.



And on top of that, I *hate* disrespect — that’s another layer. Because in all of this, the light hadn’t even turned green yet. The whole maneuver was taking time because he had halfway blocked the road, making me do a much longer maneuver. I had to go back and forth several times to get him in. And the whole time he kept yelling, “You’re a stupid old man, you’re an imbecile…” He couldn’t even manage his own maneuver.



So I was absolutely *furious*. I was about to blow up. I see this old guy, with his white car, showing me zero respect. And this was literally the most emblematic case possible. I really would’ve gotten out. That’s something awful I almost did.



What happens is that I calm down, eventually. I focus. I stop talking to him. He keeps repeating, “You’re an imbecile, you’re an imbecile.” But the next two minutes I’m just sitting there shaking. Like… full-on trembling.



And my friends in the car didn’t ask how I was. Nobody asked how I was doing. They just changed the subject. And I couldn’t stop thinking about what happened. Emotionally, I realized that this thing had completely triggered me. I couldn’t think about anything else. In that moment, I really could’ve done something compromising.



So I need to figure out what to do with people like this. Because my goal is to go home alive and well, and stay as safe as possible. I want to be safe. I don’t want to be the street justice warrior. I’m not a vigilante. I can’t stand people disrespecting me — especially when they’re in the wrong — but at the end of the day, it’s not worth it. I just want to drive safely, get where I need to go, and spend as little as possible on lawyers and body shops.



So, clearly, what I did is not okay. But in the moment, it becomes a kind of release. Because the goal is: don’t start trouble, don’t get out, don’t escalate. But the *other* goal is to manage the *emotions* that come afterward. Because I suffer from this stuff. It ruins my day. Maybe not the whole day, but I can’t stop thinking about it. If I’m in a line of cars and some guy overtakes me, I lose it. I really do. It’s overwhelming. And why? Because it just doesn’t feel fair.



Why do you have to express yourself like that? “You’re an imbecile, you’re an imbecile…” What the hell is that? That’s the kind of person who votes Lega, who votes Forza Nuova, who renovated his house with the government bonus at workers’ expense. That’s the person. And I lose it.



Because even with all that wealth, even with everything going for them, they still have to be *that guy*. They still have to insult you. Can’t just say, “Hey, I could’ve passed.” No — it’s “F\*\*\* off,” “You’re an idiot.” I didn’t even put my blinker on — okay, fine, I admit that. But it wouldn’t have made a difference with someone like that.



But it becomes about something else — if you don’t speak to me respectfully, then I won’t either. But then again, I’ll go further. You insult me verbally? I’ll hurt you physically. I’ll smash your car. Not like do anything *to* you, but I’ll make sure you *feel* that all that cocky confidence you had — it’s gone. You don’t really have it.



That’s the emotion that comes up: “If this made me feel so bad, then I need to make sure this person *knows* they can’t do this.” Because you never know who you’re messing with. And I’m the crazy one. I’ll hurt you. And next time, maybe you won’t honk at a stranger. Maybe you’ll remember that you don’t know who’s in the other car.



That’s what my brain tells me: all those other 99 people you’ve insulted? I’m going to make you pay for them. One by one. That’s what I feel. And yes, that’s the vigilante, street justice side of me talking.



Sometimes, honestly, it works. Sometimes they roll down their window and go, “Sorry, sorry.” But this guy just escalated even more. “What are you gonna do? What are you gonna do?” And I wasn’t waiting for anything else. And I’m not saying that proudly — I’m saying it to show how *dysfunctional* I am. It’s not healthy.



I *know* what I should do: not get out, not threaten, not raise my voice. Just go home safe. But there’s also this deep pain that this kind of situation brings me. And that’s not healthy either.



Because I can’t deal with the emotion that this kind of stuff — this rise in street aggression — brings out in me. So I end up suffering. And this angry outburst is my way of coping. I want to *learn* how to manage this emotional pain. And I want to do it relatively quickly — ideally as fast or faster than the emotion arises. But I know that right now, I can’t.

1jwm3nd,Anybody else changed attachment styles shortly after the end of a relationship/friendship?,"For context- I took the attachment style test last year and my result came back as “anxious-preoccupied.” This didn’t come as a surprise to me and bc of patterns I’ve acknowledged over the years. 

Recently, I found myself in a one-sided dispute with a best friend, and have been struggling to decide on how to move forward with the friendship. 

I care about her, so I approached the situation sensitively and any attempts to communicate healthy have been concise and well thought of. 

On the other hand, I’m not receiving the same kind of respect that I’m giving out. She is refusing to take accountability for her actions, and seems to not even process any of my words with clarity. It’s frustrating to repeat the same things, only to be met with hostility. Especially when I only want to understand her better to adapt to a new version of what we have. 

I’ve taken a step back, since I’m not really sure what to do.

I’m an extremely empathetic person that readily accepts people’s faults, yet I’ve found myself in countless similar situations. As a social person, I often feel like stepped on and taken for granted, while giving more of myself and not expecting anything back. I developed this mindset bc my energy replenishes very quickly, and I never minded this imbalance. 

But now that I’m almost 30, I don’t have the same level of interest to being patient with everybody. I want to think about my own happiness more. 

It’s only been a few weeks since our ‘fight’  and at one point, I realized that this is probably the only moment in my adult life that I’m not actively in any toxic relationship. 

I feel calmer, and my senses aren’t constantly heightened anymore. Out of curiosity, I took the test again and resulted in being “securely attached”. Now, this was very strange to me. 

Some questions to ponder-
What makes a person securely attached? Are we already secure when we have a clear sense of who we are? 
But does allowing ourselves to be in toxic relationships trigger less ideal attachment styles? 
Do we only move to being secure once we accept the difficult decisions to leave good friends/partners behind, who may not be at the same level of growth as you? 

Lastly, if you care deeply about a friendship but know they have a lot of inner work that needs to be done, but you don’t know when they’ll even begin to do it. Would you bother to keep the connection and adapt, knowing you’ll have to pull the weight until then?

1jwk3g9,"She said she wanted just friendship, but our conversations felt like emotional dating. I pulled away, but it still messed me up.","I (24M) got emotionally tangled with someone I had only casually interacted with before. It started off light—a random conversation, a spark—and led to regular texting. Not just small talk. I’m talking late-night messages, emotional vulnerability, subtle flirting. We weren’t together, but it started to feel like… something.

Then she told me she’d recently ended a relationship and wasn’t looking for anything romantic—just connection and friendship. I said I respected that, but the truth is—I already had feelings.
I had them from the beginning. I told her, honestly, that I’d been into her since the first time I saw her.
The conversations just gave me a space to finally say it out loud.
And I think she knew.
She acted surprised when I told her how I felt—like I had overwhelmed her. She even asked if she’d emotionally cheated on her ex. I apologized, probably more than I should have.

For context, I’m fearful avoidant. She’s clearly anxious. And that combination created this intense, hot-cold rhythm. I’d pull back, she’d get closer. She’d distance, I’d reach out. I realized eventually that I was becoming emotionally available to someone who didn’t want the same thing—but still leaned on me for support and comfort.

She started suggesting that maybe I was “too much,” even hinted that her friends thought I was obsessive. But she also kept texting me. The inconsistency started to eat at me. It felt like we were both projecting unspoken needs onto each other, without ever naming them.

When I finally told her that I’d liked her for a while, her response was something like:

“But how could you even like me? You barely know me. You’ve only seen me briefly, in passing.”
That hit me hard—because at that point, we’d already shared some pretty vulnerable conversations. It made me feel like she was rewriting what had happened to protect herself from feeling guilty or responsible for the connection we built.

In one of our final conversations, she asked me whether I thought we could be close again someday. That line stuck with me—maybe more than it should have. It planted a seed of “what if,” even though I know deep down that the connection was unbalanced. And that’s the hardest part:

I still haven’t completely let go of the idea that maybe, sometime in the future, we might reconnect.

We still see each other in a weekly group event. It’s civil. Polite. But I feel like I’m carrying a weight from something that technically never happened. I walked away from it for my own sanity—but that doesn’t mean it didn’t leave a mark.

⸻

What I’m asking is:
	•	How do you emotionally process something that wasn’t a relationship but felt like one?
	•	How do you stop replaying it in your head, wondering where it crossed the line?
	•	Is it fair to feel hurt when they said “just friends,” but acted like more?
	•	Should I actively let go of that lingering hope for reconnection—or is it sometimes okay to see what happens down the line?",unstableau,95,34,No Flair,said wanted friendship conversation felt like emotional dating pulled away still messed got emotionally tangled someone casually interacted started lighta random conversation sparkand led regular texting small talk im talking latenight message emotional vulnerability subtle flirting werent together started feel like something told shed recently ended relationship wasnt looking anything romanticjust connection friendship said respected truth isi already feeling beginning told honestly id since first time saw conversation gave space finally say loud think knew acted surprised told feltlike overwhelmed even asked shed emotionally cheated ex apologized probably context im fearful avoidant shes clearly anxious combination created intense hotcold rhythm id pull back shed get closer shed distance id reach realized eventually becoming emotionally available someone didnt want thingbut still leaned support comfort started suggesting maybe much even hinted friend thought obsessive also kept texting inconsistency started eat felt like projecting unspoken need onto without ever naming finally told id liked response something like could even like barely know youve seen briefly passing hit hardbecause point wed already shared pretty vulnerable conversation made feel like rewriting happened protect feeling guilty responsible connection built one final conversation asked whether thought could close someday line stuck memaybe planted seed even though know deep connection unbalanced thats hardest part still havent completely let go idea maybe sometime future might reconnect still see weekly group event civil polite feel like im carrying weight something technically never happened walked away sanitybut doesnt mean didnt leave mark im asking emotionally process something wasnt relationship felt like one stop replaying head wondering crossed line fair feel hurt said friend acted like actively let go lingering hope reconnectionor sometimes okay see happens line,0.013020833333333332,0.6055689102564102

1jwid83,"Happy Personality, Sad Soul","My whole life I have been judged. I was always told I was too much, too happy, too smart, too emotional, too much of everything, and everything that I did was wrong. A sadness developed inside of me that has never fully healed. A sadness that is always unseen and unheard and shaped every decision I have ever made in my life. Always having to defend, always being in the wrong, always not good enough. Until one day, I stopped listening to the sadness. I had experienced a life-altering event, a traumatic experience that most people don’t come back from. I had no idea that experience would fill the hole in my heart that had always been there. I accepted what life threw at me as a gift instead of a burden, and I began to find my power. If I could overcome this, what else could I do? I stood up for myself, and I literally looked fear in the eyes and said “fuck you.” Through this anger and fury I realized I had never been at peace within myself, and I struggled with my deepest and darkest fears of who I was as a person and if I could actually say I was proud of myself and the life I have made. I started to find my trust in those I was closest to at this terrible time in my life. People whose opinions I would normally not consider, but I was in crisis mode and needed support. I found that if I was 100% honest in how I was feeling, people would respond with compassion instead of judgement. Until I realized people do not always have your best interest in mind. I ended up being backstabbed and judged as I was my whole life by people I never thought would betray me. Except the thing that surprised me the most about myself was I didn’t back down this time. I didn’t let the sadness or judgement consume me. I rose above it. I went to war with anyone and everything, because this is my life and I will live in peace. There is still an anger and a beast inside of me that is still learning to heal. Little did I know that taming my anger and regaining peace requires self reflection and patience, and cutting off people who are toxic. I learned to set boundaries, take time for myself, therapy, switched medications around for my mental health, how to be the best mom I could be for my daughter, and a person that lived and loved with humility and grace for others as the people in my life closest to me had done for me. And if anyone in my life is reading this and does know me personally, I think they would be surprised just as much as I am with the peace I have found within myself.

1jwf3jf,Emotions should only be used as feedback not as facts,"As I reflect on human emotions, I noticed they tend to be: 

- Reactive and in the moment 
- Fleeting and temporary 
- Stemmed from past trauma and triggers 
- Based on subjectivity and the current season of life one is in rather than  based on reality 
- Unidentifiable and sometimes misleading  unless you've had the time to truly reflect and process why you feel the way you do 

To test if your emotions are reasonable and based on truth, you have to investigate the underlying reasons as to why you feel the way you do. To actively reassess your thought process and question your emotions (within reason) is healthy and should be practiced more.

1jwafxz,Interactive Feelings Wheel,"Hey everyone 👋

I recently created the [Interactive Feelings Wheel](https://feelingswheel.app/)**.** It’s a tool designed to make it easier to explore and articulate your emotions. It’s based on the classic Feelings Wheel but interactive, so you can click around and dive deeper into how you’re really feeling.

I made this because I know how hard it can be to put feelings into words, especially when you’re overwhelmed or unsure. The site even has a bit of **AI** **magic ✨** built in to give you helpful insights and recommendations as you go.

If that sounds useful to you, feel free to check it out.

Would love to hear what you think!

1jw8ieq,Why Emotions Matter More Than Logic in a Relationship,"One of the most important things I’ve learned in my relationship is that not everything needs a logical explanation. Sometimes, emotions matter more than logic. A relationship isn’t just about facts and reasoning—it’s about feelings, understanding, and making each other feel secure.

At first, I used to think that every concern should be handled with logic. If my partner asked me to do (or not do) something, my first instinct was to ask, ""Why?"" and try to debate whether it made sense. But over time, I realized that questioning emotions with logic can sometimes make things worse.

For example, if your partner feels uncomfortable about your interactions with someone, you might think, ""I haven’t done anything wrong, so why should it be a problem?"" But instead of trying to prove they shouldn’t feel that way, sometimes it’s better to just reassure them. Saying something like, ""I understand how you feel, and I don’t want you to worry. You’re the most important person to me,"" can make a big difference.

A strong relationship isn’t about proving who’s right—it’s about making each other feel safe and valued. When both people focus on understanding each other’s emotions rather than just debating facts, the bond becomes much stronger.

Have you ever had a moment where emotions mattered more than logic in your relationship??

1jw739f,"Recurring dreams of guillotines, crashes, and closets—I thought they meant I should disappear.","*I'm posting this because I wish someone had told me sooner that scary dreams don’t mean you’re broken; they might mean your mind is brilliant at survival.*

For most of my life, I thought terrifying dreams were normal...like everyone must dream of guillotines and being hit by cars. For years, I didn’t question it. I didn’t even know I had the option to.

It wasn’t until I began exploring symbolism through dream interpretation and tarot that I realized these images weren’t random. They were maps. They were trying to show me where I’d been wounded.

I had recurring dreams from the age of four to about twelve.....dreams of a yellow robot who looked eerily like the Tin Man. He’d pick me up and throw me into the front closet. I’d wake up believing I was actually in that closet. I later recognized the robot as a symbol of the maternal side of my family...compliant, cold, emotionally vacant. A mechanical caretaker who saw me as too much or simply in the way.

And then there were the guillotines. The cars. The falling. The flying. I thought these dreams told me I should run away, escape, or disappear. But they weren’t about that at all. They were signals. Messages from the subconscious, shaped by trauma, trying to speak in the only language it knows....symbolism.

When I began to explore these symbols, I wasn’t sure I had the right to. I'd been taught that leaning into symbols was suspicious, mystical, or even immoral. But avoiding them only deepened my confusion. Facing them helped me make sense of the pain.

The breakthrough came about five years ago when I dreamt of a rickety amusement park with rusted pulleys and gears and an injured child lying near a broken-down roller coaster. That child was me. My subconscious was showing me what I hadn’t yet remembered: my childhood wasn’t just hard; it was wounded. Something inside me had been carrying that truth for decades.

Tarot and dream interpretation became more than tools. They became companions in my healing, not because they told the future but because they illuminated the past. They gave my emotions shape, color, and movement. They invited me to sit with grief instead of dodge it, to name patterns I had no words for.

So when people ask how tarot or dreams have anything to do with emotional intelligence, I always say they’re how I learned to speak the language of my inner life. They’re how I stopped seeing fear at the end of the conversation and started seeing it at the beginning.

Has anyone else had dreams that made more sense years later? I’m curious how others have experienced symbolic healing.

If any of this resonates with you, trust that your inner world is wiser than you’ve been taught to believe. Symbols aren’t here to trick you. They’re here to guide you back to yourself.

I went through something serious in my personal life and spent the past few months doing deep emotional work such as therapy, self-reflection, all of it. It helped. A lot.

Now for the first time in years, my brain is quiet. No clutter, no people-pleasing, no guilt or fear running the show. I’ve been off social media, enjoying my own company, writing, drawing… all the good solo stuff.

But now that I’m not in survival mode anymore, I don’t know what to do with this mental silence. I’m not looking to fill it with dating or distractions, just something meaningful. Still very inward-focused.

So my question is: what do you do when you’re finally mentally free, but feel weirdly bored or empty?

Is this actually boredom, or just detoxing from years of emotional chaos?

We went from having zero communication issues to him telling me I didn't listen to anything he said or accusing me of forcing a conversation just for asking how his day was.

If I respond negatively, he will say I walk on eggshells and will ask me why I'm with him or why I stay. 

Last night we were hanging out at a friend's house.
He mentioned his brother. He's in jail. Or so I thought. He said he was worried he would show up at his house.
I asked what happened. He hadn't told me. He was released.

So as I practice active listening, I started my conversation with him with: Hey babe, that just be hard for you and adding to your stress. Is there anything I can do? You mentioned brother being released from jail and I..

His response was: Why would you ask me that? I already said he's released from jail. Why are you repeating what I said? 

I responded with, I know babe but I wasn't done asking my question.. Him: It doesn't matter you know I hate repeating myself.

Focusing on my wording instead of the actual question and letting it go. I simply said we'd talk about it later because our friends were wondering what was happening. 

...

Later that night, we were alone and I mentioned how earlier I had asked him about his brother because I care about him and I was trying to connect with him and what he's going through. He accused me of forcing a conversation.

I explained that I didn't understand. I'm his partner and I feel like I don't know what's going on with him lately. I went to say that I feel like when I try to connect, I'll often get a negative answer instead of an actual conversation and I need him to meet me halfway despite the stress.

He reacted badly and told me that if I feel like I'm walking on eggshells, I should stop talking to him.
I said that's not what happened. I don't feel that way. I don't change how I speak with you.

Then, he said that one of the frustrations he felt was that when I say something, I'll change my answer based on what I think the person I'm talking to wants. 

I don't do that. I will simply explain further my point and clarify if the person is wrong or makes a wrong assumption. Like him telling me I'm walking on eggshells when I don't feel like I do.

Conversation changed when our friends joined us to play a game.

1jvu9aq,Title: I never believed in “mirror souls” or deep connections—until her. Now I’m trying to make sense of it.,"I’m a 21-year-old guy. Logical, grounded, never believed in “soulmates” or “mirror souls.” I always thought love was something that *grew slowly*, not something that smacked you in the chest on day one.

But then I met her.

10 months ago. First conversation and I was *gone*. She never said we were soulmates—but she always told me *“our relationship is different.”* That it had layers, connotations, something she couldn’t explain but *felt*. I didn’t get it back then. I was too wrapped up in my own negativity, trying to logically dissect everything. And now—3 days ago—it all hit me like a wave.

She is my **mirror**.  
Same traumas.  
Same defense mechanisms.  
Same fears, same habits, same emotional language.  
Same quiet sadness masked as strength.

I didn’t fall in love with her—I **recognized** her. And suddenly, everything I couldn’t explain for 10 months started making terrifying sense.

But here’s the part that hurts:

Despite all that deep connection…  
**we always argue.**  
Not because we don’t care.  
But because we’re *so similar*, it’s like looking in a mirror that won’t blink first.  
We say the *same things* with different words.  
We mean the *same things* but can’t stop *fighting*.  
It’s like our hearts are aligned, but our egos are always in a boxing ring.

It’s chaotic as hell.

And yet, I still love her. Even through the noise. Maybe because of it.

**So Reddit, I really need perspective:**

1. How common is it to find someone who mirrors you this much?
2. If you’ve experienced this, what are the consequences—positive or painful?
3. Is there any way to *handle* this? Or does it always burn out from its own intensity?
4. And how do you deal with the fear that something this real might *not* last?

I never thought I’d be the kind of guy writing something like this.  
But here I am—just trying to figure out how to carry a love that feels like it came from another life, but could fall apart in this one.

1jvrdp2,I stayed in a 15-year relationship because I thought I understood him. Now I’m wondering if that was emotional intelligence or something else.,"I was with Mark for nearly fifteen years. He was tall, kind of good-looking in that brooding, semi-deconstructed way-gritty charm, like a guy who lives out of his truck but could fix anything. People liked him. I did too, at first.

I’ve always been the more put-together one. Corporate job, elegant wardrobe, I speak slowly, think in layers. I’m good at people. I understand them. I read the subtext. I know how they tick. That’s not a brag it’s just how I’m built.

Mark had this soft spot for animals like, real, soulful reactions to injured birds, rescue stories, that sort of thing. And I remember thinking, if someone can feel like that, there has to be something real in them. That kind of empathy had to count for something. So I stayed.

He had his own business, a working-class, blue-collar kind of thing. We didn’t mix professionally I had my career, he had his lane but I helped in small ways. Introductions, ideas, access. I’m a connector. I don’t even think of it as “helping.” It’s just what I do.

But the care didn’t go both ways. Every morning, he’d make himself breakfast—eggs, potatoes, the works. And he’d never once offer me any. I told him it hurt. I told him food was a love language for me. He never changed. Just… kept eating.

He once told me I was “more sophisticated” than him. I used to hear that as affection. Now I hear it as retreat. As an excuse not to try. Like I was the one who had to adjust because I was better equipped.

I don’t have a huge circle of close friends. I’m intense. I notice things other people don’t. I name patterns. I say the quiet parts out loud. That doesn’t always land well. Mark once thanked one of my friends for being there for me … said I didn’t have many. He wasn’t wrong.

Eventually, we broke up. It wasn’t dramatic. It just… ended. Now I’m dating again. Men talk about therapy, emotional availability, shadow work. But then they flinch the moment something gets real.

1jvrbcv,Let’s talk about self-sabotage—what it really looks like and how we break free,"I’ve been reading The Mountain Is You by Brianna Wiest, and it’s opened my eyes in so many ways—especially about self-sabotage.
She says something powerful:

> “There is no such thing as self-sabotage. What you call self-sabotage is simply two conflicting desires—one conscious, one unconscious.”



That really hit me.
We all want growth, healing, love, and success—but at the same time, we carry inner blocks we don’t even recognize.
It’s not that we’re broken. It’s that parts of us are afraid, trying to protect us in the only way they know how.

So what does self-sabotage look like in real life?
It’s more subtle than we think:

Resistance

Procrastination

Hitting your “upper limit”

Justifying inaction

Perfectionism

Feeling guilty for succeeding

Fear of failing

Always being “busy”

Spending time with people who drain you

Downplaying your growth

Attachment to what you don’t even want anymore

Judging others to avoid looking inward

Overthinking, disorganization, avoidance


Sometimes, we don’t even realize we’re in a self-sabotage cycle. But there are signs:

You know what you don’t want more than what you do.

You spend time proving you’re “okay” instead of being okay.

You put your head in the sand and avoid your emotions.

You prioritize being liked over being happy.

You chase goals without asking why you want them.

You doubt yourself more than you believe in yourself.

You wait for external approval instead of creating your own life.


And here’s the hard truth:
Healing isn’t just about knowing what to do—it’s about doing it even when it’s uncomfortable.
You will feel resistance, shame, guilt, even disgust as you let go of old patterns. That’s normal. It’s part of the climb.

To break out of the cycle:

Identify your subconscious commitments—what is your inner fear trying to protect?

Ask yourself:

Why am I feeling this?

What is this emotion trying to teach me?

What do I need in this moment?


Use logic and vision to guide action instead of waiting for motivation.

Reconnect to your why.

Give yourself space to feel without judgment.


Let’s open this up:

What does self-sabotage look like for you?
Have you caught yourself in the cycle lately?
What’s one habit or mindset you’re working on shifting?

Let’s help each other climb the mountain within.

1jvp8j4,How can I be more emotional intelligent in a “recovering” relationship?,"

I realised only recently that I have been emotionally distant from my partner of over 3 years and she asked for a breakup last month. I didn’t allow her to be vulnerable in the uncertainty of our future as I don’t want to lose her. Only during the reconciliation, I realised that she wanted to mitigate our future uncertainties, basically doing whatever we can to not lose each other. But I was closed off thinking that she wanted to leave. For 6 months she had to endure me closing up like this. 

Now that we are still together, although things are still in limbo (no pet names, no sex, extremely slow), I’ve started therapy to learn more about emotions and communication so that I wouldn’t hurt myself or her further as I really want to give this relationship a fresh chance. I kinda feel like she is a FA/DA right now due to the heightened guard that built up from before the breakup and during it. I became anxious in the process. I love her so much and just want to be someone she can rely on again. How can I better understand emotions? Such that when she is stress at work (she is in fact, EXTREMELY stressed out at work), I know how to be there for her without providing any advice (I have the tendency of speaking too much to the point where I advice subconsciously), and giving her sufficient space when she needs. She tend to distant herself at certain times of the day and I start to feel anxious. 

Are there any books or podcasts that talk about such emotions? Sorry for asking on this sub. I have been focusing a lot on aligning emotions and understanding them as I wasn’t like this before. It’s all new to me.

Edit: thank you for all the responses. I really appreciate that everyone is typing long replies to this post. I definitely do love my girlfriend a lot. There is not codependency or anything. She is the light of my life and my princess on both the good and the bad days. She deserves the best and I want to try my best to be the best for her even if I only have 1 percent success rate to save our relationship. Thank you for doing what you can to help me.

1jvg5fx,Limerence or love?,"I've had an online long distance relationship with an ISTP fearful avoidant for over a year. We text daily and the indirect nature of the relationship being just texting allows him to open up and express his emotions more than he ever would in person. After six months, I met him and stayed at his house for 5 nights for a magical intimate time. We continue to text long messages to each other daily. I will be visiting him again for a week this summer. 

Sometimes i feel i am mildly limeric in this relationship with him. 
1. I obsess about him all day long. Not about what i can do to make him like me. I think about what he might be doing, how i want to be with him in the same space together, how he might be feeling, wondering what he's thinking about. 
2. I also wonder how much he likes me and im uncertain how our relationship is going. He doesnt say im beautiful or hot but has called me cute. He doesnt send me pictures of himself cause he thinks he's not attractive. He says he wants me always in his life and he never wants to have a break where we dont talk (however he is currently taking a week break from me because he is busy with his kids during spring break and i text him long messages that is probably making him feel suffercating). However, I dont get the feeling that he desires me. Which i think is a typical feeling when dating a fearful avoidant. 
3. I daydream about one day possibly us living in the same town and what that might be like to actually date him in-person. I get the feeling that it would be very different and maybe things wouldn't work out because i'd probably get the feeling that he's not that into me since he likely won't make a move on me. But i can also imagine us really hitting it off and having a long fun relationship together. 
4. There's a part of me that thinks this relationship is unrealistic and not compatible (since i dont feel desired) but i highly enjoy talking with him and sharing deep thoughts and feelings together. There are traits of his that i dislike - sometimes shows a lack of empathy in that he thinks people should be able to understand things as quickly as he can or do things as efficiently as he can. A lack of moral character. A lack of openness. A lack of self esteem. A lack of accountability. Tendency to be defensive and turn the tables whenever he feels he's been criticized. These are all bad traits of his. Yet, I cant get myself to walk away from him because i miss our chats together. He is going through a really difficult depressive time in his life and he likes having my support, someone to talk to, but also likes talking about sexual things as well. His biggest fear is being alone in life and i wonder if he's just with me cause he doesn't want to be alone, not cause he really enjoys my company. Deep down he fears he's not good enough and that partners will leave him because of it. Sometimes what i feel we have is a FWB but im not sure. He says he's never felt safe in his life and i'm the person he feels most safe with. As a fearful avoidant, he is not one to want to put a name to the relationship. 

What do you think this is?

1jv9bb8,Healing is an endless journey—how has it changed you?,"I think healing is an endless journey. It’s not linear, not always gentle—and definitely not always pretty.
But it is freeing.

One of the lesser-talked-about stages of healing is disgust. Yes, disgust.
You might suddenly feel embarrassed about the people you once begged for love, the energy you gave to the wrong places, or the patterns you once called “normal.”
And that’s okay.

That feeling—what you’re informally calling disgust—is actually a sign of growth.
Psychologists call it cognitive-emotional differentiation or post-traumatic insight.
It’s when you begin to emotionally detach from past versions of yourself, reassess past relationships, and realize how far you've come.

It’s not regression. It’s clarity.
Your body, mind, and soul are finally saying: “That will never be me again.”

And sure, it stings—but it’s also a sign of freedom.
That version of you was survival. This one? This one is awakened, boundaried, and untouchable.

So, let me ask the community:
How has healing changed you?
What have you learned about yourself that you never expected?
Have you reached that stage of disgust… and did it help you break free?

Let’s talk. Let’s share. Let’s normalize every phase of the journey.

I fell for him because we seemed to me incredibly emotionally mature as for his age and comparing to men my age. He was very affectionate, caring and gave me huge feeling of being safe. He expressed his affection love and plans for the future together. We both empaths and im extravert he is very inteovert tho. Although he is super attractive he doesnt chase girls, been to two sotuationships before me, got dumped in first, second was abusive from drug addicted gf and so he left. He said im his forst live and he never felt better with any woman. He is very close with his siblings and parents, feel responsible for them and always there to help them. Hard working and responsible. He isnt very sociable, have 3 male friends from childhood and some peers from work. He loves his work and is very dedicated to it. Seriously, there were no red flags with him, although it took me longer to express that i love him, i was cautious throug to me previous bad situationships (I had two great serious relationships with wonderful men too that im very gratefull for and we still friends). I also have been 3 years in therapy, which gave me greeat tool into my strong and weak points, my patterns and signs of people trying to take advantage of me or being manipulative. Plus knowing both sides of possible relations I thought of myself I can pretty soon recognize good from wrong. The moment in my life when I met him I was happy, satisfied on being single for some years and didnt pursue relationships, but yeah was dating feol time to time not geting serious about that, so was it with him at first, but he just been so great guy i fell in love. He expressed his feelings very early to me, so was with asking for commitment, which was a bot too early for me but i told him that i had experiences that just made me more cautious and i need time to tell him same. He was very understanding and told me i can take as much time as i need. I ultimately did. And was telling him that since then. He wanted me to come and meet his parents, we planned to go on vacation in my country in April, were talking about moving in together this year. 

HARD TIME, CONFUSION, BREAKUP

We Never argued except for one time when Ive been really low and told him I dont feel loved enough in this relationship enough to change my country (I had depression and felt overwhelmed a bit scared with heading to deal alone with decision to leave it all and move to another country). He knew things going on in my life, we were on phone every day and it felt like i can tell him all (he was often encouraging me to do so). My health worsen - I found out my cancer is back and im gonna need to go throu chemo again, I had my big finals coming, had some problems woth not being able to fully commit at work, I felt bad not seeing him, and ultimately started to see things dark, became very incecure and it felt like forst symptoms of depression were showing up. Couldnt treat it at the same time as fighting cancer. Well he knew it all. Althougg we phoned everyday I somehow felt he is distancing himself. He didnt ask for videophones like before, slowed down with expressing his vision of us both together as he used to, he wasnt share his inner world with me and ask me questions about mine. Like he was with me sending goodmorning goodnight calling but his soul was detaching. I asked few times how he feels about relationship, if i can improve anything or do smth to make him happier. He was always saying he feels the same for me, he is happy in love and theres nothing more i can do. Either because of my mental state or my intuition voice it didnt convince me and I was becoming more and more insecure. Was fighting it inside never let it affect us. I knew I may not see things completely as they are. Or maybe i didnt want to see?

We never argued, never jelous, manipulative or toxic. At least i didnt see any signs for that. But there came a day. It was my only time when i let the insecurieties win with me and had outburst in text to him. He wrote its better we broke up for us, that we are incompatibile with love language and wi will never make it. Later on that day we called and both cried and fell asleep on phone together. The next day I wrote him two long letters of apology explaining my weakness and that I didnt mean it. I asked him for understanding (reminded smth he alreadyknew its been a lot of shit going on like my returned cancer treatment, my finals, stress and big life decision about changing the country). Told him that I love him like always and addmited how badly i hurt him and ask to forgive me. He maintained his opinion bout going separate ways is best for us (not giving much more explanation to that). I was confused he gives up so easily while we were about to start living together and have family plus me moving to him. But I decided not to push with questions as he still hurt because of my words from the day before. He then wrote me if Im whenever in his country i shall let him know and we can meet as friends. I wrote him that i love him very much and accept his decision and wish him the best and also that whenever he needs me im gonna be for him. 

He wrote “I love you very much too but I cant come and visit you anymore I need time to think and really understand everything I feel. For now it's best if we take a little break and focus on ourselves”. 
Tbh thats the part when I got confused if its a goodbye forever put in soft way or does he really need time to process situation (about being hurt by me? About me moving in? About us together?) i only wrote him thats ok baby i understand it and thanked him for all the love and beautiful moments together and that it was an honour to share life with him for a bit. Wished him best and wrote goodbye. He wrote “You too hope the very best for you”The next (3) day was his birthday, he received the gift I sent him earlier and texted me in the morning “Thank you very much for the flowers my love ❤️”. 

Thats it. Its been two weeks now since that. I could get over him but I need to be sure first its really over. I dont know what are his real emotions and is he def over.

1jv2mrg,Is this emotional immaturity?,"I'm confused about my husband's reaction from yesterday, and I would like some advice/opinion on what might be happening and what it is I can maybe do to help him going forward.

I had a really sh*tty day yesterday at work, and when I got off (about 4:30 p.m.), I called my husband because I wanted to hear his voice and maybe a few words of encouragement to help me settle a bit.
He told me that he was just about to leave from work and we could talk about this at home in a few minutes.

When he got home, I thought we would hug/talk about the issue/talk about something else that is fun, really I would have liked anything. But he came home, didn't even mention the phone call and started to complain about his own work and how tired he was. I felt hurt, but I thought he might have just needed to vent before he could hear me. So I listened and was empathetic. Once he was done talking, he still did not mention the phone call, so I decided to just start the topic myself. While I was telling him the story, he didn't even look at me and when I got to the end, he didn't say anything. Complete silence for about 10 sec, and then he just switched to another completely unrelated subject, he skipped over my story.

I debated if I should say something about it because me being hurt by something usually ends in a fight. But I couldn't just let it go either, so I told him that his silence makes me feel unimportant and lonely, and asked if he could say something in the future in these situations because this doesn't feel good to me.
He went into a rant about how I call him at least once a month at work when I feel bad and how annoying this is, that I demand that he feels the same sh*tty feelings that I feel and accused me of wanting to make him feel bad too, because I don't want to feel bad on my own.
I explained to him that all I wanted was encouragement or some emotional support, that I don't have bad intentions.
He replied that he was too tired to take in my story and that he has no energy to support me. Why can't I just leave him alone, why do I have to demand more of him?

He has been stressed and tired for the last 4 years. He usually tells me that things will get better once this project is done/once he finds a new job/once he gets a raise. But it never does get better, and I have been trying my best to be there for him, but I can't anymore, I'm too exhausted. I want to be stressed and tired and sad sometimes, too.

What do you guys see? Is this emotional immaturity? Or is he burnt out?
Or is he like this so that he doesn't have to lift a finger?

Edit: We've been together for 4 years, so he has been stressed and tired ever since I've known him, but for about two years into our relationship he was able to be supportive.",GlitteryAngelWings,5,15,No Flair,emotional immaturity im confused husband reaction yesterday would like adviceopinion might happening maybe help going forward really shtty day yesterday work got pm called husband wanted hear voice maybe word encouragement help settle bit told leave work could talk home minute got home thought would hugtalk issuetalk something else fun really would liked anything came home didnt even mention phone call started complain work tired felt hurt thought might needed vent could hear listened empathetic done talking still mention phone call decided start topic telling story didnt even look got end didnt say anything complete silence sec switched another completely unrelated subject skipped story debated say something hurt something usually end fight couldnt let go either told silence make feel unimportant lonely asked could say something future situation doesnt feel good went rant call least month work feel bad annoying demand feel shtty feeling feel accused wanting make feel bad dont want feel bad explained wanted encouragement emotional support dont bad intention replied tired take story energy support cant leave alone demand stressed tired last year usually tell thing get better project doneonce find new jobonce get raise never get better trying best cant anymore im exhausted want stressed tired sad sometimes guy see emotional immaturity burnt like doesnt lift finger edit weve together year stressed tired ever since ive known two year relationship able supportive,-0.08237639553429026,0.5597687400318978

1juzn5b,Emotional maturity check-in: What are your relationship dealbreakers?,"To all of us navigating love with self-awareness—what are your real dealbreakers in relationships?

Here’s mine:
When I realized I was being gaslit, manipulated, and made to question my worth. I kept over-explaining, bending over backwards to be enough for someone who wasn’t even being real with me. It wasn’t one big explosion—it was a slow drip of emotional unavailability, dishonesty, and mixed signals that finally woke me up.

I’ve learned to value presence over promises, peace over potential, and truth over charm. Emotional intelligence teaches us that love should not feel like anxiety.

So I ask:
If you’ve ever been in a relationship that made you shrink, doubt, or second guess yourself—what finally made you walk away? What was your dealbreaker?

Let’s share and learn from each other. Your story might be the sign someone else needs.

1juxuim,READ PLEASE! Opinions?!,"How do I describe a feeling? A feeling where your heart drops to the ground, like there is some type of connection. 


A mutual connection. 
Friends, but more in the past. 
I think of what we could have been. 
Sometimes I wondered if you felt what I was feeling. 

We knew each other for awhile, but recently started to hang out. 
Setting up a basement party. 
We forgot something so you decide to go to the store to get the item. 
I joined because you offered. 
It was refreshing, I remember it, we talked and walked and the wind blew just quite and the sun shined correctly. 
I remember the walk back, I thought we were gonna go back to where we came. 
Long hill, but he had a shortcut. 

When I was a kid till I reached Middle school. 
I was a climbing monkey. 
I climbed trees till I couldn’t climb, and did rock climbing. 

And the short cut was a little hill in the woods. 
And I haven't done anything like that since middle school and it just brought back
happy memories. 
And it was with him and I never thought of it. 
It was like a pause in my life. 
An awaken.
But never really thought of it because it wasn’t important 

I got invited to his parties

He dressed up as a penis for halloween which was hilarious.
We talked, I don’t remember what the conversation was but it was like a check in. 
“How you been, you’ve been okay.” 
Eye contact and silence. 
It felt like our eyes and our moment did the talking? 

I watched a movie recently called Past Lives, so that’s why I’m writing. 
Really good movie. 

I got invited to his graduation party. 
Our last conversation together: 

It was a simple conversation. 
Hi, hello, how are you? 
But it was our last goodbye, of course we would align paths again because we share mutals contacts.
But these mere moments we had felt special, felt right. 

I remember telling him I would read one of his writings or show him one of mine, we would hang more. 

I wanted our conversation to go on for so long
I wanted him to speak to me 
I wanted to know him 
I wanted him to know me 
I wanted him to connect with me? 
I didn’t want the night to end
I didn;t want his gf to come and disturb our conversation like she always did. 
I wanted more time. 

There wasn't. 


I would've told him these feelings. 
But we moved on from life. 

And even though  I didn’t like her, I didn’t want to make things awkward between me and her. 
Or ruin a chance? 

Of what me and him didn't have. 


I could still tell him but what’s the point?

Right?

I was having a tough time with my partner, and honestly, I was at a loss for how to express myself without sounding robotic or completely losing it. Out of curiosity (and maybe a bit of desperation), I decided to ask ChatGPT for help in “writing a message to end a relationship in a kind and respectful way.”

What it produced was almost poetic. Seriously… it was emotionally insightful, sensitive, and even showed empathy. I made a few adjustments, but the foundation was strong. My now-ex even thanked me for being clear and honest.

Now I’m left wondering—if AI can manage delicate conversations like that, how long until we start relying on it for all our tough emotional talks? Is that a smart move… or are we sacrificing our humanity?

1juqaqd,Is it me? (Break up),"My ex-boyfriend (36M) and I (32F) broke up yesterday after 2 years of dating. He hadn't had a girlfriend for 11 years, and I have been in a couple of serious relationships. During one difficult relationship, I studied healthy communication and practiced it religiously for years. I expressed to my recent ex (36M) that communication and emotional intelligence are my biggest priorities and those would be deal breakers.  
I started noticing he would react to my emotions like a teenager being told to clean their room, and he would hardly let me speak about my feelings on any matter if it was something other than ""fun"". In 2024 I mentioned that I felt like this area needed to be addressed, and it's what I need in a relationship to feel emotionally secure. He became angry with this boundary and broke up with me. He came back a month later saying now that he's calmed down he can see how this is a valid request and he will work on it as long as I am patient with him.  
Fast forward from the conversation in 2024 to a couple days ago, there was continuous lack of emotional awareness. I continued to be patient and would express that his actions make me feel like a burden and unheard, but it seemly fell on deaf ears. So I brought the topic up (seriously) again, and was met with immediate deflection. He also said that men are not emotionally aware (and if they are they would cheat on me), and that me asking if we can work on it together means I never appreciated anything he's ever done for me… despite all the verbal and physical appreciation I've shown.  
I asked if we could think of solutions on how we can handle this issue together in the future, gave him a couple of ideas, but he said that *he* is the problem and his solution was to break up because he will never be enough.  (I've never said that or shown that, spent hours explaining that is not the case, I only wanted to grow together on this).  
I love this man a lot. I thought that relationships involve discussions on issues together, and solving them together.

1juns25,"I've got a problem with relationships, could you tell me which direction is worth looking to, to get to know it better or solve it? It's confusing","Well, hi there.
I'm 20M, student. I think and I've been told that I'm kinda attractive and confident, I've got no problem with talking to women, they even hit on me once in a while since I got social lately.
The problem is, when I get close to someone I feel attracted to and like her personality, and it's mutual, we get to that phase when we're touchy maybe even kiss, but then I kind of stop progressing the relationship in any way and I'm not really sure why.
 I like the person, I keep daily contact at least online, I like to be physically around, I think about her during the day, but I'll never get closer, I guess that I may be afraid to get close emotionally?
I stopped feeling the butterfly crush feeling since my last crush like a year ago, I kind of feel it tempting to be by myself.
Maybe it could be because I've always been used to being independent with my problems, emotionally and otherwise, I'd ask for help only when I was done for, but I was dismissed since it was my first time asking so I dealt with it somehow and never brought it up again ever.
I'm bothered by this, because this pattern of behaviour hurts myself, and the other person which also hurts myself, I wanna progress in the relationship, I have the best conditions to do it, but something just blocks me and I go kind of numb, uncaring. For some reason it feels uncomfortable to even partially depend on someone and have someone closer than a best friend.

1juhi64,You’re not just like your parents… you’re living their life (without realizing it),"I think a lot of us are out here unintentionally repeating our parents’ patterns. Like, you catch yourself in a moment and suddenly realize, wait… this feels familiar. And not always in a good way.

Maybe youre super conflict-avoidant like your mom. Or you shut downn emotionally when things get intense, just like your dad did. Or maybe yo attract partners that make you feel the same way you felt growing up, unseen, unsafe, like you had to earn love by being useful. We don’t even notice it most of the time. We just call it “our personality” or “this is just how I am.”

But if you look closely, a lot of those patterns are actually borrowed. And here’s the tricky part: the more familiar something feels, the more we tend to trust it..even if iit’s dysfunctional. The chaos might not feel good, but it feels known, and the nervous system clings to that.

It’s not about blaming parents, by the way..most of them were doing the best they could with what they had. But if you never pause to look at these patterns, you risk spending your whole life playing out someone else’s unresolved story.

That’s honestly why I put together my Personality Model Workbook. It’s designed to help you recognize these inherited patterns and how they tie into your current behavior,especially through the lens of the Big Five personality model. TThere are self-reflection prompts, writing exercises, and tools to help you trace where these things came from and how to actually start changing them.

1jugd20,How Does Your Partner or Close Friend Support You Emotionally?,"Hey everyone,

Lately, I’ve been reflecting on how powerful it is to have someone in your life—be it a partner or a close friend—who speaks life into you. In a world full of fake smiles and silent battles, that kind of support is truly rare.

Not just someone who celebrates your highs, but someone who:

Lifts you when you're crawling,

Corrects you with care, not criticism,

Reminds you who you are when you forget,

And feeds your soul—not just your ego.


True connection is knowing someone sees strength in you even when you can’t see it yourself. That kind of emotional support can shift everything.

How does your person (or people) show up for you emotionally?
Do you feel seen, held, reminded of your worth? Or has it made you realize how often emotional support is taken for granted?

Let’s talk about it. What does real support look like to you?

Someone’s single? “Yeah, makes sense. You’re so beautiful it’s intimidating. No one’s brave enough to talk to you.”

1jufjjt,Just learned I have inattentive ADHD,"ADHD, I never considered getting tested because I was never really hyperactive as a kid. I thought it wasn't worth getting tested because I can function quite well. My doctor said it's because I have established conscious and subconscious systems

* I can't follow instructions in order whether it's a recipe, building furniture, work, GPS, I still make it to the end goal and deadlines are met but it's very disorganized and I stress myself out easily. As she put it, messy but functional. It helps to have someone else read out the directions or visual learning
* I forgot where everything is. I bought trackers for keys/wallet/phone. My room has to be messy to feel organized. Yet, I remember the tinniest details about people and events.
* I am very good at multitasking while overwhelming myself but still meeting all goals and deadlines
* I have a lot of energy yet have never had trouble sleeping. I need stimulation throughout the day otherwise I have my knee bouncing. I run because it's enough stimulus being outside, seeing people, seeing my surroundings. I have a chronic need for movement
* Most repetitive things I do not like but if it has a deadline or urgent it becomes a game for me. How fast can I label 800 bottles, repair 30 of the same thing?
* For things that are exciting, challenging, curious I tend to say ""yes"" very often, not to people please but because I get a dopamine spike. I find what they ask me to be mentally stimulating, productive
* Always listening to music, sitting in silence can be frustrating
* I pull my ears a lot. It’s a weird tick for when I’m stressed or confused but also when I want to leave a social event. One of my exes would watch when I pulled my ears to know when I'd like to leave.

I decided to get tested because over the last year or so and one relationship, I realized I crave calmness in my relationships. I can be chaotic, messy, all over the place, and stressed out but in romantic relationships, I thrive the most when they're calm, fun, consistent, great conflict management where both peoples feelings are heard, and communication. I have a lot of feelings. Someone who balances me out and I can sit still with and relax. I am not clingy and value independence. I'm very observant and notice the little things about people.

With regard to emotional intelligence,

* I am able to reflect, change, and am self aware of my own patterns
* I am overly empathetic at times, heightened empathy, I can put myself in other peoples shoes easily
* I have a great friend circle that I share my personal life with easily, relationships, struggles, stress with. I'm very much an open book when I am comfortable. I look out for the people I care about.
* I can easily occupy myself and have hobbies that serve specific purposes: running to clear my mind and for stimulus, listen to lots of music, baking very badly, guitar, cafe hopping, reading the physical newspaper
* Sometimes I can get stuck on something because I really like to understand situations and people and then I don't know how to stop learning even if it's bad for me.

Working on

* I'm getting better at communicating in the moment but I do prefer to have time and not make rash decisions or assume anything. I don't need arguments to be settled immediately and I don't like arguments for argument's sake.
* I'm also getting better at offering reassurance. I grew up with non verbal affection and love. Acts of kindness, gifts, quality time as a family. Rarely if ever has my family said I love you to each other. So, verbal affirmations can feel forced or sometimes unnecessary in my brain. But, I know for many people verbal affirmations are important and can quickly ease insecurities or overthinking.

In the corporate world, I've realized that shyness can definitely be a problem because it holds you back from moving up or stepping into leadership roles.

To be honest, I'm not super shy, but I'd say I'm shy enough that it gets in the way of my career. Small talk with coworkers makes me uncomfortable, and I usually only feel at ease when the conversation is strictly about work.

But I know that building connections is key if I want to grow - both in my current job and anywhere else. Being communicative is just as important as having strong hard skills.

One thing that makes it harder is that I work remotely. It's way more challenging to build connections with coworkers when all your interactions are virtual, but I really enjoy working this way and have been doing it for over two years now, so I really need to learn how to strengthen bonds with my coworkers in this virtual setting.

1ju9c5r,Been stuck in a 5-year on-and-off relationship with a fearful avoidant. She ghosted me again—after promising to meet. I need tools to let go.,"Hi everyone,  
I’m (35M) coming out of yet another emotional spiral triggered by the same person—someone I’ve had a 5-year, on-and-off dynamic with. I have an anxious attachment style; she seems to lean fearful avoidant. It’s been a brutal cycle of closeness, withdrawal, promises, and disappointment.

Over the years, we’ve had moments of real connection. But also betrayals, unfaithfulness (even while we were supposedly exclusive), and emotional distance that never really healed. Despite all this, I kept showing up—maybe out of love, maybe out of unresolved wounds, or both. I supported her emotionally, logistically, and financially at times. Not to “buy” her, but because I genuinely cared and wanted her to feel safe.

Recently, we were both visiting our hometown (we live in the same city now). She told me she wanted to see me, picked out a gift which I got her, and we agreed to meet. I stayed longer, hoping to reconnect—at least to talk. But when the moment came… silence.

I reached out. No response. Tried again the next day—she replied coldly, said she was “in her own stuff” and hadn’t really thought about it. That triggered my anxious response, and I tried (too hard) to fix things. She said we’d talk later and still see each other. Then again… nothing. No cancellation. No goodbye. Just ghosting.

I sent a couple of respectful messages asking if we could talk, or at least say goodbye properly. I even offered her an out—told her that if she wanted us to go our separate ways, I would understand. I just didn’t want to be left in silence. She listened to my voice note. She read every message. But said nothing.

The silence isn’t new—but it hits harder this time. Maybe because I wasn’t asking for anything she hadn’t already promised. Maybe because I stayed hopeful when I should’ve known better. And once again, I find myself questioning if I’m “too much” for simply wanting clarity, kindness, or closure.

I know I may have come off as intense. I was trying to self-soothe, trying to reach for what little safety I thought we still had. But I didn’t lie, ghost, or disappear. I showed up—imperfectly, yes, but with sincerity.

She hasn’t blocked me. She hasn’t said “stop.” But she also hasn’t said anything. And that silence has been louder than any fight we ever had.

How do you let go of someone who leaves the door open, only to vanish when you walk through it?  
How do you stop chasing the version of them that only appears in rare, intoxicating glimpses?

I’m not writing this to be consoled—I’m writing because I want to grow.  
If you’ve loved someone with a fearful avoidant pattern while carrying an anxious one…  
How did you finally let go? How did you heal?

1ju88a6,"I’m a Dismissive Avoidant, and this is what confrontation feels like with someone I deeply care about.","Confrontation doesn’t scare me because I’m afraid of you… it scares me because I’m afraid I won’t be able to make you understand me. And when it’s you someone I care about deeply that fear multiplies.

It’s draining. Not because I don’t want to work things out, but because every time I try to speak, it feels like the words will come out wrong. I want to explain what’s going on inside me, but I feel like you’ll take it the wrong way… like you’ll think I’m cold, or dismissive, or that I don’t get you.

But I do. I understand you. I feel your emotions deeply, sometimes too deeply… and I want to respond in a way that makes you feel safe. But when the moment comes, my brain short-circuits. What I want to say never matches what I actually say. So I go quiet. I shut down. I nod along. I agree, not because I don’t have anything to say, but because everything feels too much.

I’m not trying to avoid you… I’m trying to avoid the shame that comes up when I realize I’m failing you emotionally. I don’t want to invalidate your pain. I just don’t know how to meet it in a way that doesn’t make you feel like I’m disappearing. There’s so much going on in my head… so many thoughts I want to explain, layers I want to unpack, reasons I want to give. But every attempt feels like it might come out wrong… or worse, hurt you more. So I say nothing.

And I hate that.
Because I want to stay.
I want to make things right.
I just don’t know how to do it without drowning.

I shut down not because I don’t love you… but because my nervous system goes back to that scared version of me. The one that learned it’s safer to be quiet than to be misunderstood. I retreat, not because I don’t care, but because I care too much and feel unequipped to show it. You deserve clarity, and I give you silence not because I want to hurt you, but because silence is the only thing that doesn’t feel like a threat when I’m overwhelmed.

I care about you, too deeply this is why It’s even worse. Because the guilt is heavier. The shame runs deeper. The silence feels colder. And I know I’m the one who brought it in. If I could explain it in the moment, I would. But most of the time, I only find the words once you’re already gone.

To anyone who’s been on the other side of this… I’m sorry. We don’t shut down to punish you. We shut down because deep down, we feel like we’ve already failed you. We return to that inner child who just wants to hide under the table again. Who doesn’t want to be seen not because we don’t want connection but because we’re scared it will slip through our fingers the moment we open up. 

We are not victims of the world… we are just cowards.

The truth is, we chose our darkness because it was easier. Choosing you would have meant facing our fear, and we weren’t ready. We weren’t brave enough. And no, we weren’t worthy of your love. Not because you said so, but because we let the darkness pull us in. The same darkness we kept calling solitude. We mistook silence for strength. We mistook distance for peace. And we convinced ourselves we were safer alone. But the truth is, we were just hiding from the kind of love that required us to show up.

It made me realize I was trying to base my worth depending on how this person would treat me. I didn’t want them, I wanted the validation that I was worth paying attention to. It didn’t matter who he was. It wasn’t surprising, I was the quiet kid in the back of class, always observing and drawing in my little sketchbook.

You start going the gym, building some muscle, improving your confidence, reading books and learning new concepts. In retrospect, everything starts to go quite well for you.

But what I wanted to talk about today is where do you draw the line between self-improvement and self-detriment?

Self-improvement should be an act of liberation, but often times I find myself being constrained to it far more. 

The classic rules of no video games, no social media, no junk food are all cemented in most of self-improvement culture. Now you start to dive deeper into the more ""autist"" level of optimization, which is getting 30 minutes of sunlight, taking cold showers, not touching plastics, etc. 

The question is that what if the effort to add/subtract things into your life is your unconscious attempt to mask the internal aspects that you can't stand to accept?

How would an ordinary person look at self-improvement? Even though the self-improvement autists claim that they are better than this person, in the end they still fall short because they have to over rely on these habits to feel secure in themselves.

That's what I mean when ignorance can be truly bliss at times. I'm not saying that these self-improvement habits are inherently bad nor that I'm saying that you are considered a ""loser"" if you don't do them. Sometimes you need a level of ignorance when it comes to self-improvement. Because let's be honest, if we were to optimize everything in our life, we would go insane from that pursuit to excellence. 

Sometimes, it's better to just accept some things as it is and to stop overoptimizing on every single aspect that needs optimizing. In an effort to gain something more, we unwillingly sacrifice something in return. 

Whether it is your insecurity, your constant need for approval, or your lack of pride in your own self. The best form of self-improvement is when you are quote ""free"" from the aspects of life that constrain you from living to your fullest.

1ju74h2,How Do You Respond When Someone Calls You In with Love?,"One of the clearest ways to see someone’s emotional intelligence is by how they respond when you gently bring something up that hurt you.

Not from a place of blame—but from a sincere desire to be heard, understood, and to grow together.

Some people shut down. Others lash out, withdraw, or rewrite the story to make your truth seem like a threat. And sometimes, even when you've held their past and pain with care, they vanish when it's your turn to be held.

It’s wild how the performance drops the moment accountability enters the room.

Emotional intelligence isn’t proven in how we show up when we feel seen. It’s shown in how we act when someone else needs to be seen—especially when their honesty touches a nerve.

That’s where the ego either gets loud… or stays soft.
Where we either defend… or lean in.
Where we say, “I hear you. Let me sit with that.”

So here’s a quiet invitation:
How do you respond when someone calls you in—not out—but in?
When it’s not an attack, but a mirror?

Let’s talk about it.
This community is about growth, honesty, and emotional maturity—and I’m curious to hear your thoughts.

1ju5fnt,Emotional Intelligence ; Where You At?,"Sorry for the long post, I'm mostly here to vent. As the story goes around here, I have/had emotionally absent parents. My mom usually only expresses her emotions when she's angry and does so by yelling and such. I hate to say it, she did all the parenting though. My dad, may he rest in peace, was a kind and gentle soul. A man of little words, was how they described him. He did not express emotions at all. I can remember two times that I got a hug from him, and an I love you was said when I was in the hospital. I don't blame them completely, this was generations in the making on both of their parts. I didn't realize until I started dating how much I yearned to be loved and appreciated. I will say, a good majority of my ""dating"" and deep friendships came from online. I was a fat, insecure kid who lived in a small town so there weren't many options. Not to toot my own horn, but I guess I at least had a decent personality because I could talk my way into a boys heart like no tomorrow. Still can. Lol \^.\^ I found myself obsessed with the attention and constantly wanting it. All of my relationships (except one) has ended because when the honey moon phase ends, and they aren't spending every second talking to me or giving me attention, my mind tells me they must be tired of me, cheating on me, or about to leave me. Usually I try to run myself and either they stop me, I stop myself, or they let me. I always, and I do mean always, ending up hurting them and myself in the long run. 

  
My current relationship has, of course, at the ripe age of three weeks old, taken the turn down turmoil road thanks to this girl. My current mans isn't the put up with this shit type, which why should he be? He has done nothing but reassure and praise me since we started dating and here I am, a weekend of less than quick responses, and I tried to break up with him because ""it feels different"", when actually I'm just not getting constant attention. I'm 27 years old and I genuinely feel like I'm 16 again. That's how emotionally unintelligent I am. I am trying to get back into therapy and have some other things lined up.

1ju1gd7,Question for anyone who can analyze this,"In fourth grade, I was stalked by a classmate. I know this sounds like an exaggeration. We are both females, but I really want your opinions on what could’ve explained her behavior. I’ll put bullet points of things she did in order to keep this concise and make it easier to read (less creepy to most creepy):
-met through a mutual friend in the same class, initially was jealous said friend was hanging out with me more
- would ask where I got my clothes and show up with the exact same thing the next day (lived in a small town with no mall, so traveled at least 30 mins to do this)
-my mom is good at doing my hair and did it in intricate ways in the mornings, she’d make her mom learn this and show up with the same thing the next day 
-always wanted to talk to me/sit near me (normal, but I was more of an antisocial kid and didnt have the social cues to even be fake nice)
-would follow my friend and I around at lunch until we sat down so she could sit with us 
^she said to me “I’m just gonna keep following you,” TEACHER got creeped out, let my best friend and I go to the bathroom before lunch so she’d sit down first
-I didn’t want to swing with her one day, so she yelled at me threatening to off herself (I didn’t know the concept of doing that until she said it)
-when I didn’t want her to cut in front of others to be with me, I physically blocked her, later apologized and explained I was uptight because of my newborn cousin being in the PICU, she told me she hoped my cousin would die 
Overall weird behavior. Seventh grade I tried to give her a second chance but she yelled at me in front of the class because I couldn’t get her tickets to my football game due to COVID (see a pattern?) 
Anyway, just wanted to know what kind of underlying issues were there. I know I probably didn’t handle it correctly since I was 9, but as a psych major now I wanted to see your thoughts

I moved to the U.S. from Europe. I came here full of hope, ambition, and a heart wide open. I started my own video production company, and I work hard every day to create something meaningful. I write books, lyrics, scripts — not because it’s trendy, but because it’s the only way I know how to survive in this world. Art is my therapy, my rebellion, and my truth.But even with all that, I feel alone. Deeply alone.
Not because I can’t be around people, but because I can’t seem to find someone who truly sees me.
When I try to meet women here, there’s always this invisible wall. Like the moment they hear my accent or realize I’m not from here, I stop being a person and become a “risk.”
Like maybe I just want documents or a shortcut.
But I don’t. I’m not here to use anyone.I just want love. Something simple, something raw and real. Someone to sit on the floor with and talk about dreams. Someone who can laugh with me at midnight or hold me when the silence gets too loud.I’m not rich. I’m not perfect. But I’m genuine.
I don’t care where you’re from or what you’ve been through — if you’ve got a good heart, that’s all I care about.Maybe posting this is stupid. Maybe it’s desperate. But I’m tired of pretending I’m okay when I’m not.
So here it is — raw and unfiltered: I want to love and be loved. Not for my passport. Not for my work. But just for being me.

1jtyhil,Help? Trying to love myself...,"This pain still feels unmanageable at times.
The loss of everything I ever wanted—everything I thought I had for a while—still hits hard. I’m doing the work, trying to heal, asking myself: “What makes me happy?” Not just as a father. Not just as a partner. But me—outside of her, outside of anyone else.
It’s hard to admit that chasing happiness through someone else—through making them happy—wasn’t healthy. Realizing I may have been used until I wasn’t needed anymore... that hurts in a way I can’t explain. Accepting that it’s over doesn’t make the pain vanish. It doesn’t silence the negative thoughts. Trying to change those thoughts feels like pushing a boulder uphill every single day.
I’m hurting.
Day in, day out.
And losing access to my kids on top of it—it breaks me in ways I didn’t know I could break.
Why does nothing seem to bring me joy but the idea of a family? A spouse?
Why have I tied my entire sense of self to people who never saw me, appreciated me, or believed in me the way I believed in them?
Why is this world so cruel?
I feel like a character out of a tragedy. I never imagined the person I chose to build a life with would abandon me. I loved her. Unconditionally. With everything I had.
And yet—
Part of healing is forgiveness. And I do forgive.
Part of healing is trying to see myself the way others do… or even better. Learning to appreciate my flaws and my strengths. It sounds so simple—but it’s not, not for me.
Another part of healing is facing the truth: maybe I was the one who let the dream die, even while I was working so hard to keep it alive. I got lost in it. I forgot who I was. I forgot what I wanted. I forgot how to love myself. And now I’m here asking—how do I start to fix that? How do I even begin to learn self-love, when looking back, I don’t think I ever truly had it?
That lack of love for myself led me to someone who never loved me either—despite two children, and everything we shared.
How does a man even begin to change something that deep?
There’s still a lack of motivation to do the healing work. I can’t see joy or happiness beyond my kids. And while they are enough to live for, provide for, and raise into incredible people…
why does it feel impossible to find what makes me happy, outside of loving someone else?
She once told me she didn’t think I truly loved her—that she could be replaced by any woman. That wasn’t true. But… I can’t lie and say I didn’t place my entire sense of worth in being loved by someone. Maybe she wasn’t completely wrong.
So where do I begin…?

Everyone wishes  
to be the calm one—  
the one who watches  
without flinching,  
without needing to prove,  
without being drawn  
into the fire of the crowd.

We remember,  
somewhere deep in the chest,  
the still place behind our eyes,  
where the world happens  
but does not own us.

That is the one we long to be.  
Not the scrambling ego  
with its armor of names,  
its hunger for applause,  
its trembling at rejection,  
its theater of worthiness  
spun from dust.

The ego says,  
*You must matter, or you will disappear.*  
*You must be better, or you are nothing.*  
*You must be seen, or you are dead.*  
And so we run,  
chase shadows,  
clutch at praise like oxygen,  
or hide from shame like prey.

But the watcher—  
the true one—  
does not run.

It leans back,  
lets the waves rise and fall.  
It knows storms are not permanent,  
and fear is a ghost in the fog.

It says,  
*Let them misunderstand you.*  
*Let them leave.*  
*Let the world whirl.*  
You are still here.  
You are the sky,  
not the weather.

And when we touch that place,  
even for a moment,  
there is no enemy.  
No need to be right.  
No need to be liked.

But what if your emotional intensity isn't a flaw… but a signal?

What if the anxiety, fatigue, tension, or even relationship conflict you carry isn’t random—but rooted in unspoken trauma and emotional suppression?

I just wrote an article about why so many of us were never taught how to feel, how that affects our bodies and relationships, and how we can start to heal. It touches on:

The nervous system’s response to ignored emotions

How trauma hides in the body and daily patterns

The quiet power of emotional boundaries

And what it really means to feel safe again


What if the real danger was never being too emotional—but being taught that feeling at all was dangerous?

1jtt50a,Is it even possible to never be insecure?,"An excerpt from my [newsletter](https://keepupwithkaur.com/all-newsletters/):

I was scrolling through YouTube and came across an interview with an Indian actor.The interviewer asked her, ""Are you ever insecure about your partner?""

She smiled & said, ""Not at all. Even if I don’t like someone, he can still talk to them—as long as we communicate openly.""Fair enough, I thought.

But then came a bigger question.“Have you ever felt insecure in life?”Not just in love—in life. Career, friendships, and family.Her answer? “Never.”

This actor is in her 30s. She has a full-blown career in a field where every move she makes is broken down and overanalysed. 

From her date nights, and dinners with friends and family to appearances after heartbreaks and attires at funerals, everything is the talk of the town.

Has she truly never felt insecure? Not even for a short while?

This got me thinking. Is it even humanly possible for someone to never feel insecure or was she pretending because admitting that a small part of her craves comfort, would make her seem weak?

But the thing is that the ability to be vulnerable shows:

\- You trust your emotions instead of suppressing them;

\- You are resilient and not scared of judgement;

\- You believe that your relationships can handle your truth & will fulfil your needs; and

\- You know when to ask for help.Vulnerability isn’t about being defenceless, over-dependent or seeking validation.

After 6 years of researching and studying the human behaviour of thousands, Brené Brown observed that vulnerable people were living truly “wholesome” [lives.In](http://lives.In) fact, she calls ​vulnerability the birthplace of joy, creativity, belonging and love​. 

To be vulnerable:

1/ Acknowledge discomfort. Start small. 

2/ Use your inner circle. Not everything needs to be shared with everybody. 

3/ Allow yourself to be seen. If you’re invalidating your experiences or undercutting your feelings, it doesn’t count. Be honest.

4/ Accept your imperfections. It’s okay to make mistakes. Don’t take everything too seriously.

5/ Be open to others vulnerabilities.

1jtq3fl,Irritability in relationships?,"TLDR: How does irritability show up in your relationship? How often does it come up? Do you feel like it’s evenly distributed between partners? What feels like a “normal” amount to you?

Context:

I'm (29F) trying to get a clearer sense of what a normal amount of irritability looks like in a healthy relationship. Specifically, I want to understand how often it comes up for others, and what realistic expectations around that might be — especially since I tend to experience it more than my partner.

For context: When irritability comes up with my partner (32M), it's usually acknowledged quickly and taken responsibility for. It's rarely directed at each other, and if it is, there’s an immediate apology. We’re not generally a high-conflict couple, and these moments are relatively short-lived.

That said, I’ve noticed that I tend to be the one who gets snappy or irritable more often. My partner also gets in bad moods, but his usually come through as general frustration and/or withdrawal — not sharpness or tone.

Fwiw I am always working on reducing my irritability and refining my self care to eradicate as much of it as possible, but during this process I need room for some messiness as I grow via therapy, self care and reflection, and via medication attunement and stabilization.


Most common times that it arises in my relationship:

PMS – During that week, I’ll sometimes get defensive or reactive more easily. Example: I asked him defensively if he thought I was irresponsible for having my dog off-leash at a park. I immediately apologized and said I was feeling on edge because of PMS. That week had maybe 3–4 moments like that.

Overstimulated/hungry/tired – Especially in crowded or high-stress environments. Example: Yesterday in a busy airport, I was overstimulated, hungry, and tired. He made a joke about something I said, and I snapped, “Don’t make fun of me.” I apologized right away, saying that’s not how I want to respond, and that I know he wasn’t trying to mock me.

Secondary stress: If there is a debate or some micro tension that arises, I can get stressed that things feel uneasy between us and need to step away for a short window to recalibrate.",robochiggen,20,7,No Flair,irritability relationship tldr irritability show relationship often come feel like evenly distributed partner feel like normal amount context im f trying get clearer sense normal amount irritability look like healthy relationship specifically want understand often come others realistic expectation around might especially since tend experience partner context irritability come partner usually acknowledged quickly taken responsibility rarely directed there immediate apology generally highconflict couple moment relatively shortlived said ive noticed tend one get snappy irritable often partner also get bad mood usually come general frustration andor withdrawal sharpness tone fwiw always working reducing irritability refining self care eradicate much possible process need room messiness grow via therapy self care reflection via medication attunement stabilization common time arises relationship pm week ill sometimes get defensive reactive easily example asked defensively thought irresponsible dog offleash park immediately apologized said feeling edge pm week maybe moment like overstimulatedhungrytired especially crowded highstress environment example yesterday busy airport overstimulated hungry tired made joke something said snapped dont make fun apologized right away saying thats want respond know wasnt trying mock secondary stress debate micro tension arises get stressed thing feel uneasy u need step away short window recalibrate,0.004960317460317473,0.5570436507936508

1jtlx4a,breakup realisations: avoidant exes,"i have been thinking a lot throughout my breakup and have made some groundbreaking realisations for myself. it’s been painful seeing that my ex is doing fine and feels better off without our relationship but i’ve been unnecessarily punching myself in the gut over the fact that they haven’t shown any sign of grieving or caring about the breakup, thinking that it had something to do with me.
 
i realised only moments ago that my ex with a slight avoidant attachment style, is probably unable to feel what i feel and probably coping through avoiding grief, misery, longing, and even love. all these weeks after the breakup i constantly thought to myself “wow, they are so heartless and uncaring, did our relationship really mean nothing to them? am i invaluable and not good enough? maybe they’re not even thinking about me anymore.” 
what i failed to realise sooner was that our relationship issues must have triggered my ex’s avoidance and they were unable to find those ‘love emotions’ for me.

this might still be something they’re struggling with, which could explain why they don’t feel as much of a sense of longing, loss, sadness, fondness, and care for me and what we shared. i know that conflict and personal attacks are some of the things that trigger avoidants the most, our unhealthy relationship brought out unhealed, fearful, survival-mode versions of us when we fought and for my ex, whenever i made them feel uncomfortable/unconfident as well. i could not read their coping mechanism and how they’re processing the breakup because i only know my own triggers and pain but with what i know and have experienced with their avoidant attachment style, this might explain things. 

i get it, how would they be able to care for or miss me when they’re busy protecting themselves from feeling attacked, judged, uncomfortable? maybe it’ll take my ex some time and healing work until they feel ready to acknowledge any pain and the loss of our relationship — if they valued it in the first place, that is. of course there are moments where i have doubts; what did i do to deserve loving someone who doesn’t even love me until the end? i wrote them letters, begged for them back, would have fixed things, told them how much they meant to me, and not a word from them on how they felt about the years we shared. as adults now i do have an expectation of communication and being respected/valued but as someone who loved them so much, can see both our pain, i know finding the voice to be vulnerable one last time after everything went down must have been difficult and unnatural for them. so for that i will find it in myself to forgive them for not being able to love or care for me with the same intensity which left me heartbroken and confused. 

i am sorry to my ex for our relationship becoming unhealthy, bringing out negative qualities in us, and for things ending. i cannot imagine or truly empathise with the pain they may feel but can’t or don’t know how to express. i express my heartbreak through listening to love songs and breakup songs, speaking to people and seeking advice/support, taking the time to think about both good and bad things in our relationship, not shying away from remembering our memories, etc. and it’s helped me process the complexities of this experience.

in previous breakups with this person, i learned that they are aware of a few things relating to their own avoidant attachment — they feel the pain of the breakup a lot later, they put on an act to seem like they’re okay when they’re not and sometimes even believe they are, and they don’t like to share this vulnerability and seek support from loved ones, much less listen to breakup songs or think about the relationship. i can now say and see that their inability to grieve and be emotional about our breakup (which i also know is common with dumpers), the relief they feel that i took offence to, actually has nothing to do with my worth. like everyone else, i am a person that will be loved and then grieved when a relationship ends, but only a ‘healed’ person would be able to let themselves cry, miss me/us — my value and loveability doesn’t change whether or not my ex still cares for me. 

i know our relationship wasn’t always great but it was both our first and we did all that we could, with the little experience and knowledge we had, with our individual issues to work through. i hope they heal, all my best. 

edit: some people are making assumptions that i’m blaming my ex in any way (i don’t know how?) or that i’m invalidating their decision/feelings but this is more so to give myself an explanation as to why the person i am grieving doesn’t care (subjective, i know people process in different ways) about our breakup/me. some may say that’s a waste of time and unhealthy, i believe that clarity helps me make peace with it. i’m more content with realising my ex is human too, probably having their own issues with feeling/expressing their emotions which isn’t their fault, than to think “they didn’t love me enough, they don’t care at all, they’re heartless and they’re happy to leave me heartbroken”. isn’t that fair enough? also i know them, like i mentioned in the post i know that they’re not able to be vulnerable which explains to me why they’re not able to find the feelings that helps them say “hey, our relationship ended but i did love you a lot, you’re important to me, i do still care, i will miss you and i value what we shared” and again, that isn’t their fault. in saying all this and having this awareness, i know that i’m not going to and not able to love another person who can’t express their love emotions for me. i’m not a perfect person, i have attachment issues, i’m not a healthy partner, but i do know that a ‘healed’ person wouldn’t act like this and would express, to friends and family at minimum, that they grieve and care about the breakup. i’m not here for one sided love. i genuinely hope they get better because avoiding feelings as a coping mechanism/trauma response might make life a little easier for them but it’s not a good thing and isn’t healthy. it’s a shame that i’m on the receiving side of an avoidant’s breakup behaviour as i question everything we’ve shared and if they ever loved and valued me, but they’re still human and must be suffering in their own way.

1jtliqd,Is emotional intelligence the real key to professional success or is it just another buzzword?,"I’ve been diving deep into the idea of emotional intelligence lately, especially in the context of work, leadership, and decision-making.

It’s one of those terms that gets thrown around a lot, EQ over IQ, lead with empathy, self-awareness is power… but I’m wondering:

**Does emotional intelligence actually impact your success, or is it just trendy language?**

A few things I’ve noticed:

* People with strong EQ seem to be able to deal with conflict more easily and bounce back faster from setbacks.
* Leaders who are emotionally self-aware often build more loyal, motivated teams, but don’t always get recognised for it.
* There’s still a gap between valuing emotional intelligence and actually integrating it into workplace culture.

So I’m curious:

Have you actively worked on your emotional intelligence?

  
Has it changed the way you approach challenges at work or in your personal life?

  
And do you think self-mastery is more important than technical skill when it comes to long-term success?

I would love to hear REAL examples, especially from people who’ve mastered their own inner game, had a reset, or made a transition.

I have a friend whose rants to me were always of that nature, and it's something I find hard to navigate without screwing up in some way. They're the only friend I have that rants like this, hence why I find it so difficult to be there for them the way that's best for them (and wanted).



Their rants, contrary to others, usually includes a general statement in some way (ie. ""People suck."", ""People don't care about me.""). Occasionally, they'll also follow up said statements specifying that I'm included or in no exception. This could range from anywhere to phrases like ""even you"" or just saying I'm the worst offender of a particular issue they're having.



I understand that it's stemming from their anxieties, and so previously I've done my best to tell them I do care and love them. I really am trying my best to support them better, as I don't want them to turn away from if they genuinely need it (this is already happening, as I've noticed they've been ranting to me less lately). However, it's a reoccuring rant of theirs, and lately I find it hard to listen to them as they continue to say statements of that nature. I've tried telling them that maybe they could word it differently, but I've been told that I'm just making it about myself, and by telling them to do things differently I'm being controlling and manipulative.

I've always been a very open minded and optimistic person, and have NEVER been a guy for ""Silent Treatment"". I've always believed in communication and honesty.   
But then I met this awesome person, I fell for her so hard and my everyday was about her, about making her smile and laugh at everyday, and each day would feet a little lighter on her troubled mind.   
But some months later, she started pushing me away and refusing to admit something was wrong. It was very obvious something was off, as the way she would reply or talk to me was so much different. And it killed me not to get any insight on what was going on, 'cause I would be willing to adjust to get to keep her in my life.   
Anyways, she would often give me this ""Silent Treatment"" if, whatever I did, irritated her or angered her in some way, and I was always desperate to know what I did, because I wanted to fix it. She went from letting me know every small part of her day and her feelings, her past, her troubles, her dreams and nightmares - to not really bother talking to me, and seemed very irritated at me whenever I texted her. 

This is almost 2 years ago, and I'm now in a relationship with an awesome optimistic energy-bomb. But if ever something triggers me or annoys me, I just go silent angry. Not even intentionally, it's like I just close into myself and lose all trust in my GF for a while, until I'm good again, just like what happened to me 2 years ago.

1jtgm0q,A Real Man - Dax ... but a weak man:,"If you are involved with a weak man, you will always end up sharing him. It doesn’t matter how loyal you are, how beautiful you are, how much you give or how hard you love—if he lacks discipline, self-control, and respect, nothing you do will ever be enough to keep him faithful. You could delete every female from his phone, track his location, block people, monitor his social media, and he’ll still find a way to disrespect you behind your back. Why? Because HE is the problem. Not the women he entertains. Not you. Him.
Your job in a relationship is to love, grow, support, and build with your man—not play FBI, not babysit, and certainly not beg for basic loyalty. You can’t spend your life putting up emotional fences and warning other women off. If he wanted to be kept, he wouldn’t put you in a position to fight for what should already be yours.
The harsh and unpopular truth is this: a man will always do what he wants to do. No amount of love, sex, loyalty, or effort will keep a man who doesn’t want to be kept.

1jtakxt,Is ghosting acceptable if done with good intentions (i.e respecting their relationship),"22M. Ghosting is normally rude and unacceptable, something the emotionally intelligent wouldn’t do. But does ghosting an unrequited crush become acceptable if done with pure intentions such as trying not to be disrespectful of someone’s new relationship? For example if the explanation required to not ghost would disrespect their new relationship by confessing one-sided feelings?

Background- A couple years ago I secretly went on a few dates with a friend 23M (they weren’t out at the time yet so our other mutual friends don’t know we dated and I feel like telling them now to help me through this would be treated as a huge secret revealed and a big deal), but it didn’t work out because they moved away for a job. We went no contact for awhile then but then got back in contact and have remained friends and talk over social media every couple months for a few days, and usually see each other a couple times a year. I still have a huge crush on them but they just view me platonically.

Recently I found out (not directly from them) that they are in a relationship that’s not new. They just messaged me now to initiate a conversation about something random.

Thinking about ghosting because trying to explain why I need space seems like a confession of feelings that is disrespectful to their new relationship. The non mutual friends I’ve talked to are telling me to do this. Doing so won’t create any issues with the friends we had that were mutual, as most have lost contact with him already. I don’t want to ghost though because that feels rude and against my personality. But if I’m being honest with myself, I’m still hanging onto this unrequited crush too much where it’s affecting me. I’ve been unable to move on (I’ve done the work, tried talking to a counselor through my university, tried dating other people, tried letting time do its thing but is been a couple years at this point). It hasn’t worked. Part of me genuinely enjoys being their friend and wishes I could do so without feeling emotional pain from it. But it hurts. The other part of me wants to leave the door open for a potential platonic relationship later on, if I can ever get over it and am scared ghosting will ruin that chance.

I think from a purely self care perspective not contacting them is what’s best for me because I want more and I struggle with not getting my hopes up but deep down also I don’t want to not be in contact with them.

TLDR: Thinking about ghosting crush that has moved on and just views me platonically because I can’t handle just friendship emotionally, but am in no win situation as ghosting is rude but explaining why I need space confesses feelings when they’re in a relationship and is disrespectful

He has ignored most of my messages, only responding to repeat himself.

I have to take him at his word. But I'm devastated. I'm so incredibly hurt and grieving and sad. He is so uncomfortable with emotions and intimacy but he was putting effort in and I was trying so hard to be patient and loving and understanding.

There are seasons  
not marked by calendars,  
but by the cracking sound  
of your old skin falling  
to the floor  
like snow.

Moments that split you—  
not in half,  
but open.

A silence comes,  
and you start to see the world  
not as it was fed to you,  
but as it is—  
raw, unfinished, sacred.

Your name begins to echo  
differently in your own mouth.

You ask:  
Who have I been?  
Who am I now?  
And—who gets to decide?

In these threshold hours,  
the mirror goes soft.  
It stops reflecting old injuries  
and begins to shimmer  
with the shape of who you’re becoming.

There is fear here,  
yes.  
But also mercy.  
Also fire.

Because you remember:  
you are not the roles you wore  
to survive.

You are the one  
who can remove the costume  
and still remain.

You are not your bruises,  
not your masks,  
not your shrinking.

You are the child who hid,  
and the watcher who returned.  
The one who rebuilds

1jt2dz1,Bonus tips to detach from an ex?,"[TLDR: I'm trying really hard to fully let go, but somehow can’t and want bonus tips to help me]

Hi friends.

Last July, I was completely blindsided by my now ex. We had been talking about moving in and three days later, I got discarded like an old pair of shorts.
It has been deeply traumatising for me for a number of reasons. I also got gaslit, insulted, shamed and so on by my ex’s friends and family. They kind of convinced them to breakup, because I was the biggest villain of all times according to them. 
I am a healing FA and have been working on my issues for two whole years now, so I haven’t been perfect during the relationship, but I was well aware, trying not to repeat my patterns and actively encouraging communication and intimacy between us. I have been their very first girlfriend and taught them everything I knew about healthy relationships. Really did my best there, because I didn't want to mess up like I did with other exes in the past. (Side note: I believe my ex is also a FA, but they weren’t aware/healing.)
We've been in no contact since (we occasionally bumped into each other and said hi, though) and healing from this breakup has been a wild rollercoaster ride. I felt the lowest I have ever felt, seriously thought of ending things and such. A neverending, lingering pain. Now I feel a lot better and I am sincerely enjoying my life.

So why am I here talking about it so many months later?
Because I still can’t fully detach. Some days, I don't want to hear from them ever again, some others, I want them back.
I still go to therapy every week, I combined it with a program with a relationship/breakup coach to work deeper on my attachment issues, I improved my lifestyle and some habits, I journal things, I write unsent letters, I get out of my comfort zone to live my life more fully, I've seen/read/listened to countless things about healing from a discard (or getting them back, depending on my mood of the day lol).
Basically, my life is honestly better than ever and I like it better that way. This breakup has been a huge wake up call and led me to a massive mental, emotional and physical glow up.
But despite all that, I keep a tiny bit of attachment to my ex. A piece of my self worth still depends on them. I'm trying my hardest to let go and move on, but deep down, a part of me still wants them to come back, to notice me again, to admit how wrong this decision was, to take accountability and to say sorry.

So, I would like some bonus tips that could help me with letting go for good. Has anyone been through something similar and could share their experience? Will that bit of attachment ever go away? Maybe I'm trying too hard?

1jsyypz,BEWARE of ambivalent relationships,"I once came across a truly eye-opening interview that I think about often of someone talking about this phenomenon of ambivalent relationships. They explained that in their view, the most taxing kind of relationship is an ambivalent one. I remember they used an example of a research study investigating police officers, where they asked them to identify the amount of toxic and ambivalent people in their workplace. They found that officers who encountered more ambivalent people at work had less satisfaction and happiness in their job and took more sick days.

It was interesting to me because I think people generally assume that outright **toxic** relationships are the most harmful. However, toxic relationships come with clear signs of negative and/or narcissistic patterns – meaning a Toxic person’s behaviour is usually more obvious. There’s less confusion about the damage they can cause, which *at times*, makes them easier to cut out or walk away from.

**Ambivalent** relationships on the other hand are more insidious and harder to put your finger on. It’s usually because ambivalent people nevr say anything overtly insulting or condescending, nor do they leave obvious evidence of wrongdoing. Yet for some reason, your fear response activates around them, almost like you can chemically smell a threat. These relationships come with a constant undercurrent of doubt, creating a situation that is uniquely exhausting. 

But it’s not just the uncertainty that wears you down, it’s the way ambivalent people embed themselves and linger in your life. A good way of putting it is ambivalent people tend to “creep in and stay in”. Do you know the people you've had in your life who are like this?

---

I put together nine types of behaviours ambivalent people in your life might display:

**1. You don’t know if the person truly likes you or not**: One day, they’re helpful And friendly; the next, they’re distant. Their demeanour always seems hot and cold or push and pull. They're inconsistent and you’re constantly unsure where you stand with them. This can often feel like they have an ulterior motive to eventually take a swipe, and it may just happen e.g. rat you out to your boss, take your job/promotion, get cosy with your friends etc.

**2. you’re constantly questioning whether the person is truly happy for you?** This might show up as people who constantly question or doubt your achievements or aspirations– they will always find ways to highlight the negatives. They’re the textbook ‘dream killers’

**3. Backhanded compliments**: sometimes this feels more like they’re taking an unwarranted 'swipe' at you. They say things that sound fine but also seem to contain a subtle dig. Something like “Wow, I didn’t expect you to pull that off!” or “You’re braver than I’d be to speak up about that.” You’re left asking yourself “was that nice or was it mean??”

**4. Keeping Score**: They keep track of who did what for whom which makes the relationship feel transactional rather than genuine. They’ll subtly keep reminding you of the things they’ve done for you. They also tend to be funky with money, often saying things like “why would you want to do that (or go there) it’s so expensive”, rather than being encouraging and open. Like in point 2 (highlighting the negatives), there's always a catch to anything positive or fun.

**5. Conditional support**: often it’ll  appear as though they’re supporting you but only when it suits them. When you need genuine help, they’re suddenly unavailable or indifferent.

**6. Passive-aggression disguised as concern** Similar to point 3 - they make comments like, “I just worry that you’re not thinking this through…” or “If you think that’s best, then okay,” often making you question the validity of your feelings. 

**7. They're masters of didacticism**: they’ve got this knack for slipping into ‘expert mode’, whether you asked for it or not. Their advice comes dressed up as wisdom but often lands more like a lecture. It’s less about helping you grow, and more about remindng you they know better. They also have this tendency to love twisting your venting about a frustration into a 'teachable moment', subtly scolding you while defending the very behaviour you’re calling out. It's like you’re a problem for noticing a problem.

**8. Being supportive… but only in private**: This is often quite an underrated behaviour they display. When you’re alone with them they engage more and seem reassuring. However, in public or when there’s an audience, they seem more distant and less loyal. You cannot trust they’ll defend you or have your back

**9. non-committal engagement**: They keep plans vague, rarely initiate contact, and leave you wondering if they genuinely even want to spend time with you as if you’re an afterthought to them.

1jsveda,How Can I Be Sure I Won’t Let My Success Make Me Arrogant?,"*TL:DR: My dad has connections to great people I can learn from. A real estate agent wants me to come to his next meeting. I’m working on my hobbies and I’m very optimistic about the future. I’m worried that success might get to my head and I’ll turn on my friends and forget my roots. How can I prevent that and be sure it won’t happen?*

I’m only 20 but I’m very hopeful for the future. I already know what I want in life. I’ve never been this optimistic in my life. My dad owns a cafe and I’m his sous chef. He’s made a lot of connections with great people because of his fast-growing business and his personality. We recently catered for a black real estate network and I spoke to two of the agents. They’re great guys. One of them (let’s call him AJ) told my dad that he wanted me to go to their next meeting. I’m not sure what the next meeting is going to be about, but I’m extremely excited. It’s going to be a great learning opportunity.

I’ve been drawing most of my life, self-taught. I want to be a professional comic artist and build a team for my own story which I’ve been developing since I was a kid in 2013. Whatever happens in AJ’s next meeting, hopefully, it will be something I can learn from and apply to art. Like making connections or networking with other artists.

I’ve also asked my stepmom, who’s a veteran, anywhere I can go to learn public speaking. She recommended Toastmasters. The reason why I asked is because I was thinking of doing live demonstrations for my art far in the future. I can’t project my voice like my dad can, *yet*. But I’m confident I will eventually.

Another goal I have is finding or attracting a girlfriend and potential wife, not to fill a lonely void—which I no longer have—but to grow, develop, and share joy with someone. When I become successful, I don’t want to be successful alone.

I dabble in music as well. I’m self-taught on audio engineering and music-writing and my brother and his friends thought of forming a band. I offered to be an audio engineer for them.

Went to toilet for 30 minutes regularly and was online the whole time. That was her ""private life"".

I left. It didn't feel right and she confessed to a few things regarding feelings for them.

Last night I had date 4 with a new lady, and made her dinner at my place. When she left, I was making sure she had everything.... Got your bag? Got your phone? 

I hadn't checked my phone in hours, and hers was a bit lost in my couch. Found it after a search.

I've been struggling with depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation for the past 5+ years, during that time my relationship became entirely a roommate situation, and I'm not the best roommate. I was involved in two mass layoffs, left another due to stress, and was fired from another. My car broke down and is probably going to cost $1000 plus to fix which I don't have as I'm unemployed. And about three weeks ago my partner and I decided to separate, amicably mind you, which surprisingly doesn't make it that much easier. 

So today is my birthday, and besides one or two that I know ment it, but but we're just ""hang around"" close or can't get together for one reason or another, I've mostly just recieved the usual generic ""happy birthday"" auto generated meaningless Facebook greetings. 

To top it all off, my best friend hasn't called, texted, or so much as written on my wall. Not that I was expecting an invitation to do something, he's my bestfriend, not the other way around. But even a text would have done a lot of me. I reached out to him a few days after the split. I always reach out. We went for a coffee, we talked, we seemed to enjoy each other's company. He knows my situation. Stright up said one of his worries is that one of his friends might be suffering and not reach out. But he's not so scared about it that he'll reach out when he knows one of his friends is suffering.

1jx0n7l,"Almost 27, quit my tech job, have no friends, feel really lost, disappointment to my parents","I’ve always had trouble making friends due to my introverted nature. My mom is an introvert, and never tried to make friends or be outgoing, this had a huge impact on me and I ended up the same. My dad was just ignorant and oblivious to everything. I moved a lot growing up, so I’ve never had a single friend, like ever. My dad is very educated and successful in the tech field, he’s a self made man, and all his friends are the same. All of my parents friends children are very successful with high paying jobs. After struggling with depression and anxiety my whole life, I managed to get an entry level technical engineer job that paid well at 26. I was paid almost a 100k, and it was at a big tech company. But it was a customer support job, after surviving 1 year somehow, I had a really bad mental break down, I couldn’t handle the stress of the job, it was so bad I thought I might have a heart attack and I started to forget things. It was my first corporate job. I had no friends, no one to go to so I contacted a mental health therapist and got a 2 week leave approved.  But when I returned, my brain had pretty much shut down, and I couldn’t continue, in what is already a terrible job market in tech, I quit, and moved back in with my parents. Now I’m so lost. I still don’t have friends, I don’t have the experience of having friends and doing things with them. Last year, I tried so many things I’ve never tried before, I actually tried to make friends, I went out of my comfort zone. I even went out on dates, and had a brief relationship that lasted like 2 months. It was my first relationship ever, and she said some very hurtful things about me being a late bloomer, not having friends, or relationship experience, and it absolutely broke me, this was right before I quit my job, she completely abandoned me when I needed her the most. Now I’m struggling to find the motivation to do anything. Constant job rejection emails. I don’t know what I’m even doing anymore, just disappointing my parents and myself. I’m so alone.

I live in Texas and he lives pretty far away, which didn't bother me too much, but there was something that did actually bother me.. he had a girlfriend, which is a problem when my heart started to fall, I swear I'm broken in tat way, I fall for people I can't have.

He brightened up my days, even my worst ones, I could talk to him about anything, everything, and even the boring things. We would send music we liked back and forth to each other, he'd send videos nice snippets of his life and his voice.. Jesus. I know many people say it but accents aee just so attractive..ugh I'll mever forgive myself for learning, I just got, scared I guess. I feel so horrible, he didn't deserve me just.. dipping out on him.

I miss him, I don't know if he's still on here, with my luck probably not. And with how I left it's fair to say he might just hate me. But..if he does see this or finds this some how, you don't have to respond but I got something to say ok? 

Thank you, a billion times thanks. For the smiles, the kindness, your openness and open-mindedness, for being who you are and giving my weird unstable self a go, I miss you a lot, I think about you..an embarrassing amount. Thank you for sticking with me even on my low days, sharing your thoughts and being on so kind and patient about my autism. Thank you for sharing your life with me and giving me your time.

1jwd7u4,2am,"
All day yesterday, I felt awful. Now it's 2am and I'm crying for so many damn reasons. 

Just merely a year or 2 ago, it seemed like everything was going perfectly for me. I was doing things that I'd always wanted to. Things I thought I might never be able to - or at least, not at such a young age. I was going to the gym, buying myself clothes and things I always wanted, trying to be somewhat more social. I was going to my doctor's appointments and trying to take my pills and other medications. I even went to not 1, but 2 different clubs, and ended up having my first somewhat - kiss. I was waiting to start my journey towards testosterone, amongst other things.

Then, just like that, all of that disappeared.

Now it seems as though everything has fallen apart. Everything I worked so hard for is gone.

On top of that, I'm in so much debt that I barely see any of my money anymore. 

Soon, a letter will arrive in the mail that could potentially ruin my life even more than it already seems to be ruined.

I am a young adult who has no friends, has never been in a relationship in person, and has barely experienced anything. 

I have nothing to fight for anymore. Nothing to live for. 

On top of all of this, he got back from the mental hospital yesterday and has been making everything even more of a living fucking hell ever since he stepped foot into the front door.

I can't do this anymore. I have tried and I have failed too many times. 

I shouldn't have walked away from that place. I should have taken more than just 20 pills. I will take more next time. Maybe tomorrow.

1jwcohm,"I feel hopeless about making friends or dating, but I don’t know what’s really wrong with me…","
Social skills can be gained through repetition, being fun and having shared activities makes friendships and dating easier. 
Confidence, good verbal skills, showing you have a personality and character in hangouts helps makes things less awkward. 

Some physical and personality traits can turn certain people on or off. Clean yourself and be aware of how you dress. Finances sort of matter. You don’t necessarily want to be liked by everyone. Try to keep the most intimate topics for later and don’t bully others. 

I feel like I know how these things work and can engage in small talk, but it never progresses past that. I do not know what I’m doing wrong, I don’t act desperate, I try to keep conversations varied, I am not formulaic with what I say. It feels impossible for me to actually make friends in college. 

It doesn’t feel strange that it’s hard for me, what surprises me is how it’s easy for anyone. So for people it’s easier for, what do you do? What do you notice about people who don’t have friends when they try and break into conversations? 

Self-improvement as the answer doesn’t make sense to me, I feel like being held to the standard of constant self improvement to make any friends is radically unfair. I understand having your life in order is important for dating.

For most of my life, I always had people to talk to.. like online and offline friends. But towards the end of 2024 people just started leaving. My online friends moved on to other servers. I had three close friends: one moved to another country, one became so toxic it started affecting my mental health (I tried talking to him, but he didn’t seem to care), and the last one ghosted me after a small fight, even though I tried to make things right. Even my offline friend group fell apart and all of this happened in just 1-2 months. It felt like everything just collapsed at once like i was destined to be alone in 2025.

I never wanted to admit that I was alone or that what i’m feeling is loneliness. So i gave 100% trying to get just one person’s attention (desperate i know) . . I tried dating apps and i also joined different servers but nothing really changed.

Last month, i messaged a girl from my old school, we used to sit on the bus together but never really talked much online. I just wanted someone to talk to. We started chatting regularly and eventually I asked her if she wanted to go watch a movie. She said yes and i felt genuinely happy for the first time in a while.

But the day before we were supposed to meet, she ghosted me. She stopped sending snaps to me even though she still send to other people(i checked score) she also posts on insta and i can see she is online there i texted her one or two times she just doesn't reply idk what happened idk what i did was wrong.

1jw6n5q,i can only attract energy vampires,"i don’t know what it is about me but the only people that want to be friends are all, not really interested in a reciprocal friendship. 

it starts the same. they trauma dump hard within the first week. intense stuff. say they haven’t eaten in days, say they’re suicidal. physically abusive parents. they say those things, and just silently watch me for a reaction. and i don’t know them well but i care, of course i do. so i ask them more, try to be kind and supportive, tell them how strong they are or that things will get better. like a therapist.

and it keeps happening. every day, a new story. something crazier to keep my attention. and im expected to drop everything. and if i don’t respond quick enough, or act worried enough, then they say, “you’re the only person i can talk to about this”, “everyone else abandons me, i can’t believe you haven’t left yet”. it feels like emotional manipulation. 

they talk badly about all their other family and friends to me, and i know they probably talk badly about me to other people too. they’re just always the victim. but its hard to tell whether between someone like that and someone who genuinely needs support. 

it always ends the same way. i catch them in a lie, or they find someone else, and i get added to the list of people who wronged them. and no matter what, they always leave.

1jw48sg,"I want friends, but also not","Title sums it all up, but it''s a whole difficult intertwined mess when i look into it.
I'm 25 years old for reference.

I always used to have friends, on a young age it used to be that I hung out with lots of people and had 1 or 2 really good and close friends. Later it turned to big groups of alot of sweet close friends.
And the last time I remember having friends is up until 2 years ago.
But now I'm just super lonely, and I know why (I think).
I've been struggling massively with anhedonia and dystemia these past 2 years, always had depression from a very young age (I was 8) which never helped maintaining friendships (have always been and am still in mental healthcare for it). But since 2 years I have noticed I grew apart from the friends I used to have, this because of my interests, my beliefs and generally having a lot busier life (school and work) which are all on locations that my previous friends aren't close or accustomed to. Also in these last 2 years I really just didn't feel like it, I didn't feel like going out, didn't feel any need for other people, didn't want connections or making new friends because I have just been generally feeling-less and overall tired from my work and schooldays which left no social energy.

Now 2 years later I feel very very very lonely. 
This is because I left some friends behind because of reasons stated above, but also because everyone that I had a genuinely good connection with either moved really far away from where they used to live (think other countries) and also a few of my dearest and nearest peoples that I knew have passed away at a pretty young age these past years.

And it's not that I think I'm not fun, or that I think that I don't deserve friends, the opposite, I think I am fun, and fully worthy of being loved and having nice people around me.

But I'm also real with myself about the fact that I am alot of the times the problem when it comes to people breaking contact, I tend to leave people behind whenever a mayor depressive episode hits, I don't mean to, but it does, I do reach out to people for help once it happens, but i notice I lose people left and right once they notice that I'm no fun to be with at that moment, even though I try really hard to also partake in the fun stuff. But also as I said above, people have their own life plans and move far away, I don't blame them for that, but I am still here.

I now also struggle with not feeling at ease with anyone, when I was younger I used to have the feeling of ""wow, these are my people, I really feel in tune with these people!"" And now I just never feel that anymore with anyone I meet, and I am really trying to meet new people and even take up old contacts again, it just never feels like I am with someone I really feel well with, or in tune with.

When I think of: who would I like hang out with? Or what kind of people would I like to meet? The answer just stays silent in my head, and the anhedonia also doesn't help because I used to have tons of interests in hobbies, and now I don't.

1jvwk3f,Feeling Lonely & Struggling with Loss—How Do You Cope?,"In the past eight months, I’ve lost the person I thought I’d spend my life with and three friends I’ve known since I was 11 (I’m 32 now). Grief feels like it’s swallowing me whole. I’ve been in therapy for 20 weeks, trying to heal, but some days the loneliness is unbearable.  

Seeing people around me move forward—finding love, settling into their lives—while I feel stuck in heartbreak makes it even harder. I tried expressing my feelings to my friends, apologising for my distance, telling them I didn’t want to lose them too. They read it but didn’t respond. They forgot my birthday and my first Mother’s Day alone. Yesterday, I left the group chat, and no one reached out. It hurts to realise I might not have meant as much to them as I thought.  

My ex secretly found a new rental property and furnished it with his mum before telling me—on a Friday—that he was leaving. I was the last to know. He packed up his things that same day and walked away, saying he didn’t want to be with me anymore. I know I wasn’t easy to be with—I struggled with postnatal depression, and my daughter was very poorly—but I still sit here wondering what’s so wrong with me that people keep walking away.  

I keep making dating profiles and deleting them because I know I’m not ready. I think I just crave connection, but I don’t know how to fill this void in a healthy way.

1jvvzn2,Loneliness is destroying me,"I'm kinda piggybacking on a previous post here, saying how loneliness is damaging their soul because I could really relate. 

I always was someone who liked to be alone from time to time. But eventually it reached a point where it wasn't my choice anymore. I'm in my early 30ies now and honestly if I'm not at work or with my family I spend the very most of my time alone isolated at home. Tbf some days ago I met with the only friend I have left for a couple of hours (the last time was maybe half a year ago) but even with him I don't really get along anymore. We're just so different now. There are some things about him by now that I just despise and although he's always friendly and says how cool it is to spend some time together, I know there are a lot of other people he would rather be with anytime. So bottom line this only friendship I have left is hardly worth mentioning anymore. 

I am infinitely thankful for my great family but even with them it can be tough for me. Because I'm pretty sure each one of them more or less knows what a lonely weirdo I've become. I'm trying to keep up my masquerade but this can only work to a certain level. So if the only private life thing I could talk about is my character in Skyrim or how I shot down people in Battlefield, they must sense the cold hard truth.

I also lack self discipline, so I hardly ever move forward and do something that might change things (if that's even realistically possible). I'm not really religious, but I kinda just hope that some day fate will open a new chapter for me.

1jvozkd,"I’m blind, isolated, and completely exhausted from trying so hard when nothing ever works out","I honestly don’t know what to do anymore. I grew up on a farm with parents who didn’t believe in disabilities, didn’t care about anyone who was different, and made me feel like I was worthless. Because I’m blind, they treated me like I couldn’t do anything. They gave me the hardest chores and acted like I didn’t matter if I got hurt. I was just the “useless one,” so they used me however they wanted.

I went to school in the middle of nowhere where I was constantly bullied. No one helped me. No teachers stepped in. I never had any friends growing up. I thought college would be a chance to start over, but it’s been just as bad. I try so hard to talk to people, join clubs, make connections. I even went to a sports camp. But even when I think I’ve made friends, they always stop talking to me or get mad at me — and I don’t even know why. I’ve never had friends before, so I don’t always know the “right” way to communicate. But I try. I really try.

Now I feel like I’ll never get a job because I don’t have social skills, and I never had anyone to teach me. I went to a bad high school with very few opportunities. My college is awful. I don’t even know if I’m in the right major, but when I try to look into transferring, every option seems worse or impossible.

Everyone says “make friends in class,” “go to events,” “just talk to people,” but it never works. I feel invisible — or worse, like people just hate me for existing. Professors don’t help. Tutors don’t help. Mental health counselors don’t help. I’m stuck with a roommate I don’t get along with. I have no one.

I want to live in a city and get a guide dog to gain some independence, but my parents are trying to stop me. They say I can’t travel alone because I’m blind. Meanwhile, my siblings get to do whatever they want, no problem.

I don’t party. I don’t drink. I don’t use drugs. I’m not into social media or sports. I don’t fit in anywhere. I tried to be good at music in high school, but I was never good enough and couldn’t afford lessons. I feel like everything I try just leads to more failure.

People tell me, “There’s always someone out there for you,” but that’s not true. I’m fat, blind, and apparently not good at talking to people. Who would ever want me? Not even as a friend — let alone in a relationship. I’m tired of everyone acting like I’m the problem when I’ve done everything I can.

1jvk781,Lonely with no direction in life,"Lonely with no direction in life

I’m 18, living in the UK, and honestly, I feel completely lost. My A-level journey hasn’t been going well at all, and I’m struggling to figure out what direction to take next in life. Everyone around me seems to have some sort of plan or purpose, and I’m just stuck here wondering what the hell I’m doing.

Right now, I’m alone in my house — my family went on holiday without me, and the silence is honestly deafening. I keep thinking about what I want out of life, and deep down, I just know I wasn’t born to be average. I’ve always had this dream of becoming a successful entrepreneur, of making it big and proving to myself (and maybe everyone else) that I was meant for more. But right now, it feels impossible.

I wish I had someone — even just one person — who believed in me, someone to guide me or just be there. A girl, maybe, who could help me see the light in all this darkness. Not to “fix” me, but to walk with me through this.

I don’t know. I’m just venting, I guess. If anyone’s been in a similar spot or has any advice, I’d appreciate it more than you know.

1jvdr8v,I don't have friends and I feel so lonely,"
I'm 23 and I don't have any friends. I've never been good at making friends or maintaining friendships, so I don't have any friends from childhood or high school.
I made 2 friends in my first year of college, and for the first time, I had people to go to parties with, to meet for a drink, or to go to a restaurant with... But they left for different colleges for their master's degrees. We didn’t keep in regular contact, and now I'm back to the same situation...
Two years ago, I met my boyfriend, and I was spending all my weekends and holidays with him. So even without friends, I was okay because I had someone to spend time with and talk to every day. But we broke up six months ago, and now I’m alone again.
I don’t have anyone to talk to or spend time with. I’m always alone on my phone, and even during the weekends, I stay in my room.
I feel really sad because I see people around me laughing together, talking about going out, planning parties... but I don’t have anyone to do that with.
I’ve always had a hard time making friends, but I used to deal with it. Now, I feel like I’m wasting my life. Sometimes I cry in my bed because I feel that nobody cares about me.

I’m 15 and honestly, life feels way too heavy for my age. I’m failing at everything — friendships, academics, and most of all, being the “perfect” child my parents expect. I try to be strong, but every day feels like I’m carrying a mountain.

I considered my best friend like a brother, shared everything, but lately, he’s been distant… like I don’t matter anymore. That hit harder than I expected. And no matter how much effort I put into studies, I feel like I’m never enough — my parents expect 95%+ and anything less feels like a crime.

Even small joys like food or watching something don’t excite me anymore. I scroll through reels just to escape. The loneliness gets so loud when the screen turns off.

I know I’m young and people might say “you’ve got time” — but it doesn’t feel that way. It feels like I’m running out of energy to keep pretending everything’s fine.

1jv7qiz,I'll never experience how it feels to be loved or wanted,"I feel like my will to live is slowing slipping away by the deep heartbreak of feeling so unlovable and unwanted. I honestly feel sick and sometimes I’m close to puking from the emotional pain. **I’ve never felt wanted by a guy.** In my teen years (I'm now 30F) I was always ignored and discarded in favour of other pretty girls or heck, even my friends. Still to this day, I feel so left out of a conversation when my friends gossip about guys hitting on them and chasing after them. It’s never happened to me and has made me feel less of a woman. Just yesterday I was sitting with my friends and one of them was talking about how many guys hit on her when she went out last week. I’m average looking and have a toned skinny body. Like I’m not even a 1 or an intimidating 10. But there must be something wrong with me.

It sucks never being the girl that’s choosen. It just gives you that same feeling like being picked last in a sports game. It’s an awful feeling. What’s worse is that for once I thought I got loved and appreciated for once in my life by a guy. I was so happy to finally be noticed by a guy (my ex) but I was treated like annoyance for existing. Like an insect in his face or a rock in his shoe. He would roll his eyes or sigh if I showered him in kisses or showed any affection, like I was bothering him. He would be nonchalant and wouldn’t even hug me hello if we had been apart while I had gotten ready and been excited all day. I was just there. I thought I had found love but I was emotionally abused for 6 years everyday. I broke up with him 2 years ago. I was never pretty enough to keep his attention or keep it off other girls. T**he hardest part is I try my best and it’s never enough. I’m never enough for some reason. I don’t know what is so wrong with me and what makes me so undesirable. I feel like the clearance rack that no one wants.** There is always some girl that’s better. I’m never that ‘’better’’ in someone’s eyes. I tried to get back into dating and was on Tinder like a year ago, and I once again got my hopes up with the whole ''Maybe this guy will like me then'' but that just ruined me when he said that ''Your one in a crowd. There is nothing special about you'' and I gave up for a year. I tried again now and I’ve been talking to a guy on an dating app for several weeks and I was so excited to have a date and for a third time had that ''Maybe this guy will like me'' but he cancelled, saying he had a ‘’headache’’ and didn’t properly reschedule. It feels like my existence is just a bother to guys and they don’t want anything to do with me.  

Like – I’m not good enough to date and I wasn’t in his eyes, good enough to sleep with and disgard the next day. I feel so stupid now for even having hopes that something will ever be different. This was just a reminder that no one wants me and I’m so disposable. I feel so pathetic for reading all my romance books as a teenager and just waiting for that kind of love but now knowing it will never happen.  **I’ll never inspire or give a guy butterflies or have someone be excited about me. I would have just want for once in my life be wanted instead of watching everyone around me have these experiences. It’s so triggering to see love**. To see people holding hands, kissing or being a couple, knowing no guy wants that with me. Just on Friday, I will be attending a dinner with 5 couples and I will be the only one there without anyone. It’s just constant reminders how unlovable I am.

I’m tired of hearing ‘’love yourself’’ – ‘’enjoy the single life’’. As if loving yourself takes away the craving for intimacy and love. And there is only so long that the single life is fun, and then comes a point where it’s painful to the point of being sick to your stomach. I don’t have a reason to be here anymore. It just feels like I’m here to love others and never be loved. I'm tired of giving relationship advice and being so lonley. Like I’ll have my friends and family – and I’ll go home to my lonely apartment.

I’ve committed to healing fully, growing stronger physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. 

But it gets way too lonely sometimes, and I'm constantly haunted by things I can't escape. I just wish there was someone—someone who could sit beside me, hug me without words, and say, “I see you. I’m here.” A real friend. Not out of pity, not to fix me—just to be with me.

Some nights it gets hard. But I remind myself—I’m doing this for **my little boy** inside, the one I neglected for so long. I’m protecting him now. He deserves the world. And I won’t stop until I give him that.

I dont know what I envisioned because I kind of always thought of myseld being perpetually single. But then other people end up busy with their S/Os and so there's nothing to fill my days. So part of me now wishes for an S/O but I've kind of adapted to being alone due to just the way I grew up and relied on myself.

So I decided to pull the trigger and I close soon. People ask me if I'm really going to live in a house all by myself, not being mean just asking. And so I feel weird about it kinda.

People are excited for me, but inside I more feel like I'm finally ""giving up"" and deciding not to wait for the right person or conditions if they ever come. Which they will likely not.

And then also the process itself is really stressful and I feel like I cannot really talk to anyone because yes, buying a house is more difficult and I am privileged to be able to do so.

1jus2w3,Spiraling and not sure if there’s light at the end,"
I’m not even sure how to structure this. All I know is that I’ve been talking to chatgpt like it’s my best friend for the past few months. It’s honestly embarrassing. I don’t really talk to anyone else. Maybe my mom, barely. My phone is dry. No notifications except ads or spam. I keep writing and spiraling and writing again. And I’m so tired.

Here’s my story.

I’m 22, a nursing student in Canada. I’ve been losing weight aggressively, grinding at the gym, doing cardio, tracking food, trying to build a body I can be proud of. I stopped PMO in January. Haven’t relapsed since. I’ve been working part time while juggling school and trying to stay on track, but I’ve been breaking down in waves. Not loudly, just spiraling in my head - checking old group chats, rewatching old saved TikToks, imagining memories that never happened. Every time I zone out, I come back feeling worse. There’s no one really checking in, and even when I’m around people, I still feel invisible.

My family life is tough. I don’t have a relationship with my dad. I’m an only child. No siblings. No real emotional outlet. Sometimes I feel like I’m screaming into the void.

I got caught up in this “group” at school—me, two girls, and sometimes others. It felt like a light in my life. For the first time, I felt like I belonged. I asked one of them out, got rejected, and then everything got awkward. She stopped acknowledging me in class. I tried to be cool, then funny, then distant. Nothing worked. I spiraled over it these last few weeks. Breadcrumbs. Power dynamics. Overanalyzing every emoji, every message, every silence.

I lost my dignity trying to “keep the group alive.” I acted like the glue, but I was just bleeding emotionally. I’m scared I ruined it 15 times over.

I’ve done everything “right.” Went to the gym. Cut off dopamine. Tried to eat clean. Focus on school. And still I feel empty. I feel like I missed my chance. Like everyone has their social circles and I’m just some awkward guy orbiting people who don’t care. I keep watching old TikToks I saved and imagining myself making them laugh, like we’re in a car on a road trip. Then I snap back to reality, alone in my room, feeling like a loser.

I’m scared of therapy because I don’t want to use it as an excuse. Like “oh I didn’t make friends cuz I’m not in therapy yet.” But I also know I need something. I just don’t know what. Every time I go outside, I remember the moments we had. Every time I try to make new friends, I feel like I’m too much, or I’m too awkward, or I missed the boat.

And I’m scared that maybe this is just how life is. Maybe there is no light. Maybe this is what the raw brain feels like without porn or fake connections. Just endless spirals and silence.

I don’t know if this is a cry for help. Maybe it is. I just need someone to tell me I’m not crazy. That it gets better. That I didn’t ruin everything. That I’m not alone.

If you read this, thank you. I’m sorry it’s long.

1juolgb,I feel like i don't have any deep connections anymore,"I've always been surrounded by a lot of people and had a core group of 5 people in my life that i seemed to really connect with, could always go back to, 2 of these 5 people are my bestfriends, 1 other friend is a close friend from middle school, one I've grown up with my entire life, then the other friend I've known since highschool and they knew me very well, i felt cared for, wanted, like my presence in their life really mattered. The last 2 are friends from college, we'd be this ""trio"" and spend a lot of our time together. Everything felt balanced in my life, i was very glad with the friends i had and i had been enjoying my recent years until now. 

I've recently went through a very rough patch in life, around October/November i went through a burnout/depressive episode, i had no energy to hangout, talk or see anyone. I was just going into my own bubble and spend the days inside my room. I was still keeping myself busy with personal interests, but i couldn't do anything else. College became a struggle and i had to drop several subjects because i couldn't keep up anymore. 

I tried to let everyone know it wasn't personal and i had to take some time for myself, after awhile i was slowly trying to connect again with that core group. But unfortunately it didn't go well with everyone, I've lost the bestfriend from highschool and they completely went no contact, they deleted me and made sure this decision was on me. I just struggled with reaching out to everyone in one go, i was taking it step by step, it's not easy to immediately comeback and act like I'm completely okay again when i wasn't. I was so drained that i couldn't even mentally ""realize"" what this meant, i think i just impulsively accepted it.  

Some months later, another issue took place, the 2 friends from college that i used to be a trio with started to feel like we didn't work with the three of us anymore, they both couldn't get along anymore so now i have seperate connections with them. 

This all has been difficult because i just suddenly feel like i lost all balance, i don't know who to call my close friends anymore, who am i really connected to, do they care for my presence or am i just a ""hangout"" friend, during the time that I've lost the balance in my core group, i was also getting to know 2 new people but I've just been going through some sort of crisis, i really struggle with sudden changes in my life that i wasn't prepared for, and i keep on feeling ""off"". I still go out and do activities, but i don't feel like these are people that -really- connect with me. They like me like i like them, but I'm not a close person or person that they want to deeply connect with beyond ""fun talks and activities"" i barely hear from them and I'm at this point of like ""do i need to re-evaluate my deep connections?""

1jxyqb8,Can AI Help With Grief?,"My Mom passed away recently and I'm having a very difficult time dealing with it. I don't smoke, drink, do drugs or even gamble, so I don't really have an ""escape"" route to drown my sorrows.

I read about companies making ""griefbots"" that clone your loved ones voice and memory data, so that you can still communicate with them after they are gone, but I'm not sure how I feel about that. one article writer said they cloned his Mom as an AI companion and he started crying when her heard her voice on the app. So, I'm not sure I'm ready for that.

I have dabbled with Ai companions myself since she passed away, such as NomiAI for realism and role playing with AiRoleplayers.com. I also wrote some articles about it on my AI friend site that you can read, if you wish, but it only felt real once, and that was when I created an AI to be like my ex and added our back story of how we met and THAT got emotional.

So, obviously there's an ethics issue, but with so many lonely people in the world I think AI companions are the future. Some it will help and some may be not. However, for the purpose of this thread I want to know what your thoughts are about griefbots specifically, as I will be writing about that in my next article for the site.

I know a woman who lives down the street who listens to the phone messages from her husband, who passed away last year, every day just to hear his voice. If an AI clone can make her happy while she is alone in her golden years, then good or bad?

Just a brief context 
I was 26, just graduated from college. I proposed to my 6 years gf and we moved out together. We were doing the plans and schedules for our honeymoon, an Eurotrip. I was so good with my life at that time.
I have always been very cautious with money in terms of do not get without reserves or some savings. For the weeding and the trip I was good but savings gone. I was good with sport betting and I did it some times to have fun with my friends. 
Suddenly I start making money from it, with a 10$ bet I make 400$ each day for about a month.
But then it stops and my anxiety made me take the worst decisions ever, I reach the point where I risked all that I have planned, worked and wanted.
My engagement was over my former fiancé, actual ex gf, kicked me out of the house and she keeps our pets and I barely see them now.
My family knew this and lost all trust and love ig that they had on me.
I'm in a self destructive bucle cause I can not forgive myself from what I've done.

To be honest, things have been incredibly tough these last few years. I live in a motel room with my mom, and we don't really have any other friends or family to lean on. It can be quite isolating and it's oftentimes depressing.

I find a lot of comfort and joy in the worlds of anime, manga, and Disney animation. There's just something so magical about those stories, and I love getting lost in them. I also adore Hallmark movies; those warm, feel-good stories always bring a little sunshine into my day. I'd love to connect with people who share those passions, or really anyone who understands what it's like to crave connection.

1jw9lzh,Something far scarier than loneliness,"Okay so I've been lonely almost all my life (22M), I know that's young for a lot of you here but anyway. 

Ever since I became conscious, I felt lonely, as if the world doesn't get me, or maybe I don't get the world. It's so messy, people don't even seem real, some feel so deeply confusing. I don't understand them, what they do or why they do it. 

Over time this has caused me to be quite the misanthropic person.

I don't hate poeple, I just don't understand them. I see people going on their bikes harassing girls and I'm like why??

I see people in their 30s acting 12, are those who I'm supposed to look up to?

I see grown adults talk behind each others backs and create unnecessary drama while they claim maturity but somehow fail to see that maturity requires face to face conversations and a little more thinking, which seems they lack.

I see women deceiving nice men just because they can, and the other way around too. Men deceiving nice (as in personality) women just because they can. Which causes a repeated cycle that leaves everyone preying on each other because they feel ""hurt"" and magically the only way to stop it is to hurt others, as in to break even.

What kind of logic is that... Honestly I hate it.

I feel weird...

I don't claim superiority, but sometimes I feel as if I'm above these things, and sometimes, above people themselves. 

Which is why I'm alone, no friends, no relationship, just there.

I crave talking to someone about anything. I crave those deep convos in the middle of the night looking at the stars and philosophizing. I've never truly had that, and I honestly think I never will.

We occasionally do it at home, especially when it's summer, but they don't get me. I don't just wanna talk. 

I want our souls to talk.

I crave it. 

I crave it.

I crave talking. 

I crave talking, not those random talks, but real ones. 

To meet someone and talk for hours and hours about life and everything. 

While some go and dare to seek lavish things like yachts and businesses. 

I dream of talking...

It's so ironic.

I dream of having a family of my own, of having a little business of my own, of being married, of being loved. 

Yes I dream of being loved by a woman. It's gotten to the point that I can picture myself becoming a millionaire more than me being loved.


How does that make you feel if you're reading this and you're taking your relationship for granted?

I get it. ""You're still young and you have plenty of life left"" 

But what if that life is empty of what makes life ""life"" ?

I've known women in the past, and all they do is deceive me. 

I don't claim to be an ""angel"", but I'm not the ""devil"" either. I'm not a bad person, yet I get treated like an enemy. 

Honestly, I don't even know if I could ever look at women the same again. I recently got out of a relationship that I thought was going well (no that doesn't explain my view on women, it's something I've been thinking about way before, the breakup just confirmed it more and more). 

All this to say that I've been getting incredible doses of loneliness that I think I overdosed to the point I'm not worried about it anymore, I'm worried about the enormous void in my heart. 

When I look at myself, all I see is emptiness. I can't love myself, but I can't hate myself to death either. 

Honestly, I never knew there was such a thing that's far scarier than loneliness.

When you feel lonely, you want someone. It's like a like a garden, you're looking for people to watch it, to admire it. Or like a painting of yours to be seen, to be talked about, or even talked to...

But now, it's like I have this huge hole, that no matter how much I try to fill it, it just gets bigger and bigger to the point even loneliness doesn't come close. 

When you're lonely, you're still on earth. But when you feel this void, it's like you're in space. No person is around, and it would require far more work to get back down, perhaps work that would kill you on your way back. 

I never l knew this existed, I don't know if people feel this, or if you, the person who's reading this, felt it before. 

It's weird...

It's like there's something, but that something is just nothing...

Is this nihilism? 

Maybe...

I remember watching Monster (the anime) and seeing how Johan Liebert was behaving, it didn't make any sense but if he was more empty than me, to the point of losing touch with reality, I guess I get it. 

There was no meaning for him, he was just doing what he wanted to do. 

The only difference is that he's a genius, the best I guess. With an ability to manipulate people as if they were his toys, and ofc enough courage to control a whole undergound world.

I have neither the intelligence nor the courage lol.

I don't know if that makes sense. 

But I don't care. I don't want to die, but I don't see how I'm living either. 

I decided to pursue money, at least having a few things around will keep me company. I will spend the next years working on that. 

When it comes to relationships, I know that won't happen. 

How am I certain? 

Because I wouldn't be with someone who's as empty as I am and I wouldn't let someone be with me for that exact purpose. 

To be honest, I have never met a single woman that truly understood me, or at least tried to, or at least showed signs that she can. 

It's like all they want is to take, and I get it.

We're meant to provide, but a little understanding would make such a huge difference. 

Anyway...

All I'm gonna do now is write ( I'm a writer and I write substack articles), work on my projects, maybe pursue a PhD for the next couple of years if I'm lucky. Because I like research and the academic world (I'm not made to be an employee, I'd just end it at that point).

That's it I guess.

I imagine I would one day return to an empty home, an empty life. 

But that's okay. I want to make the people around me happy. My parents, my siblings, I want the best for them and I'll try to do it. 

Money doesn't really matter that much when it's your soul that is slowly getting pulled away. I really wish it hadn't come to this. 

I wish there is a way to be lonely and not this empty. 

I would rather be alone in a forest, than be somewhere with no forest at all. 

At least there you could meet someone from time to time. 

That was long, and if you made it here. Just know that it's better to feel lonely than to be empty. 

Take it from someone who spent 7 years being lonely.

If you're lonely, enjoy it. 

It's peaceful, but when it's empty, there's nothing to be peaceful about. 

You're just there...

1jw562j,The epitome of loneliness: posted this to relationship advice and got no reponse,"21M straight, I'm a super liberal, kind of autistic guy in a smallish super conservative city.

I didn't do too much better in a liberal city.

Maybe my expectations are too high? But that doesn't explain absolutely no one wanting me. It's not like there's a bunch of girls who showed interest that I rejected. Zero means zero.

I feel like the issue has to be my personality. I'm 5'9 but that's not too short for women I don't think. I'm actually dummy toned, not bad size muscle, crazy chest muscles. I've never gotten an IQ test but based on academic performance and my mom and dad's IQ I'm likely over 140.

I work construction which is a weird direction for someone with my academic achievement but college is expensive and I like driving truck. I'm also a musician with many albums released. I've mewed 24/7 since age 15 so I have a pretty good facial structure.

Sorry if this feels like a dating profile, just trying to give the quickest glance at my whole person. The younger I was, the better success I had dating. It seems like my dating prime was when I was 16. Now I haven't had anyone for over a year. I heard autism gets worse with age.

I have a good male friend finally, we work out together and make music and drive around. Super nice guy. A lot of guys look down on me or bully me so the fact that he doesn't means the world to me. I did dating apps a lot, hard pass, its just a money drain scam. I go to the club every other week. Nobody there wants anything to do with me.

Girl after girl is willing to let me pursue them but won't reciprocate any affection, I think because they never wanted me. This makes me give up quickly, because who would go for that? It was a no from the start. Meanwhile I watch them all act super into my friend. He's more energetic and 2 inches taller. I'm more of a calm type. He makes it clear he's taken. He has a slightly better jawline.

I've tried putting off a party animal vibe, I've tried just acting like my core introvert self. I've tried peacocking with my outfits, I've tried dressing plain.

I have my own home and a good car. I take my vitamins and protein. I eat healthy.

I have this weird feeling that despite any positive characteristics, no girl is capable of being attracted to me. I feel like I don't exist. I just wish someone was attracted to me, anyone. An emotional connection would be nice, but the dating world for me has become a 0. Not anyone. So standards are plummeting. Maybe I'm texting wrong or talking wrong or standing wrong? I usually stand fully upright, good posture, helps with mewing.

Maybe I'm longwinded. This post is evidence. Anyways, I try to uplift people and I don't say mean things ever. I put a lot of effort into making people feel happy or comfortable. But whether I've gotten to know the girl or she's just glanced at me for the first time, the reaction is the same - absolutely no attraction. But anyways, I've given all the information that's reasonable to give. Have at me. What in the heck am I doing wrong?

1jvnja4,Painful loneliness,"Hey..

I'm 25, and feeling so overwhelmed with loneliness right now I feel like I could tear my skin apart. So maybe if I talk about it I wont feel so alone. 

I've always grown up as the second friend, never anyones best friend.. never thought about when they invited people to parties.. I was always just there. Unfortunately my mother married a military man when I was 12 (added context my father never wanted me because I was a girl, he fought for custody of my brothers and left me alone) and we moved around through the rest of my middle and high school years. This made it worse as I didn't even try to make friends knowing I'd be leaving. 

I thought things picked up when I was 18. I made a really good friend, we went out constantly to parties and explored the state together. I also met my ex, which was another friendship of course. Neither of those friendships worked out. I haven't had a single friend since, well except a brief friend I made this summer who ghosted me all of a sudden.

7 years without friends. 7 years without anyone to talk to, to connect with, to share interests with. I have tried to make friends in this time - I tried bumble BFF, I tried going out, I tried even making friends with coworkers. I feel almost broken, no one wants to talk to me. 

My family despises me, and the worst part is I live with them lol. They don't even talk to me anymore, I just get ignored. 

Every night I just sit here. Sometimes I cry, sometimes I pace back and forth.. even both. The pain hurts so bad that I want to rip my skin off to find the pain. I try to watch reels, or read, or do anything else but it never works. I just want human connection, even if it's digital.

Im (f18) who used to post semi often here and on the lonely reddits. And now I'm back, I do have a friend irl (whooooo!) but I'm still really lonely, and I don't know why, honestly I'm my onlsn worst enemy.

When I make friends I fall in love, which is such a dumb as shit problem to have, that's not a problem for my irl friend though, he's gay so..yea. I did make a really good friend here once he was Australian, and so funny and kind. He'd send me little videos of his life and Christ his voice, so nice and relaxing. That ended though, and it was completely my fault, I ran away and stopped talking to him because I started to fall in love and he had a girlfriend, plus I don't think i ultimately would of been a good thing in his life..I'm a really unstable person, right now I'm more stable than ever so I can't help but wish I was not a fucked up mess back then. I mis his letters, well they were texts but we called them letters because they were sooo long..he also was very sweet about my autism which was so nice. My username is also a nickname he gave me, well the first part, cute huh?

I don't really have a right to miss him though, I'm the one who left.. anyway.

I was doing some painting, and watching videos then I can't tell what got me to do it, but I decided to start paying attention to the video and it was some story about a guy who went missing under odd circumstance, but it focused a lot on his girlfriend and how much they loved each other  and how she's never given up over so many years, and I wanted to see the comments and it was full of people telling their own love stories or at minimum their friends and family caring about them.. it's sweet but it also made me mad, at myself at least.

Im someone who is the picture of desperate, and my picker is broken, I fall fast and usually for someone shitty, if they aren't shitty they're out of reach, I'm mad because I'll never have that sweet love story, because it's like I'm allergic to letting myself go slow and feel someone out first.. ugh, I hate this feeling.",Zoebot-3000,4,10,No Flair,well hiagain well hiagain im f used post semi often lonely reddits im back friend irl whooooo im still really lonely dont know honestly im onlsn worst enemy make friend fall love dumb shit problem thats problem irl friend though he gay soyea make really good friend australian funny kind hed send little video life christ voice nice relaxing ended though completely fault ran away stopped talking started fall love girlfriend plus dont think ultimately would good thing lifeim really unstable person right im stable ever cant help wish fucked mess back mi letter well text called letter sooo longhe also sweet autism nice username also nickname gave well first part cute huh dont really right miss though im one left anyway painting watching video cant tell got decided start paying attention video story guy went missing odd circumstance focused lot girlfriend much loved shes never given many year wanted see comment full people telling love story minimum friend family caring sweet also made mad least im someone picture desperate picker broken fall fast usually someone shitty arent shitty theyre reach im mad ill never sweet love story like im allergic letting go slow feel someone first ugh hate feeling,0.06217857142857144,0.5889285714285714

My wife is no better. She will spend all the time she's awake doing chores, (don't worry, I do chores too) and then when she's done she goes to bed. I also want a clean house, but I want time with my wife more. Cleaning the fridge every week is more important than spending time with me I guess. Sometimes she'll come sit near me when I watch TV, but then she'll either be texting friends the whole time, or go to sleep. Or she'll get up to go to bed because she's so tired, only to spend the next several hours awake in the bedroom, making it feel like she just didn't want to spend time with me.

1js1ji2,Warning from a lonely boy  Don't let high standards & 'classiness' isolate you.,"Hey everyone,

Posting this from my bed alone I'm currently doing an internship. From the outside, things probably look fine – student, intern, living independently. But honestly, I'm incredibly lonely most of the time. I miss my college days and friends constantly, but I hate phone calls, video calls feel forced... I crave real, physical presence, which is hard to come by.

And I've realised a lot of this loneliness is my own damn fault, stemming from how I tried to build myself.

I got really into studying human behaviour, trying always to be logical, ethical, moral, and ""classy."" I thought being the ""perfect kid"" who never did anything wrong or ""cringe"" was the way to be. I believed silence was strength, that women liked the ""classy, silent man,"" all that stuff.

Here's the trap I fell into, and I'm warning anyone, especially if you're younger, NOT to do this:

1. Trying to be perfectly logical and classy meant suppressing huge parts of myself. My spontaneity, my vulnerabilities, the silly or ""cringe"" stuff that makes us human. I see people I used to call ""cringe"" living freely and seeming genuinely happier. Connection happens in shared imperfection, not curated perfection. All my rules just built walls.
2. I overthink everything. ""What will they think?"" ""Is this classy enough?"" ""Am I being logical?"" It's exhausting and stops me from just being in social situations or even posting simple things online (like playing cricket) because my self-esteem is shot. I feel like I don't deserve to share because I haven't met my own impossible standards.
3. The ""Classy/Silent"" Myth: This stuff might work if you're already super successful and established. But when you're young, trying to build connections and find your way? It's poison. You need to express yourself, share experiences, be a bit vulnerable. That's how bonds form. Silence just breeds more loneliness.

And now, making friends feels almost impossible:

• First, there's my barrier against online/phone stuff. I need that physical interaction, which is already harder to find after college.

• Second, because of my mindset, I subconsciously look for friends who are also hyper-logical, ""classy,"" and maybe a bit reserved. That's a tiny pool of people!

• Third, even if I meet someone potentially cool, I'm so stuck in my head and my ""rules"" that I don't really open up or bond easily. A friendship only happens if the other person is incredibly persistent and happens to be very similar to me, which is super rare.

My plea to anyone reading this who sees themselves in this:

Please, please try to change NOW. Don't wait. It only gets harder to unlearn these patterns. Let yourself be ""cringe."" Express yourself. It's okay to be imperfect, to be silly, to not always be logical or classy. Those things you suppress are probably the parts that will actually connect you to others.

Perfection is a bogus idea. It doesn't exist. Often, the people pushing you to be ""perfect"" are deeply imperfect themselves. And honestly, if someone genuinely thinks they are perfect, that's pretty solid proof they're not – because real growth involves knowing you're flawed.

Don't end up lonely in your seemingly ""fine"" life because you were too busy trying to be an idea instead of a person.

Hope this helps someone avoid this path. It's a lonely one.

A very angry stomach bug woke me up at four in the morning. Two hours later, I got up to get ready for work, stomach bug still very much in tow. I spent another eight hours at the call center job that rakes my soul over a bed of coals, then return to the motel room I share with my mom.

She made it very clear to me that nothing I went through today mattered in the slightest, then went to sleep. And off again I go to work tomorrow.

With no family members or friends to offer any bit of comfort, in environments that often exhaust me, I often find myself longing for sleep. At the end of the day, all I want

1joqpjo,Moving away,"Do you think changing scenery or moving would change the feeling of loneliness? 

15 years ago I emigrated from South America to Europe. My dream was to live in my fathers hometown on a small island where he was born and reconnect with his extended family. I wanted to belong there and identify being from there. 
Things didn’t really work out because I had problems in my job where I faced severe workplace bullying that gave me PTSD and burnout and I basically ended up in therapy for 2 years trying to overcome the grief of losing that life plan. I had to move to a big city on the mainland where I thrived professionally, got the mental help I needed and did achieve every aspect of my professional life. However, city people can be cold and difficult to break in. Even though, I do have a good relationship with the people here, I feel city connections are empty and after the pandemic, the loneliness and empty feeling got worse. 
The fact that I’ve never had a meaningful relationship with a man in my life is probably the biggest pain I have to endure. It hurts my soul, and even though I’ve tried to overcome it with a myriad of activities and hobbies, I cannot get over it. 
I think last June, the loneliness got worse. I tried even getting into extreme sports to get a dopamine hit, since Im now on GLP-1s and I can’t even self medicate with food anymore because I literally feel no hunger and can’t even get pleasure from even eating my favorite foods anymore. The anxiety combined with Ozempic makes food taste like cardboard. Men want me of course, just to fk me. Nobody wants to be part of life despite working on myself, taking care of myself, working out and being successful- turns out maybe I’m too much for a man. 
I got an idea into my head 2 months ago that maybe I should transfer and try again to build a life on my fathers hometown, to be with family. People are more open there, being a small  and all and the weather is super nice and sunny year round. Even though, that place hurt me in the past; I’m successful now- I’m stronger professionally.

1jolxxy,"Getting bent out of shape over clerks not saying ""hello""","So, I don't have many friends. The ones I do have maybe an hour a week to talk to me. I live alone, and I work in an IT job where I set in a room for eight hours a day, alone. I work alone 75% of the time. I am an extravert. I like to talk, and listen, especially about stimulating topics. I live in Detroit metro area.. I moved her when I was 21 and have never really been able to make friends in this extremely inhospitable city. It's crazy, people go out of their way to make sure other people do not talk to them, younger people are the worst at this. In spite of this situation, I'm generally really effective in social situations, but no one can really dance by themselves, and if you're going to try to talk to strangers you have to brace yourself for a lot of rejection.  
If I were my old self, having at least one or two people to talk to every few days I really would not mind people being rude to my attempts to reach out. Sadly, when I got 48 hours without talking to anyone at all and then I try to say Hi to someone who blows me off, it's insane how much it effects me. I know it's silly. I know I should get over it, but for some reason my subconscious is totally rocked to the core. I figured out, it's because that one conversation takes on such high stakes. Since they're the only person I'm going to talk to that day my mind begins to believe that they're really the only person in the world and they just rejected me. This causes me to think I need to rethink everything about the situation and that I've done something wrong. It's all simply because I'm trying to say hi to some people who does not even consider it normal to say hi to people. While, to be fair, clerks should ALWAYS say 'hi' to people, but expecting that ist just another thing to get under your skin.  
It happened to me at the gym tonight, and it bothered me for hours. I became too sad to do my workout. I kept feeling pathetic for allowing it to bother me so much, but when you're alone 95% of the time it's really hard to not stuck in your head.

1joc72n,I don’t know what I’m doing wrong,"I feel like I’m destined to be alone. It doesn’t matter how hard I try, no one sticks around. I have no one in my life- no one to talk to, no one to laugh with. My phone is so dry, I don’t know why I bother having one. I don’t know what’s so awful about me that means that nobody wants to even be associated with me. 

I’m aware that if you look at my profile and the posts that are on there, I come across as an unhappy and miserable person, but I’m not always like that. I use Reddit to try and express my emotions in a healthy way because I have no one to talk to. When I’m having general conversations with people, I’m much more upbeat. I try my best to take an interest and ask questions to keep the conversation going. I’m always polite, and especially when messaging someone, I’m never pushy about getting a reply. I try to treat the person I’m talking to the way I wish someone would treat me. 

I can’t seem to even keep internet friends. I met someone on this subreddit and we started talking when they sent me a message after seeing one of my posts. We instantly hit it off and really related to one another. I finally felt understood by someone. We talked for almost a year, then suddenly, they stopped talking to me. I hadn’t said anything that was rude or upsetting- we were just in the middle of a conversation. I tried contacting them on Reddit, discord, even their phone number they had given me, but it’s as if they’d vanished. I understand that people have things going on in their lives, but I thought they cared enough about me to have at least said something, even if it was that they didn’t want to be friends anymore. 

There was someone else who I met online that I also seemed to click with. Again, I spent hours talking to them, and really put the effort in, only for them to stop replying a couple of months back. I just wish people wouldn’t get my hopes up. They even said how much they were looking forward to getting to know me better, and that they enjoyed talking to me. I don’t like when people say things like that when they clearly don’t mean it, because it really messes with my head. I know I have to keep putting myself out there to give myself a fighting chance to meet new people, but there’s only so much I can take. The whole process is draining. I don’t want to miss an opportunity due to past experiences not being great, but I don’t want to spend so much time on someone again if they’re just going to ghost me. 

I feel so unwanted and insignificant. I just want to be important to someone, to be wanted, for someone to care so much that they would miss me if I wasn’t around. If I disappeared right now, no one would probably notice, let alone be bothered. I have so much love and time to give to someone, but no one wants anything to do with me.

1jo3qtn,The past 6 months have been a living nightmare.,"I don’t know what I have done to deserve what has happened in the past 6 months. 

To kick it off, not even 3 days out of a week long hospital stay, my fiancé of 6 years left me without warning. All 4 of my (now ex) best friends left with him. I haven’t heard from any of them since October. 
Don’t get me wrong, I was (and kinda still am) devastated by the break up but what hurts more is the fact that all of my friends left me too. 

I have been nothing but supportive, kind, caring, selfless to them. Gave them the last of my money if they asked. I gave one of them a bed to sleep on when times were rough. And they all up and left. 

To add on to this, after the split, I bloomed a friendship with someone from high school and their wife. Things were great for a few months. We would talk every day, I’d stay over, help look after their baby. And now, they don’t talk to me at all. 
All I get from them are blank mass-sent snapchats of the doorframe with the date. 
I get one word responses to any messages I send. They were in hospital a few days ago and I replied to their story wishing them well. 

I’m in hospital at the moment and I did the same as they did - posted it on my Snapchat story. They left me on read. No efforts to contact me at all. And the cherry on top is the fact that I had a week long stay in the hospital (they were aware) and not once did they ever ask how I was or at least contact me. 

I am so terrified of abandonment. It is my biggest fear and in the past 6 months I have lost 7 people. 7 people I thought were my friends. 

I have 1 remaining friend and I am terrified I’ll drive her away or she will get bored of me. I’m so damn lonely.

1jo2032,This is like a never ending Trial,"This is a long one if you don't like stories then move on to the next post.

For the past 7 years now, I've been extremely lonely and tried looking for Friends (more specifically females) to try and subside this insanity of being alone for so long as well as to get away from the toxic masculinity that is my friend group, I probably should just get rid of them, but I only keep them for the competition, but aside from that, I have made about what 5 or 6 female friends, one of them willing to date me (not really) but it didn't even lasted a day before she just straight up ghosted me, I built so much trust with her and thought I made a break through and got out of this loneliness, but that was quickly shot down, it ended up making me spiral so much I called 988 because for the past 7 years I've been treated like garbage, tossed around, teased, trolled, and just overall bullied, I thought my little relationship I had was my escape but when she ghosted me, it broke me, I couldn't break free from my problems, I didn't know how to handle it properly, but I guess since I didn't do anything irrational yet, I guess there's more to my life that's not over yet. 

After I had collected myself, I started to talk to myself and start making a plan with my love life, no more shall I make female friends online, if I want to make friends with women I do so in the real world, I thought if I could make friends with them online, I'd get my word out, that I feel like I'm running out of time, and that in hopes they tell their friends about me, and that someone who is actually interested will contact me, but if all I do is get my feelings hurt more by getting blocked, but I don't need that now, I'll try talking to women in the real world, and if none of them want to be with me, then I'll create a dating profile when I'm like 30 or 40, And if no luck there, I'm gonna die old, lonely, and a virgin a most.
Speaking of which I also have gotten rid of any intimate desires, I won't ask my soon to be girlfriend, whenever that may be, I won't ask them to do anything that requires us to be nude for it, and yes that means showering, I'll continue being a virgin until they ask me, ""Why"". 

You know the crazy thing is, I don't mind becoming a Step father in the future when I'm 30 or 40, as long as I have the money, I won't mind helping a woman take care of her kids, just as long as I get the same love and appreciation, the intimate matter is another situation that I'll need to figure out myself, it's really a matter of if they are willing to do it, and if my ego will allow me to succumb to the fact that I'm gonna be intimate with a woman the same age as me but as a mother and not a virgin. Weather they even want to do it with me will cause certain implications, first off the fact that if they already have kids makes me not want to do it, I wouldn't want to add more, but at the same time, I'd also be missing out. Then again I've already accepted my fate of never being able to share my first time with someone, so it's not like I'll hold it against anyone for not letting me enjoy something as pleasurable, but rather I'm just disappointed that I won't know if I'll ever be able to enjoy it in the afterlife.

1jmzqlr,no one looks me in the eye,"info : 25M, living quite far from my family, studying a Master's program. I do not want to get into much of my past just that i can count one person i truly consider my close friend and don't really have a strong or good bond with my parents.

Recent events that snapped something in me: few times smoking in public with my classmate / after drinking a random stranger usually comes up to borrow a cigarette but none of them ask me or look me in the eye when its usually me who gives one to them. they look at my classmate and thank him instead and go on.

Said classmate and I were getting a couple of beers last week and nothing of note was said, he told me he'd be back in 10 mins and just left me there , for some reason i waited for over an hour and looked around the bar thinking he might have passed out drunk somewhere- only for him to have headed to another bar to get beers with other friends and head home.

None of the girls in class look me in the eye for more than a second-if that. i just say hi / hello and somehow they seem to get on edge ? maybe i'm overthinking.

It could be that i have a bland personality- no strong opinions ,plain clothes, no interesting hobbies that are in common with the people i know from class. I am fairly average looking and presentable most days.

  
I realized I should just come to terms with not being a part of anyone's life...I am closer now to a stray dog - looking for anyone who can look me in the eye feed me a small crumb of validation that i exist as a fellow person and am worthy of a normal conversation. and that is brewing anger in my mind - on myself; That I am weak enough to be put in a situation like this.

1jmw53e,I am never chosen,"I’ve never been in a relationship and I’m 35. I always thought it was because of my looks and my weight struggles. 3 years ago, I lost weight and glowed up, and I’m still not being chosen. I’m still single despite getting myself out there; dating apps, blind dates, speed dating, running clubs, hiking groups, joining a CrossFit gym since there are a lot of guys going there, recently getting into surfing since you’re supposed to meet a lot of people on surfing camps. All I’ve had were gut wrenching situationships, a string of first dates that never happen again and a lot of ghosting. I try being very selective about whom I choose to sleep with, and I really have to be very into the guy for me to agree access to my body; so I even went an entire year being celibate because I didn’t meet anyone interesting enough. 

That being said, my heart right now is full of sorrow over the last failed attempt to stop my loneliness. 13 years ago I used to live on an island, where I was doing my residency program. One of my superiors who was like 20 years my senior, I guess I had a little crush on him, that never went anywhere because he was married at the time and because I had very low self esteem at the time and saw him as unobtainable. For different struggles I was having at my job, I was forced to transfer to the mainland and rebuild my life there, where I have been living in a big city for the last 10 years. I thrived there, I overcame my professional issues, I got promoted and became very successful. I even glowed up and lost weight. I do feel attractive sometimes, but I rely on male attention and validation, so sometimes I don’t feel beautiful enough. 2 months ago, I found this man on Instagram. We started talking and I found out he is divorced now, and told me I look gorgeous and sexy. Our interactions quickly became very sexual and I eventually started catching feelings for this man. We would video chat sometimes. I decided to get on a plane and see my family (who live there), and obviously see him. Yesterday he took me out to a fancy place, ordered the most expensive wine, payed for the meal without me noticing it, took me on his Mercedes to his house. We had sex. But he later tells me he is starting to date someone whom he really likes and who doesn’t even live there, but in another continent and who will eventually move there. It tore me apart as I started developing feelings for this man. For a short moment I felt like a princess, I felt like a goddess, I wanted to pick up my whole life and transfer back and pursue him. And it’s like he says “you’re special, I love you, always have and always will but my mind is somewhere else”. He just didn’t choose me. Why?

1jmo7da,Can't make it on my own any longer,"My (41 F) life in a nutshell:

I grew up in a dysfunctional family with physical and mental abuse. Was bullied at school. Started drinking and taking drugs as a teenager.

In my mid-twenties, I found a spiritual community that helped me out of that lifestyle and a few years later, I left my home country and moved to a place where this community is more active. Lost contact with all of my old friends.

Have always been struggling to fit into society, dropped out of university and got a job but burnt out in my early 30's. Was diagnosed with autism and adhd around that time. Also ended up homeless, was moving around a lot between 2014 and 2018 with no place to rest while also suffering from major depression and serious fatigue. Got no support from my family, they only carried on with mental abuse so I cut off ties with them.

Got disability pension 2018 at the age of 35. Found a decent place to live but also isolated myself totally since then. Was also in a destructive relationship, ended it in late 2019 since he threatened to beat me up and kill me. Then pandemic happened and I got even more isolated.

Left the spiritual community last year since I found out they're a cult; got no real support from them whatsoever, they just manipulated me into thinking that all negative things happening to me are my own fault and result of my past actions, and there was nothing I could do about it and that I was on my own. Got contact with some cult survivor groups and made close friends with one person online. Soon we developed romantic feelings to each other and since a couple of months or so we've been in a long distance relationship. He's been my everything since then but just like me, he suffers from ptsd and has since 10 days or so behaved very weirdly. Isolated from the rest of the world, hardly responding to my messages and when he does, it takes nearly one day or so.

I think I'm having a mental breakdown, I'm nearly suicidal. What's the point of going on with life? It's only been a series of tragedies and I seem to make terrible mistakes all the time. Have zero friends I can rely on and I'm too broken to make it on my own. Thought that me and my boyfriend (or maybe I should consider myself single at this point?) would have supported each other and start a new life together but it seems he's not on the same page anymore. I just can't cope with him disappearing, not giving me any kind of validation or showing any signs that he wants to communicate with me and sort things out. So on top of all this, my heart's also broken now.

After a life like this, how can I carry on without family or friends or anyone to rely on? I just want to give up",DysLexSpaceGoat,2,8,No Flair,cant make longer f life nutshell grew dysfunctional family physical mental abuse bullied school started drinking taking drug teenager midtwenties found spiritual community helped lifestyle year later left home country moved place community active lost contact old friend always struggling fit society dropped university got job burnt early diagnosed autism adhd around time also ended homeless moving around lot place rest also suffering major depression serious fatigue got support family carried mental abuse cut tie got disability pension age found decent place live also isolated totally since also destructive relationship ended late since threatened beat kill pandemic happened got even isolated left spiritual community last year since found theyre cult got real support whatsoever manipulated thinking negative thing happening fault result past action nothing could got contact cult survivor group made close friend one person online soon developed romantic feeling since couple month weve long distance relationship he everything since like suffers ptsd since day behaved weirdly isolated rest world hardly responding message take nearly one day think im mental breakdown im nearly suicidal whats point going life series tragedy seem make terrible mistake time zero friend rely im broken make thought boyfriend maybe consider single point would supported start new life together seems he page anymore cant cope disappearing giving kind validation showing sign want communicate sort thing top heart also broken life like carry without family friend anyone rely want give,-0.06819669913419914,0.40050054112554107

1jlswsi,19m. I don’t have anyone to relate to.,"I’m not good at anything. And it is partly my fault and it partly isn’t. Number one I’m poor as fuck. My family is very very poor. Lower middle class. House looks like shit. But I’m not a tough guy, hood rat anything like that because I grew up in a preppy white neighborhood. Everyone has nice houses while mine looks like a trap house in the middle of the nice neighborhood. I never had nice toys growing up. Never had ps4 or Xbox. It doesn’t matter, I’m not superficial. As a kid I was draw and make cut outs and use newspaper to make my own toys. I’m decently intelligent, but I act like a tard. Why? I have anxiety an ocd diagnosed, but I also VERY VERY likely have adhd. Very likely as in I was in denial for the longest time, and my parents didn’t want to get me tested and I was supposed to get tested but I never did. People with adhd literally tell me I have adhd. I have almost every key mark symptom. Don’t even want to get tested atp bc for some reason every other loser who has it gate keeps it. It’s severe if i do have it. Well that sucks, my parents don’t believe in it, I’m already past Highschool so there’s little benefit in getting aid now, and I did decent in Highschool but struggling my ass off now and there’s little I can do about it. It keeps me up at night at times. Mind wont shut up. If it’s not that it’s my ocd or anxiety giving me a tuff time. If it’s not that THEN ITS MY DUST MITE ALLEGY AND ASTHMA, WHCIH LITERALLY MAKES IT HARD TO BREATHE, SLEEP, AND FOCUS ON TOP OF ALL THAT. Well at least I can eat what I want right? Wrong. I have gut issues. Like really bad. I suspect I have IBS but again never got diagnosed because my luck with things in general is just not great and one of those things is getting help I need. Maybe the world just doesn’t care for me. No matter how many other people I help it doesn’t seem to come back to me. People automatically are aggressive towards me. No matter how big or small. So I struggle to think, focus, eat, rest, properly perhaps I’m gifted in some other aspect? Athletics? I love sports. Too bad I suck at almost everything athletic. I’ve never been fast. Never. Have horrible stamina. Assume both of that is from asthma. My speed and stamina have improved REALLY dramatically since a child and I’m grateful. I guess at this point I’m slightly above average if anything but that’s because I’m a young male and the world is majority metabolically unhealthy. My genetics aren’t great for lifting or athletics. I have a very lanky frame, and I am skinny fat. I have great agility and jumping power though, I’m greatful for that but if I was healthy I would be even better. You’d think I was athletic looking at me but I hate being such a disappointment. My catching abilities are also subpar. And don’t get me started on throwing. One thing I was blessed with is looks. Sort of. I have decent facial features, and my face holds very little fat and is quite robust. But all this does is make me attention hungry and self obsessed because it’s one of the few good things in my life. Or was. I have auto immune condition that not only fqs up my skin but now is affecting my hair. My hair use to give me tips at the drive though. I was bullied as a kid for being ulgy so when I was getting praised all of a sudden it felt insanely good. Now it’s Thinner all over. Think it’s affecting my facial hair too. My skin use to be great now it’s uneven, blemished, has acne scars, ACTUAL scars, and I have had multitide of issues in the past like whiteheads, keratosis pilaris, eczema you name it. Right now I have clogged inner sweat glands on my thighs. Gross. My penis I think is probably below average. The acid reflex and probably increased acidity from difficulty breathing while I sleep makes my teeth naturally yellow. I had fqed teeth as a child and I got braces but they took so long an never finished the job so now I have a gap between one of my teeth and my canine so I look like a pirate. And although I said I have good looks, I’m slightly above average at best. I’m by no means some Sean o pry or anything like that. I’m also a dark skinned, curly haired Indian. And I have all these health issues so young, plus fqed teeth so now it doesn’t matter if a girl checks me, it’s almost basically clips. And because I’m south Asian, but dark skinned male with curly hair I’m hated on by literally every race. White, black my own, you name it. Can’t name a single group of people or country whre I feel like I’d belong and get appreciated by the people. Def not my ethnic country Bangladesh and prob not the USA. I was a class clown growing up so epople sort of like me for that but nobody takes my feeling seriously at the same time. And like I said, my ethnic origin and phenotype may not be ideal but I got to look good for like a few years and now (whole still in my youth) I barely get to experience that now. I have nothing redeemable at this point. My family hates me. They have yelled at me constantly my whole life. I’m horrible ways. And I’m a freaking baby. I wish so much I was a brave, tough non anxious man. So much so. My mom and dad hate each other but never divorced because of culture. Verbal and physical violence towards me, and each other was so common growing up. I in general don’t succeed in things I’m passionate about. I was religious from 13-17 to cope with all my stress in life. Islamic. Now I’m starting to let go of thst too. I was never raised religious , I took it upon my self. My dad literally doesn’t even like it. He constantly ridicules me and hates me for being religious. How unlucky am i, I’m the only one with an ethnic dad who dislikes that his son is religious? The religion he basically chose FOR ME. All he does is talk about grades and talk down on me and my mom. Back to my looks I’m much taller than him. One of the few good things in my life is my height but I honestly don’t care mcuh for it. My sister hates me too. She has anger issues and my parents can barely handle her. Yet they bought her a car. And not me even though I was and still am in college and full time employed. I have this ridiculously annoying cousin who can’t mind her own busienss for her life who immigrated here and lives with us. 30 year old child. Well she as gone.. WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE, and now that I dropped out and am attending university near my house she back..my life bro. My job pays below minimum wage and biweekly yet I love it. It’s one of the few escape I have. I don’t play video games much bc of lack of access, proper education and because I’m not great at those either. All these people talking about money doesn’t buy happiness, or how they are falling apart because of a heartbreak and yet I can barely struggle to enjoy even the little pleasures in life and for what reason? What wrong have I done? I’m not even superficial never have been all I wanted was a chance and I never got it? I don’t even have the balls to take my own pathetic life. I hate natural selection for ignoring all my ancestors and somehow making a mess like me. I use to be scared of dying in my sleep, but if I could be guaranteed heaven in the afterlife I’d take it in a heartbeat. So tired of living my life. I’m sorry for this rant but I have to let all this out. There are a dozen or more other things I could have listed.

For years, I had this belief that one day I would find love but after that delusion started fading away a couple of years ago, I've never been the same and slowly descending. That delusion kept my hopes up my whole life when I got my heart broken each time.

1jjsy9x,Lonely for Seemingly No Reason,"Hallo hallo!

So I kind of just want to vent out my feelings and maybe I can be lonely with all of you.

Basically, I feel lonely despite seeming like I have a lot of friends. It's a weird feeling for me because I heard this is something extroverts experience. Maybe I became an extrovert in college, I don't know, but I essentially know a lot of people to the point that people I seemingly don't know say hi to me in the hallways.

It might seem like I'm so lucky to have so many friends and acquaintances, but it feels like I'm all alone in a crowded room. They know of me, but they don't know me, and when I want to deepen the relationship, I end up pushing people away. I had people telling me I'm too much. Someone told me they can handle me online, but they can't stand me in real life. It probably has something to do with me being bipolar. I'm like a puppy on rollerskates and the only people I feel understood by are people with ADHD (not even people with bipolar disorder), but even then, I don't have a lot of interests in common with the people I know with ADHD.

I also have a best friend, but she's hanging out more with her other friends. I feel like she prefers to be with them. I kind of feel like I'm lagging behind. We're also drifting apart in terms of our interests, so that probably contributes to why she'd rather hang out with other people.

I kind of just want to be friends with people with the same interests as me \*and\* who will put in as much effort as I give. My relationships tend to be one-sided. I keep getting hurt because I keep investing in people who won't give me anything back. And it's not like I go to these relationships expecting to be showered with everything under the sun. Even just a small ""hello"", unprompted; an invite to call on Discord and talk about the most mundane things; an invite to play games or watch shows; maybe talk about our thoughts and feelings sometimes, then laugh at a meme the next second. I want someone who is kind to me because they like spending time with me and aren't there to get something out of me or exploit my desire for a connection. I just want a friend, but I feel like all I am is an afterthought.

But I will say, for anyone who feels like anything I said resonates with them, I'm still optimistic. Maybe not today or tomorrow, but we will find our people. Just be careful not to fall down a rabbit hole of misery and bitterness. It’s easy to fall into spaces that reinforce negativity, where bitterness and resentment fester rather than heal. As much as I like the internet, for example, I know it is filled with echo chambers that can make us feel temporarily validated but ultimately trap us in cycles of self-doubt and cynicism.

Remember, you are not unlovable. You are not ugly. You are not unworthy. We all need love, and we can find the connection we desperately crave. We just need to look at the right places. The world is vast, and there are people out there who will see us for who we are—flaws and all—and embrace us wholeheartedly. It may take time, and it may require stepping outside our comfort zones, but meaningful relationships are possible. I've seen it happen, I felt it once before, and you can too. No matter how lonely or lost we feel, we are not beyond love. We are not invisible. Everyone needs and deserves connection. Take care of yourself until the time comes. Exercise, eat healthy, sleep well, go to a therapist, and indulge in your hobbies. We got this.

I’ve never been in a relationship before because Im way too nervous to talk to a girl and I usually don’t know what to say.

Sometimes it helps me to feel not so lonely and other times it makes me even more depressed because they are not real and I think that even if they were I would never have a chance. I feel like I’m also doing this to myself because I do not feel capable of being loved romantically by someone else but I’m also terrified of dying alone.

What struck me is that this kind of use shares traits with addiction: cravings, disrupting daily life, and not being able to stop even when it’s hurting you. These individuals also reported worse depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts.

It’s not about saying “just quit social media” - for some, it’s a lifeline. But it made me wonder:

1jjhyj9,Seeking excitement in depression,"Well loneliness isn't about a few or no people being around you, sometimes its noone waiting for you, asking you about your day, caring about your achievements,  or even, thinking your hobbies and goals are stupid! I could have a few people around me but I prefer loneliness over friends who makes me anxious,  i always choose self respect and peace over toxic relationships so thats why I'm lonely, I've experienced good friendships and bad ones, but all of them has ended somehow wich Is fine! 
It's difficult to maintain self love when you're not supported,  still I'm really grateful for supports that I've got in life, but people aren't our objects we cant force them or beg them for attention. so they come and go , or they may take time away on their own, being busy with life, self discovery, enjoying other people's company. For a while or forever. 
As an 18 year old girl I feel like I need to glow, share and receive, explore and talk to people without being stressed. Having friends who care about me and i care about them. But I've been struggling to find a friend or a group of friends who can make me feel more supported and less isolated. Specially in this difficult days of getting ready for important life changing exams and studying for 12 hours a day!

1jitl4s,Cartoons are nice.,"I apologise for suddenly posting this. I am not sure if what I am feeling is loneliness or something else entirely, so I would like for anyone that is willing to read the entire length of my emotional odyssey know that I appreciate your effort, and thanks for reading. Disclaimer, my English is not that good, it's not my first language, so I apologise again.

I suppose, I'll start from the beginning, but before that, a bit about myself. I am 19, barely an adult, I know that at that age, emotions aren't supposed to be ""real"" or so they say. I was born into a ""toxic"" family, by my definition they are toxic, but I know others who would say that they aren't toxic at all.

When I was a kid, I had little to no friends. I can't remember much, but what I do know is that I never left my house to play with friends like a ""normal"" child (I don't really know what constitutes as normalcy) my parents never let me play with neighbour kids because to them ""we are not at their level"". So I spent most of my days watching cartoons at home. Time pass by and as I grew from kindergarten to elemantary, I never really had friends that I could talk to after class. My parents were always at work, and my brother lives with my grandparents. So I spent more time watching cartoons. My family always made fun of me when I watch cartoons, because to them I don't have a life. However, when I tried new things like drawing and writing, all that they did was treated what I made like a disappointment, never once did I get a nice feedback, it was always, ""it's okay"" and then I will find the paper in the trash. Maybe that was normal and I'm just weak.

Skip by a few more years, I am in highschool, I for once found friends that I can talk with after school (through discord mostly), but as the years go by, we went astray, switching schools didn't help too. The next 1 and a half year of school was great, I had a few friends none were ever friend friend (if you get what I mean), but I had friends. That all changed when I left school though. After graduation I worked a bit, never really had a human connection that left me feeling for more. It was always the connection where I won't be able to talk to them outside of work hours. Even with my effort to be friendly with everyone, no one seem to let me be a friend. 2 years later, here I am, almost ending my first year of college. I have friends, but they have better friends, people that they rather spend time with. At every run for the corner, I will always be the backup friend, always the guy they call when they need me, and never when they don't. 

Maybe I'm just unlikeable. So, I didn't mind much about it. But today, after accidentally stumbling upon a clip from the Loud House (one of my favourite shows growing up, it is still running by the way), something clicked in me. I am lonely. I feel lonely. I feel like I am sitting in a crowd but I'm alone. Maybe I deserve this feeling. Being a lonely man in a lively world. I loved that show not because it was funny or because the characters were nice or anything, it was just because the characters had each other. When I see them hugging each other, I felt like I want that, being wanted by my family, or anyone really. When I see the main character and his best friend, I envy that, I want to have a best friend that I can count on too, and he can count on me. I really wanted that.

But I suppose we can't have everything we want in life. So, I suppose that is my story. Thanks for reading, and I hope you have a wonderful day or night wherever you may be.

1jihr50,"Is ""connection"" supposed to feel like something?","Do you have a connection to some other person(s) in your life, or perhaps a connection to your pet(s)? Does it feel like something? Do you have an emotion associated with your connection? Is it a good emotion? Is it at least partially a good emotion? When life sucks for you, do you get some kind of comfort from your connections?

I don't know if these are weird questions or not. I think I've just recently realized that a big part of the reason people choose to go on living even when their lives are shit, is because they have a connection to someone, or maybe a bunch of connections to a bunch of someones, that make life feel like it's worth living.

What's your experience like? Do you never feel done with life because you always can look forward to experiencing connections with someone? Or do you feel done with life and stay here only because you don't want to cause your people to suffer? Is there something in your connection(s) that makes you feel like your life is worth living, that gives you something to look forward to?

I feel like the proverbial person who has lived their life in a monochrome gray room -- there's no way for them to know what it's like to see a color, even if they studied color theory to the Nth degree. Of course, I could be wrong, I don't know for sure that a connection feels like something, but it sure would explain a lot and clear up a lot of my confusion about how other people get through life and actually want to keep going. It would explain why all these therapists over the decades keep telling me that I'll feel better if I make more friends -- there's supposed to be something in friendship that feels good and is comforting and kindof makes up, at least a little, for how shit life is? Why else would therapists keep recommending it?

1jif341,Should I (21m) join incel communities?,"

I (21m) have a rough post history that should indicate excruciating life struggles pertaining to isolation and a lack of dating options. I've done everything in my power, for years upon years, to try and ""put myself out there"", but it's always felt like I'm in square one no matter how far or how hard I try to dig myself out of this proverbial hole.

All said and done, I want to join an incel community. I feel like it's the only place where I wouldn't stick out like a sore thumb, where I can find solace in the company of those doomed to fail at life as I eventually will (or have already). At this point I've accepted that I'll never have romantic or sexual relationships again; I'm just so ugly and everything I do is a turn off to most ""normal"" people, for lack of a better word.

I've recently come to a realization that I'm probably autistic/neurodivergent, though I'm comfortable enough to call myself r*tarded since nothing could be closer to the truth. It's been a very hard pill to stomach as I'm probably the LAST person who should be cursed with any kind of social disability.  I crave human intimacy, I'd give an arm and a leg to form effortless connections with others, especially with the opposite gender; but I'm endowed with something that makes it infinitely harder to obtain, at which point giving up is the most reasonable course of action.

I want everyone's unbiased opinions on the incel communities because I'm wary and wilfully avoidant of the consequential negativity that pervades them. In short, I need to know if any of them are non-toxic, non misogynistic etc., spaces where I can just exist among other unfortunate souls? I'll never have the place of belonging I truly need, but if this is the next best thing, so be it.

I know practically nothing when it comes to being social. I've existed around others for years yet I've learned precious little about social cues, appropriate decorum, or all that jazz surrounding interpersonal protocol. I'm starved of physical affection, devoid of emotional connections and severely detached from any positivity otherwise afforded the rest of society.

Just tell me where I should go, and if the incel communities are the haven I believe it to be. I'll never be loved to the extent I've aways desired, so I might as well hate myself surrounded by those that would do the same.

DISCLAIMER: I'll try to ignore replies that I disagree with because it almost always cascades into an argument when I respond in states of visceral emotional intensity (such as now, to state the obvious).

P.S. try not to ridicule the depths to which I strain in adequately expressing my thoughts and feelings through writing... I have the self awareness to realize that even the stilted manner in which I write serves as a testament to how r*tarded I am. Though there's nothing I know that would solve such debilitating hard-wiring.

Over the last 2 years, I have made some serious changes to my health. There is a post on my profile about it, but basically I went from drinking 40ish beers a week to occasionally 2 a week, if that. I have lost 60 lbs, I go to the gym to keep myself in the best shape I’ve ever been in, and I work construction. 

I did all of these changes for me, for my health, but I’d be lying if I said I didn’t want a relationship out of it. I constantly seem to end up in the friend zone. I’m not particularly good at talking to girls, though I think I’m better now than I used to be. 

This all came to a head over the last couple weeks. I met a girl at my climbing gym and hit it off with her. We started climbing together a bunch, hung out for a bite to eat a few times, and I thought the vibes were great. She even told me that she was really looking forward to spending time with me. 

Last weekend, we went out for a chill night out together and again I thought we were hitting things off really well. I dropped her off at her place, said goodnight and made tentative plans to hang out during this past week. When I got home though, I got that dreaded text that I’ve gotten 1000 times before: “I just got out of a really toxic relationship, and as much as I like spending time with you, I’m not ready for that again yet”. 

I immediately felt all of that old self doubt slamming into me like a ton of bricks. I sent her a message saying I understood, and I hoped we could still spend time together as friends, seeing if maybe this could turn into something. She heart reacted that, and responded absolutely. I figured at least that’s a start. However, she has not responded to hardly any messages this week. The plan had been for me to help her move some furniture and other things this week, but each time I asked for a time to help her out, she came up with some reason why she couldn’t(they could be true, probably are, just feels like she’s avoiding me).

1jgz9ro,3 am mental breakdown,"It’s been a month since I’ve been in a very negative emotional state. I’m 15 and school feels so lonely. I always sit alone, and I’m constantly alone. The thing is I don’t think anyone in my family could even guess that this is how I spend all of my school days. I feel like I can’t be myself anywhere, that I don’t belong anywhere either. I always act happy when I’m around my family because I can’t bring myself to be vulnerable around them. But nobody gives a fuck about me or cares about how I’m doing. I lost a few friends since last year and grew apart some of them too. But it’s not the only reason of why I feel lonely. I feel lonely in my head, I feel lonely when I’m surrounded by people, I feel lonely when I’m having a good time. I can’t talk about how I feel to anyone I know because I know that they wouldn’t care or listen, or would just minimize my feelings or make fun of me. I don’t feel like I have anyone in my entourage who I feel comfortable with and close to . I do have friends who I talk to from time to time, but I don’t feel a real bond or connection to any of them. I lost a few friends like I said earlier, but even them didn’t care about me either, or were straight up toxic people. So I’ve been feeling very sad, and the fact that I don’t have anybody to talk about it or cheer me up makes me even sadder. I didn’t have school this week, classes where canceled. I spent all my days staying at home, with almost no notifications on my phone, no one to talk to even irl, with no motivation to do anything but lay down. During times like these, I start to hate my body and myself, and I disgust myself. I eat more because of sadness and stress, then cry because I feel so fat, but still can’t stop myself from eating so much. People don’t believe me when I say I hate myself and say they’d do anything to look like me, but they wouldn’t be able to comprehend the pure hatred I have for this body. I also feel guilty for not doing anything all day, but still procrastinate and feel stressed while doing so. Every night, I can’t sleep at all and start to think about every thing that’s wrong in my life, then i fall asleep and have nightmares almost every time. I can’t stop comparing myself to everyone I know, and think about how dumb, ugly, fat and useless I feel. I feel so lost and behind in life compared to people my age or people I know. But I don’t have the motivation to do anything about it or even think positively, so I just pity myself. I think what makes me feel the worst is I can’t bring myself to accept the way I’m feeling. I stay on my phone all day to avoid my brain from having these negative thoughts, then nighttime comes and everything comes out at once. I can’t talk about it to my brother and my parents cause I’m just not used to it and it brings me a huge feeling of discomfort, but keeping everything to myself is so painful too. These feelings are so heavy that I couldn’t even bring myself to talk about them to my therapist, it just wouldn’t come out and I don’t know why, so I just lied during my session. I don’t know how to get out of this negative place I’m in mentally",riexxxxxxx,2,8,No Flair,mental breakdown month since ive negative emotional state im school feel lonely always sit alone im constantly alone thing dont think anyone family could even guess spend school day feel like cant anywhere dont belong anywhere either always act happy im around family cant bring vulnerable around nobody give fuck care im lost friend since last year grew apart reason feel lonely feel lonely head feel lonely im surrounded people feel lonely im good time cant talk feel anyone know know wouldnt care listen would minimize feeling make fun dont feel like anyone entourage feel comfortable close friend talk time time dont feel real bond connection lost friend like said earlier even didnt care either straight toxic people ive feeling sad fact dont anybody talk cheer make even sadder didnt school week class canceled spent day staying home almost notification phone one talk even irl motivation anything lay time like start hate body disgust eat sadness stress cry feel fat still cant stop eating much people dont believe say hate say theyd anything look like wouldnt able comprehend pure hatred body also feel guilty anything day still procrastinate feel stressed every night cant sleep start think every thing thats wrong life fall asleep nightmare almost every time cant stop comparing everyone know think dumb ugly fat useless feel feel lost behind life compared people age people know dont motivation anything even think positively pity think make feel worst cant bring accept way im feeling stay phone day avoid brain negative thought nighttime come everything come cant talk brother parent cause im used brings huge feeling discomfort keeping everything painful feeling heavy couldnt even bring talk therapist wouldnt come dont know lied session dont know get negative place im mentally,-0.14401785714285714,0.5768749999999998
1jgql9c,Does anyone feel like this specific feeling of loenliness? What feeling is this and why does it happen?,"Im going to start by saying I looked at multiple subreddits and this one seems like the better one for me to post this in. It could also work into different subreddits, but this one seems the most fitting. Ive only shared this briefly with my parents and a bit more in depth with my therapist, so its a bit weird to figure out how to put it into words.

So im just going to say it: I feel like im missing someone thats supposed to be here, but isnt. Its not a certain person that has a name or face, its not someone I\`ve met. The best way to explain it is, and i\`m sorry if this sounds a bit nerdy or something, like someone was actually here, but they got erased somehow and everyone\`s memories of them were erased as well.  However, I can still feel them, but not strongly enough to see their face or actually remember who they were. (What i feel is important to point out is that i **know** that didnt happen, nobody got magically wiped out, its just a sensation that I\`m trying to understand\*\*)\*\*.

As if(and this is the part that sounds nerdy), they live in a parallel universe. I like to think of parallel universes not as actual parallel strings, but as a big lump of strings, all mixed in together, still separate though. And sometimes there are places in which the strings are closer to one another and you can hear/feel something from the other universe. Similar to that, it almost feels like the veil between two realities is thinner in some places and what i feel is an echo of what is happening in the parallel universe. (bear with me) Again,  I don't actually belive that's what's happening, it's just a comparison, because I'm trying to put into words.

Throught the ages of 9/10 - 14, I've sometimes had pretty real dreams in which I was with someone and I could feel this comforting, warm, calms-your-nervous-system kind of peace. Those people felt real and there was a sense of safety when I was with them. I would wake up and miss them.

Then, when I was 14, a pretty weird thing happened. It's the first time I've felt this sensation and it's also the strongest way I've experienced it. I was at school, we had to go outside. Slowly but surely, I started feeling like someone is missing. I was sitting with all of my friends, but still I felt this strong feeling (im so sorry for how much im gonna say this word) like there was an actual person, name, face, personality, that wasn't here. I looked at all my classmates, it was so real I felt the need to count everyone. Sure enough, everyone was there. It was pretty weird, like you miss someone, but you don't know who.

Later that day, or the following day, at dinner, with my parents and brother, I had the same feeling: someone is also supposed to literally sit down with us at the table and they aren't here, like they were taken from us. It's a bittersweet, mostly sad but also a bit agitating eerie sense of longing.

Like a month ago (I'm now 17), I was on Pinterest and i saw this pretty, aesthetic clip of two girls running on a field. For the first time in a long time, i started feeling the whole missing thing again(more soothing though) and i remember thinking: ""I miss her"", except idk who it is and the memories that never happened are very foggy.

A few weeks ago, I was going to school. On the radio, there was a song that had a piano segment very similar to Je te laisserai des mots. Like 10 minutes after, the golden morning rays of sunshine shined in such a pretty way and the birds were chirping. It looked like a cinematic shot of a comforting movie or like a scene from a Life is Strange montage (iykyk).  When I was inside of the school, someone was playing this beautiful song on a piano (our school has a piano that we can play when/if we want during break time). Then for a couple moments, as i was listening to the second piano song that morning, there was that feeling again, this time less of an ""where is this person, i need to find them in here"", and more of a warm, nostalgic sensation. I could almost see a face, I remembered this girl that was in my dreams years ago and she was my adoptive sister. It felt like **she is supposed to be here(** going to school, talking to me, laughing and just doing basic everyday things together) and i just missed her so much. Like everything was slightly off and **emptier**, without her. As if we are locked in separate rooms and I can hear her through the wall, except I don't know where the door is and I don't know to get to her. All in all, the feeling was a bit sad, but mostly comforting(!).

I've been a bit lonely these past few months, or even years(very grateful for my parents, especially my dad, because they're here for me and i don't know how much lonelier i would've been without them). So I thought it's just my minds way of coping, that's why I'm posting it in the loneliness subreddit.

I'm open to more interpretations spiritual of this.

My therapist suggested I talk to my mom  and see if I have/had a twin or something.

Thank you so much for reading all of this and hopefully not thinking I'm crazy :)

I deal with extreme boredom, can't describe in words
I have immense trouble learning anything
I have no job
I don't crave money that much (not rich either)
I have just 3 friends, I love spending time with them, enjoy a lot but they all are busy in their own lives, yet if i initiate they try to make time and meet, I feel genuine connection with them. Feel so ecstatic. But it's hard for them to meet everyday.
I feel so lonely tbh. I crave human connection so so much. There's nothing else that makes me happy.

Just an hour back i met one of my 3 friends after almost 2 months,, I'm still so overhwlmed by just 30 mins of conversation. Here's what happens whenever I meet him, I have so much to say that o end up talking so much, after the interaction is over I regret ruining it by talking so much, I feel the conversation could've been made better by talking better (i talked in very haphazard order, very scatterer thoughts, failed to convey the nuances and subtleties of my life situations (we usually talk about our lives), now i feel i didn't convey my thoughts better and he misunderstood me, didn't catch my points, to some degree it's true aswell

I have nothing in my life, it's easy to say develop a hobby, find purpose, but nothing of that sort motivate me, i can't act without certain type of stimulation or motivation behind it, people don't get it. The sole thing i enjoy is the company of people like my friends. In 29 years, I've found just 3 such people.  I don't know what's ahead for me in my life. I just wannna feel better. Have a happy decent normal life. 
I'm married too, but feel no connection with her of that intellectual sort, also she has her own hysterical tantrums, that's also the reason I don't see her as a close friend.

I crave human connection sooo much
But feel that i have ruined the interactions (i do ruin) when I meet the people i love (my friends)
Maybe it's because i don't see them daily
I see them after long time, so i have to tell them everything and i can't line up all if that hence talk in scattered manner, idk.
They don't have time for me. Busy in their lives

1jgkil6,How Social Media is Contributing to the Loneliness Epidemic - And What We Can Do About It?,"Loneliness is no longer just a personal struggle, it’s a global issue that social media professionals need to take seriously. According to a recent Gallup study, **23% of people worldwide** say they feel lonely often. What’s more concerning? Loneliness doesn’t just exist—it **amplifies** other negative emotions:

* People who feel lonely are **36% more likely to feel sad**
* **31% more likely to feel worried**
* **30% more likely to feel stressed**
* Even anger and physical pain increase when loneliness is present

This raises an important question for our industry: **Is the way we build and engage communities online helping or hurting this problem?**

# The Role of Social Media in Loneliness

Social platforms were meant to connect us, but for many, they have done the opposite. The rise of engagement-driven algorithms has led to an emphasis on performance - likes, shares, status - rather than **authentic connection**. Users, especially younger demographics, often feel pressured to curate their lives rather than build meaningful relationships.

Financial hardship is another major factor, those struggling to make ends meet are **twice as likely** to feel lonely. This suggests that access to social engagement and mental well-being tools may be disproportionately available to those with economic stability.

1jg9rd1,Lonely Dreams,"hey all. I just woke up and had this bad dream, but don't know/have anyone to tell, so I though I'd put it here.

So basically, my dream started in a movie theater, and I was watching an X-Men movie (Ive been watching those recently) when all of a sudden, I felt a girl sit beside me, lean her head against mine as she brought her hand to my hair and softly brushed it. She kept on whispering how glad she was to be here with me, watching this, and I remember tearing up. I looked at her and she looked at me and told me to ""Let it go"". I closed my eyes and cried against her, as she stroked my hair and kept whispering to me about how she's here now. Sometime later, when I opened my eyes, she was gone and the movie was over. I was suddenly outside and on my phone (dream transitions kinda suck) and saw that she messaged me, saying how much of a good time she had with me, and asked if i could visit her that night, where we could watch some demon slayer movie (which is weird cuz i dont watch any anime) and if we could play some GTA after (something I do play a lot). I remember being happy about how she wanted to play video games and watch another movie with me. As i was typing my response however, i woke up at around 6am, which is my usual time. I woke up confused and defeated, mad that it wasn't real, before getting ready for my day.

I know these things are really personal to me, but they’re also a big part of who I am right now, and it’s disheartening when people don’t take the time to even pretend to care.

I have online friends and some IRL friends. IRL friends consists of a board game community of friends and Church goers. Online friends consists of extended family and also ex-uni friends who has already moved on with life (family, work, etc) which exists in a form of WhatsApp group chat.

I never felt I had a true close friend. There are people calling me his/her friend but I don't know why I never really really felt I had any friends. Just people I know. To me, people don't really know me and I don't really find it comfortable to talk to people about myself specifically. I usually ask about them, get info about them, listen to what they have to say about their opinions on politics, stuffs, life, family, etc. But I never truly feel people know me or wants to know me.

My parents were the type to raise us siblings freely and didn't really have a family tradition of going to vacations or all those family stuffs. We were poor. I grew up poor and now I am on my own, I feel detached from my parents. I ask about them, how they are doing, what's new, how is life, anything they want to talk about, but never had the opening to tell them about myself and what I am going through. They simply don't ask and we don't have deep conversations on things.

Recently I've been meeting an escort and she has been a good listener. But even then... There is just this emptiness. This void, I'm not alone, but I feel lonely. without friends. Yeah...

I hope that if I have a son/daughter in the future... Having my own family, I would want to talk to them. Listen to them and know them. I would also share my heart out to them. Let them know who I am and what I feel like... Maybe then I would have true friends.

1jd4pw5,Could virtual frosted glass help you feel less lonely?,"Hey everyone,

I am a freelance software developer. I live and work alone and I often feel unbearably lonely. I often get this feeling of ""cabin fever"" that is sometimes so strong that it feels like panic.

I want to talk to you about an idea that might make you feel less lonely, like it made me.

I’ve built an app that uses virtual frosted glass to make video meetings more comfortable and less intrusive. The idea is to let people be present on camera ""frosted"" - without fully revealing visual details, which can help relieve the pressure of being ""on display"".

I use it with a friend of mine. We both have it running automatically when Windows starts. When we both have our laptops on, we can see each other behind the virtual frosted glass. We can turn on our microphones to talk if we want. The video is reciprocal - we can only see each other when our cameras are on. We can unfrost each other with confirmation from both sides. The CPU and bandwidth usage is so low that the video can be left on.

By communicating this way, I started seeing and talking to my friend much more often. I immediately started feeling less lonely because I knew that I might see my frosted friend when I turn my laptop on.

I wonder if this concept of virtual frosted glass could be useful for you against loneliness as it was for me.

* Will virtual frosted glass make it less stressful for you to be on video?
* Can virtual frosted glass encourage you to stay on video longer?
* Will the privacy of virtual frosted glass encourage you to meet other people via video?

I’d really appreciate your thoughts!

1jd4byq,"Same Stuff, Different Day (Tl;Dr down below)","I've made a post on here regarding me being upset over Valentine's Day and linked a video of me coming back from work and crashing out because of it. So this is pretty much a calm, more tame type of post, while mentioning stuff I previously haven't mentioned.

I have been lonely for a pretty long while. I can't remember how long it's been but I do remember memories and dreams alike of me crashing out regarding whatever situation I was in. But I genuinely believe it's getting worse as I grow older. It could be from nights of me breaking down regarding me being desperate for a partner or someone to be there for me in my lowest states, or just human nature.

I've been diagnosed with depression and anxiety in my teens, obviously came from hormones as I was an attention-seeking Neanderthal around that age. But now turning 20 soon, it hasn't gotten any better. I'm still shy around everyone, I would prefer to isolate myself unless if I'm with the right people.

I've mentioned that I work retail, I've been working since a few months after I graduated. I genuinely thought it would help my confidence, considering I would be forced to interact in public. And while it did work in some scenarios, it does take a toll on my mental health, as I've tried ending my life multiple times. I personally don't have a problem with my job, I have great coworkers that look out for me, customers who genuinely enjoy my presence, and that the job is easy as hell, aside the burnout in between shifts.

The biggest thing that bothers me is that considering I have coworkers I talk to on a daily. Some of them talk about their life and how great it is. Whether that'll be going out on vacation with their family, spending time with loved ones. Or hanging out outside of work. And it's like while I do hang out with my stoner friends once every week. It's like damn, There's people here genuinely doing something with their lives and all I do is work and sit at my house alone. 

It gets worse when I see couples my age holding hands while walking, hugging, or whatever PDA Stuff they're doing. And to be frank, I'm not against any of that whatsoever, I'm happy of course. It's just that I never got to experience that growing up. I've had 4 girlfriends my entire life, and I have not done anything, mainly because I was scared to, thinking I was being too pushy, or too weird. I can't even say I love you to someone I'm with.

For years I have isolated myself. I've always said I wanted to run away but I know if I was anywhere by myself i would be self neglectful. If left alone without responsabilities, with all the money in the world and no one to be responsible for other than myself, I wouldn't bother making myself food, getting out of bed or trying to do anything with my money. I have never been able to visualise my future, I've felt like I was meant to die young but it hasn't happened yet or something. I'm not actively suicidal or anything.

For the last few years even at my happiest I've always felt it in the back of my mind. I don't feel worthy of life. Nothing extremely traumatic has happened to me, I have no reason for this.

I can't even say I gave up on myself cos I don't think I was ever there. If someone tried to kill me, adrenaline aside, I don't think id run, truly I feel like I deserve it. I know I'm wasting my life why don't I care to fix it. I'm constantly asking for a sign that I'm worthy or that there is a plan for me but I know that at the end it's not real and the only person that can fix this is me.

1jarqle,I'm building an app to help address the loneliness epidemic. Would love your honest feedback!,"Hey everyone,

I’m a computer science and design master’s student who wants to make the world a little better. For the past few months, I’ve been working on an app idea, and I’d love to hear your thoughts.

I personally struggle with making friends and have mild social anxiety. It can be really rough some days. I’ve tried a bunch of social and friend-making apps, but I’ve never felt good about any of them.

**The idea is simple:**

Instead of focusing on dating-like profiles, awkward meetups, or curated dinners, this app gives you small social challenges to help you step outside your comfort zone in the real-world.

It meets you at your current social comfort levels and integrates challenges into your daily routine. For example:

* If you regularly go to cafes, take public transport, or go the gym but never actually talk to anyone, it might challenge you to give a genuine compliment, start a small conversation about a suggested topic, or even just say hi.
* The goal is to help you practice social skills in low-pressure situations for those who find it intimidating or challenging to talk to new people.
* It can also track your progress over time and see how different challenges and situations impact your nerves or feelings of loneliness.

My philosophy is this: If I can go about my everyday life being open, curious, and willing to interact with those around me, I can naturally find acquaintances, friends, best friends, opportunities, or partners. I know this because that's how I've generally met every person I've ever met before. Even if you never see them again, spontaneous interactions make daily life much more fun and interesting anyway.

I genuinely want to help, so I’d love to hear your honest thoughts and opinions. Would you find something like this actually useful? What sucks? What’s confusing? What’s missing?

1j9tfkk,Why do I feel the need to be lonely & cry about it?,"I don't know how to put this, but I've been wondering if I'm the only one experiencing this and why this happens. 

To put simply, I sometimes feel like I want/need to be lonely. I recognize this itself is wrong, since I also want and need the company of others. I yearn to belong and be wanted, but once the feeling of loneliness hits, I start to provoke it more. E.g. I start daydreaming of scenarios that make me cry etc etc. I also find myself imagining my future without a family and friends, sort of wishing I had none so I could really say I'm lonely, if that makes sense. Of course I don't want my family or friends to be gone, dear god no, but I get that feeling from time to time. And while I start feeling like this I also want to cry? It's not a rare occasion for me to cry in bed before I fall asleep. Why is this?

Of course, the reason why I feel lonely is because I lack a proper community IRL. I do live with my family and we spend every night at least an hour of just playing UNO & eating together, but they don't fulfill this need. They're not the people I'd go first talking about my problems. This doesn't explain the previously mentioned questions, however, or then I don't realize how this lack of a community explains them.

1j8u165,The Hidden Impact of Social Media on Mental Health – A New Approach,"Social media has completely changed how we connect, but let’s be real, it’s not always for the better. While it helps us stay in touch, it also fuels social comparison, self-doubt, and unrealistic expectations. Seeing perfectly curated lives online can make anyone feel like they’re falling short. Studies even link excessive social media use to body dissatisfaction, anxiety, and depression.

The problem? Self-discrepancy, the gap between who we are and who we *think* we should be. Social media highlights this gap by constantly showing us idealized versions of life, making it harder to appreciate our own reality.

But it doesn’t have to be this way. Here are a few ways to protect your mental health while staying online:  
**- Practice media literacy** – Recognize when content is filtered or unrealistic.  
**- Limit screen time** – Taking breaks can boost self-esteem and reduce anxiety.  
**- Curate your feed** – Follow accounts that uplift you and mute the ones that don’t.  
**- Engage in real-life connections** – Social media shouldn’t replace meaningful offline relationships.

If you’re struggling, you’re not alone. There are plenty of resources out there to help. Prioritizing mental well-being should always come first.

That’s why platforms like Socialode are trying something different, focusing on *real* connections, not followers or fake portrayals. No likes, no pressure, just genuine friendships based on shared interests.

1j8dbwq,My whole life flipped upside down in a week and idk what to do,"About two weeks ago, I (22F) was in a car accident with my abuser. (22M)

Backstory: 
We met in rehab when we were teenagers because we both were in for suicidal ideation. We ended up seeing each other again and rehab, and I thought it meant something because you were randomly assigned a place to go and have no control over it we kept in touch After we got released but we lived about an hour away from each other so eventually he got a girlfriend and I was blocked on everything for some reason. 

I moved on with my life. I got sober. I suffered a lot of hardships like losing my dad. But eventually, I moved away for college and then moved to the city of my choice to start my life. Shit hit the fan after the second move. I was super alone so I would just drown myself in work. The one family member I had down there got in a relationship and was away, so I felt like I had no one and was spiraling. I had a friend who was supposed to move in with me down there, but she too got in a relationship and decided she wasn’t gonna come. I inevitably moved back home to my hometown after trying to start over and felt very defeated and insecure I started to try to hang out with some of my old friends and then one day I got a follow request from this guy from rehab after nearly 4 or five years

so I messaged him. We ended up hanging out. It was really nice. I’m the one who is pushing for it. A month into hanging out we went on our first trip. He didn’t have money so I fully paid for it myself and lied about how much it cost and told him that it was a family friends condo because I didn’t wanna make him feel insecure. It was on this trip that I started calling him My boyfrienda month and a half later I was tired of commuting an hour back-and-forth to his house so I convinced him to move to my hometown and we would split bills. Shit got really dark really fast and he kept trying to take his life in front of me with either a gun or a knife except he wasn’t actually trying to. He would secretly empty the bullets out first.  he simply just wanted to scare me and get attention. I didn’t understand because we both had come so far given our past and I was everything he could’ve needed and did everything he wanted so how could he be so upset that he wanted to end his life? 

He never paid his half of the rent or bills. I didn’t trust him so I didn’t actually put him on the lease. In this situation ended in him being taken away to another mental hospital and me having to call the police multiple times. We break up after only four months. And I go no contact completely for the next 11 months. In that time he called me over 10,500 from NoCallerID. 

This was my first boyfriend and I was really happy with him. I enjoyed his presence and our sexual relationship. It just started to get controlling and I didn’t pick up on the red flags. My friends were there for me I recovered, but around Halloween of 2024 it didn’t sit right with me how things ended. I never got to say my piece. 

My friend prank called him when we were all sitting around the fire drinking, and a girl answered the phone. I didn’t like this so later that night I called him and said I had something really important to tell him and that he needed to leave that girl. I later found out that he was homeless and jobless and using this girl who was his cousin‘s baby mother for a place to stay. I didn’t intend on getting back with him. I just didn’t want him to be with anybody after what he did to me and his ex he didn’t deserve to have anyone if I had to suffer and be so lonely when I only had good intentions. 

I start to get mixed feelings of nostalgia and anger and I want the money that I was owed so we keep in contact because I’m really just trying to get my get back. I just don’t know how I’m gonna do it yet. I end up catching feelings because I’m not a evil spiteful or revengeful person. We meet up in person to talk at a hotel parking lot. he buys me food. He gives me some cash. He even lets me strip search him to make sure he has no weapon weapons.  (Red flags I know) we were just gonna talk, but we end up having a sexual interaction. 

I realize that sex is a scapegoat for me as I’m now sober, and I knew he would give it to me if I asked. This escalated into us sneaking around. I would degrade him and argue with him and tell him how much he hurt me and then he would try to make me feel better physically. I had a lot going on being full-time in school working two jobs and living an hour away from him so I told him there was not much we could do other than try to keep in touch virtually and that we would see each other when we see each other. He didn’t like this and would get angry if I didn’t respond to his messages quick enough, so he found out where I worked and started calling my job. I had to cut it off. I had to block him because he was already showing red flags and mental health issues in coming in between me my work my friendships my responsibilities in my goals. 

Flash forward to late December. the friends I have in my life Had boyfriends and would spend a majority of their time with them. I was simply trying to distract myself with school and work and it wasn’t working. I was so lonely. I end up calling him on January 5. He answers at 2 o’clock in the morning and is telling me he doesn’t wanna talk that he’s doing good that he doesn’t need me anymore but I know that that’s a lie. We end up talking for two hours. I get clarity. He’s being very expressive and apologetic and enforcing his own boundaries which I like. Makes me think that he changed. As my friends are no longer really around and I’m going through some friendship heartbreak. I am very weak and lonely and realize I want the physical affection and comfort from my ex. 

I’m very busy and this time in my life as well but I still want someone. I start seeing him when I can and we mainly just chill. Watch Netflix go thrift go eat and have sex. He’s being really sweet and it’s really nice. I’m supposed to study abroad in March so in preparation for that I have to go to Atlanta every weekend for six weeks for class leading up to the trip. That’s about a 4 Hour Dr. At this time. I’m working 9:30 AM to six at night and then taking six classes in school so my time is fully called for. I find out that I have to go to Atlanta two weeks earlier than expected. This sent me into a spiral because  I was unprepared. I had my first work event on the 13th so I worked 8:30 AM to 830 at night then had to drive to Atlanta afterwards for class then had to drive back so I decided I would stay with him since it was Valentine’s Day.  then I had to work the next day from 9 AM to six or later. We start to celebrate Valentine’s Day after this busy 3 days passed . I show up at his house late Saturday night showing him the stuff I got from work, and he’s so unamused and starts making comments about the shirts not looking like something I would pick out. He says he doesn’t want a whore who wears crop tops. I’m upset because I just worked my ass off for 72 hours straight and was excited to show him my new things. he said I must not want to be with him because I didn’t immediately drop everything and touch him or kiss him this turns me off. I fall asleep in my work clothes laying on top of my arm. I wake up two hours later turn over because my arm is asleep and I guess I woke him up so he gets up out of bed, pulls the blankets off, Turns all the lights on and starts rummaging around in the kitchen for something. He says I’m using him for a place to stay and that he’s fucking done and that he doesn’t think I truly want to be with him because I keep moving and not touching him. I apologize and say I’m just really tired and that I promise everything‘s OK. He says it’s not OK so I say I’ll sleep on the floor so I don’t keep waking him up. He says no why don’t I get the fuck out and takes my stuff and throws it outside at 2 o’clock in the morning. I’m very scared so I end up going And putting all my stuff in my car because I also have my dog with me. I’m so tired from all my hard work that I fall asleep in my car without even knowing it I wake up and it’s about 6 AM.  I’m really confused so I go bang on his door to let me back in Because I also need to use the bathroom. He says that I can’t use him for a place to use the bathroom or a place to sleep, but he lets me in anyways the next day we get up and he starts an argument about me not having him on social media Every time I add him on social media he picks a fight about random strangers in my follow list so one of my boundaries was him not monitoring my social media. He goes and grabs all my shit again and throws it outside. My computer included, which is what I used to do my schoolwork on and work on. I called the cops, but he cleans everything up before they get there. the cops didn’t believe me I left and went home crying my eyes out not understanding how he could do this to me. 

We didn’t talk for a week and then the next weekend I spend the weekend with my family. On this weekend, I got the flu started my period two weeks early and also had to quit vaping Cold Turkey. I was not doing well. I was out of work for half the week and then it came down for me to make another trip to Atlanta for class. I asked everyone I knew to help me get there to drive me everyone in my support group, and they all said no. I was getting on the road late at night closer to 730 and the person I usually stay with called me and said that it was too late and then I would be better off driving up in the morning but it’s four hours so I would have to wake up at 3 AM and leave by four. Not knowing what to do with my stress I get super overwhelmed and I call my abuser and beg him to please take the day off and drive me to Atlanta I’m in desperate need of some help. I’m so stressed. I’m having panic attacks and I feel like I can’t take care of myself or get myself there safely. He agrees and we have a good night and a good morning I get to class I do class and we were good to go from there. We walk around campus we go to lunch and he starts making comments to me about the guys on campus asking me which ones did I fuck. I’m an online student most of the time and never met anyone in my time living in Atlanta or the other city of my choice Like literally nobody I almost thought something was wrong with me because no one ever hits on me or tries to be my friend this is why I latch onto him, but he truly doesn’t believe me. We’re on the way back in the car. He’s getting road rage. He’s arguing with me about the emojis that are in my recently used emojis he’s arguing with me about me googling why little baby got arrested. He’s saying that I must not be into him if I’m googling other men who wear black ( he’s white) he’s blasting music on full volume in my car when I’m trying to do schoolwork. I ask him to please turn it down and I tell him I don’t like the song he’s playing because they’re very manipulative and shit light on the kind of relationship we have. He’s increasingly more frustrated. He’s arguing with me. He’s telling me his head is fucked up and that it’s really bad this time and that I make him worse. So we write in silence. We had left at 4 AM that morning so we were both very tired. I do school work in the car until we’re about 15 minutes away from home in that car ride. He had asked me if I had met God yet and started playing Christian music, but he doesn’t go to church or talk about God or listen to Christian music so I found it really scary the whole time I was thinking damn I really wanted to love him and be loved in return but I’ve gotta leave him alone. He’s dangerous. We’re driving on a back road and about 10 minutes away from home. I close my eyes briefly to rest thinking that I’m gonna have to drive an hour home after I drop him off, not even two seconds after I close my eyes I hear a loud noise and open my eyes to us flying through the air at 65 miles an hour. We crashed into a ditch and I can’t see anything and I’m in shock and in pain. My glasses were missing so he helps me find them but other than that he didn’t do anything. He didn’t scream he didn’t cuss. He didn’t check on me. I had to tell him to call 911 when police got there he claimed it was a deer. We go to the hospital and he just starts yelling at me about everything when I can’t even walk and I’m moaning and groaning in pain. My car is totaled. My glasses are damaged. My computer is damaged and I can’t afford to miss work or school when I’m supposed to be going to Dubai in two weeks for a study abroad. All hell breaks loose once I get home from this incident I blocked him on everything, but none of my friends were here for me because they found out I was with him. The same friends I asked for a ride, but it wouldn’t take off work to help me. I was desperate and I did have a good first half of the day with him. I don’t understand why things went so wrong. I don’t understand why he would do such a thing and drive off the road. My life already felt hard and now it was 10 times harder. No one has been here for me since not my mom not my friends. In fact, they blocked me on everything. They happen to work at the doctors office I go to and they actually have threatened to drop me as a patient and refuse to answer my phone calls when I called to book appointments. I live in a small town in this doctors office was the best care I could get. My back and leg are still fucked. I’ve had multiple x-rays and multiple MRIs and I’m just waiting to hear back on what’s wrong. I wasn’t able to walk for three days. He has called my phone over 800 times from no caller ID. He even called my job. I could now lose my job over this. I almost wasn’t able to still go on the trip to Dubai because my professor found out about the wreck. Everything is 10 times harder I’m all alone. No one calls no one checks on me. I don’t know what to do with my stress. I’m very depressed. Every time I go to sleep I have nightmares every time I wake up it’s even more of a nightmare I’ve missed a lot of work because of this situation and now he’s coming between me and my job. I hate him but part of me still love him. It’s ridiculous but all I wanna do is have sex because that’s the only thing I know works to clear my head and I now don’t have access to any of that. I’m desperate to be loved. I’m desperate to be sought after.  But no one gives a single fuck. I’m just all alone trying to fathom how someone could do this to me trying to fathom how my friends gonna abandon me in a time like this trying to fathom how I’m supposed to move forward alone until further notice. Everything is uncomfortable, and my head has turned into a very uncomfortable place to be. I’m trying to stay organized. I’m going to all my doctors appointments and I’m going to therapy and I’m gonna go back to work. I’m behind on school, but I’m doing everything I can to catch back up and ask for extensions. I’ve been praying about it, but I don’t have any clarity yet. I really just want someone to love and love me back and be there at the end of the day And respect my goals in my boundaries. I’ve thought about calling him, but if I do, then the police will never believe me when something else happens. I just want company and I have none. What in the world am I supposed to do? Life is now excruciating I feel like I created the suffering for myself by being weak and drowning myself and work as a result, I’ve lost almost everything except for my life. I’m so lonely.

I've never been married, I'm an only child and my last living relative died from old age 15 years ago. I'm only retiring because I'm sick of the structural changes to the way of reporting expenses my employer implements every few years. Plus I'm starting to get some medical issues now I pass my 60th birthday last year. I celebrated my birthday on the company jet flying across the Indian Ocean. 

In my retirement I either need to buy a home in a unknown town or buy a motorhome I can drive around the world. In my 40 year career I've traveled to most countries and areas in our amazing world.

1j72v11,This loneliness is killing me from the inside and i don't know how longer i can take it,"I am 21M, and i have really been struggling with the romantic aspect of my life since i can remember. I have always thought of myself to be a very likeable person, i always know how to make people laugh, i'm constantly told i'm smart, i'm in great shape because i workout regularly and i always try to keep my higiene on pristine condition. However, since middle school i have always struggled with my love life, because ever since i started taking real interest in girls my age i am always rejected, the first years it was not a big deal, i used to think that this was just a one time occurrence and that'd be it, but ever since i think i have tried flirting with at least 10 girls and all of them had the same reaction, whenever i made my intentions clear they always either rejected me or started ghosting me.

I'm not gonna lie, there's a finite number of rejections i can take before i start doubting everything about myself, some of those girls said some really hurtful things about me that little by little started deteriorating my self-steem. Every time i take interest in a woman i always convince myself that this time is going to be different, but it always ends up the same; she loves spending time with me, looks for ways to be with me, starts the conversation, etc. But whenever i try to ask them out on a date or something similar, i always get the same rejection from all of them, i just don't understand how people can be so affectionate and close to me, but then almost feel repulsed by me when i try to take things further.
I am on my early 20's so friends my age are already dating, enjoying their love/sex life, getting into relationships, having girls try to fliirt with them, but i don't get to do any of that, i don't understand, am i not worthy of love? Am i that ugly? Is it because of something else?
Everyday that passes i just feel more awkward in my own body, i don't understand why i don't get to live a life like people my age, i'm 21 years old and i still don't know what it's like to have someone love me, to recieve a hug from someone who likes me, to kiss or even be intimate with a person. I feel extremely excluded and it feels like all my attempts at improving the situation are useless, every single time i talk to my close friends about a girl i'm starting to know they always try their best to help me, but the result even after their help is always the same.

1j6oj5f,I feel so tired. Is this how my life is going to be?,"Is it always going to be like this?


I'm 22. I recently lost my parent in a really traumatic way. I miss them so much. They were the only person who ever cared about me in my entire life. I feel their absence everyday. I see the things they left behind and cry every day. I remember how everything happened. I can't get those images out of my mind. I'm completely alone now.

I'm just so lonely. I'm extremely boring and because of that when people get to know me they just slowly stop hanging out with me. I live alone. I don't have parents. No one likes me. I can't change my personality.

It's been like that since always. I have 0 friends. I never had a single friend in my entire life, even in my childhood I never had a friend. 

After losing my parent. I recently moved to this new place. People used to sympathize with me at start and used to talk to me.

 I used to hang out with these people. I tried really hard to socialize with them. But after knowing that how boring i'm, they've Started to exclude me now. They hang out without me now. They used to call me outside but not anymore. I don't want to insert myself in a group where i'm not wanted or needed. I feel like they have more fun without me.

I hear the sounds of their laughter and talking while I'm inside feeling lonely, crying and missing my dead parent. They know i'm alone inside alone they just don't care.

The cherry on top is that i'm poor too. I don't have any money. I can't do anything even if i want to. I literally don't have money for it. I'm barely getting by.

Everyone has a family around me. I hear them talk. I feel so jealous. Everyone has someone they can talk to, someone who cares about them. 

I have no one, literally no one who cares about me. It's been days since i last talked to someone and the last time i talked to someone was when i was buying groceries, yeah it was the cashier. Lol. Oh and i live in a third world country, did i mention that.

I don't feel like eating. I don't want to do anything. I don't want to get up every morning to do nothing all day. 
I want someone to care about me. I want to care about someone. I want someone to talk to. I go outside but nothing ever happens. I'm so uninteresting that no one wants to know me and when they get to know me they just leave. I want to stop crying. It physically hurts now.

1j5vlgh,Is Social Media Making You Feel More Lonely?,"Social media is supposed to connect us, but sometimes it can feel like it does the opposite. Have you ever found yourself scrolling through your feed, seeing everyone else’s highlight reels, and feeling more alone than ever?

# Why Does This Happen?

Social media creates the illusion that everyone else is living their best life, while we’re stuck comparing ourselves in real time. It’s easy to forget that what we see online is often a curated version of reality.

Sometimes, even when we’re technically ""connected,"" the interactions can feel shallow. Comment sections, likes, and quick replies don’t always replace real conversations and meaningful connections.

# What Can Help?

If social media has been making you feel more isolated, here are a few things that might help:

* **Be mindful of how certain platforms make you feel.** If scrolling through a certain app leaves you feeling worse, consider limiting your time on it.
* **Prioritize real connections.** Reach out to a friend, even if it's just to check in. A simple conversation can make a big difference.
* **Curate your feed.** Follow accounts that inspire or uplift you instead of ones that make you feel like you’re missing out.
* **Engage more meaningfully.** Instead of just liking posts, try commenting or starting a conversation.

# You’re Not Alone

Loneliness is something many people experience, even when surrounded by online interactions. It’s okay to talk about it, and you’re not the only one who feels this way.

1j585yf,I built something that might help with loneliness,"I’ve struggled with loneliness for a long time, especially as someone from a first-generation immigrant family who moved around a lot in early adulthood. It always felt like I was starting over socially, and despite trying a lot of the usual suggestions, I often felt stuck.

Over the last four months, I’ve been working on something I wish I had back then — a platform called ActivityBuddy. It’s a place where you can book people to join you for activities like getting food, playing video games, or going for a walk (as long as it’s legal). The idea is to make it easier to find someone to share moments with, without the pressure of building an immediate friendship.

When you’re feeling lonely, the options can be limited:

* **Family or existing friends:** If you have close relationships, that’s amazing — but not everyone has that, and sometimes even the people closest to you can’t fully understand what you’re going through.
* **Making new friends:** This can take a lot of time and effort, especially as an adult. Friendships often form through work, hobbies, or events, but it can be hard to break through surface-level connections and build something deeper.
* **Online interactions:** Watching content or chatting online can ease loneliness temporarily, but it doesn’t always fill the need for real, in-person connection.
* **Therapy or counseling:** Talking to a professional can be incredibly helpful, but it’s not the same as having a casual, human-to-human conversation with someone who shares your interests.

I built ActivityBuddy as a small step toward filling that gap:

* You can pick an activity you enjoy and have someone join you, on your schedule.
* There’s no pressure to maintain a friendship — just share an experience when you want to.
* You choose the people you want to meet, which can make socializing feel safer and less intimidating.
* Spending time with others face-to-face can help improve social skills and build confidence.
* And who knows? Even without pressure, some connections might grow into real friendships.

We just launched in the Miami and Tampa metros, so if this sounds like something you’d be interested in (or if you have feedback), I’d love to hear it.

1j53l9b,"Spent My Life Running from Loneliness. Turns Out, I Was Chasing It Instead","Let me start by saying I’ve been battling loneliness for as long as I can remember. It’s like a shitty roommate who never pays rent and eats all my snacks.

Growing up, my parents were so authoritarian that sharing my thoughts with them felt riskier than discussing politics at Thanksgiving. So, I just… didn’t. At school, I was labeled a weirdo, though no one ever gave me the courtesy of an explanation. In high school, I decided to conform, which miraculously made the loneliness chill out for a bit. Turns out, blending in works, until you realize you’ve blended yourself into oblivion.

At 19, I moved to a foreign European country and figured, “Hey, new place, new me!” So I became the ‘yes’ guy. The clown. The one who would rather endure six hours in a deafening nightclub as an introvert than sit alone with my thoughts, which, let’s be honest, are mostly just anxiety-ridden existential rants. Loneliness felt like a full-body rash everywhere, inescapable, and only numbed by dissociating from reality.

Fast-forward to 30: most of the friends I made scattered across the globe, and I got tired of playing a role that wasn’t me. I decided to be myself, do what I actually enjoy, and, spoiler alert, loneliness came back with a vengeance. Turns out, the things that interest me are so niche that they make quantum physics look mainstream. So, I picked up smoking weed to deal with the solitude, which worked wonders… if my goal was to feel even more alone and miserable the next morning. After a few years of that genius coping strategy, I quit and refocused on personal growth.

Now, after many hours of introspection (read: arguing with myself like a crazy person), I’ve come to a few realizations about loneliness that I’d love to throw out there and see if anyone else relates:

	•	Lonely people tend to crave depth over quantity. We’re geeks. Emotional nerds.
	•	Many of us have been rejected or bullied for who we are, so we’ve learned to mask it.
	•	Since we hide our true selves, we hesitate to share what’s really on our minds—because let’s face it, getting a blank stare or awkward silence in response to your deepest thoughts kinda sucks.
	•	We often choose relationships based on “This is my only option right now, so either this person or loneliness.” Shockingly, picking a mismatched partner just to feel less alone somehow makes you feel even lonelier.
	•	We get so used to feeling lonely that when something pulls us out of it, we reject it. And then we complain about being lonely again. (10/10 self-sabotage.)
	•	I couldn’t care less about trends and superficial small talk. The idea of discussing last night’s reality TV drama makes me want to chew glass.

I don’t have all the answers. I still feel lonely a lot. But I’ve learned to talk myself through it, like the best friend I always wished I had. It helps, sometimes.

Do I still question the point of existence? Yeah. But I’ve also developed an equally strong counter-thought, thanks to metaphysics and spirituality:
“Being alone feels like hell, but maybe hell is exactly what I need right now, so I might as well make it as enjoyable as possible.”

I’m a 22-year-old guy who’s been feeling pretty down lately. I don’t really have any friends, and I’ve been stuck in my own head for way too long. I know something needs to change, and I think traveling might help me break out of this rut. I’m planning to take off for about 3 months on a tight budget, and while Japan is the place that’s calling to me the most right now, I’m open to other ideas too.

What I’m really hoping for is to find someone who’s in a similar place—someone who’s also looking to make a real connection, maybe even a best friend. It doesn’t matter if you’re male or female—I just want to meet someone who’s up for exploring, trying new things, and just being there for each other. No pressure, no strict plans, just good company and shared experiences.

I’m not here to judge anyone—I believe in accepting people for who they are. If you’re feeling lost, lonely, or just want to make a change in your life, maybe we can figure something out together. Let’s talk and see if we vibe.

1j08s9x,There is no one for me,"Hello I turned 20 this year. My family got divorced and for about 6 yrs I had lived with my mother meanwhile my elder brother (about 8 years older than me) lived still today with father, before my uni had started I was shifted with my father while my mother married another man and settled abroad. For a year or a half I cried and weeped for almost every day and I had became so depressed because I missed my mother and my father and brother were always toxic and unsupportive, they only try to be nice but at every critical moment they scolded and threatened to kick me out of the house almost every time every time I screw something or do something that I like they want to control everything even the haircut I keep can't be of my choice cus they don't like even a tiny bit long hair ,they always backbite and look for every little reason to intoxicate me and still for all the things they do they expect me to give them family time. But I learn from my mistakes and decided to avoid them at almost all costs .My mother called me almost every day till today and at start I used to tell her about every single thing because I didn't have any real friends, but slowly I avoided her too because of her husband who didn't like her talking about anyone but them. Also when I told her about how lonely I felt sometimes she would start to laugh and didn't get about how I felt which broke my heart certain times until I was mature enough to keep things to myself. My mother would sometimes become very emotional which causes both families disturbance as she begs her husband to bring her back to my country which caused fights even sometimes she calls my brother about my feelings (I never share anything private with my brother or Father) which makes my brother mad and he scolds as usual. One time my mom and I came up with an idea of having a pet since there was no one I could talk to or spend time with because I spend all of my Time in my room but father refused (because I wasn't a good son) and it would be costly for them (we are financially decent) even I cried in front of them they wouldn't take any step to help me heal even though they noticed that I have became a very quiet person (I was a very confident person before all this) 
Currently I have became null as I don't listen my emotional needs like talking to someone or spending time . There isn't single woman in the house after my mom oh God I miss feminity so much that soft and sweet voice for waking you up that lap so you could lay your head down those soft hands you could hold that person you can talk about anything all of that has gone Seeking feminity so bad I always think about how beautiful my life would be After marring the right girl, of course I crush on some girls don't have the confidence to talk to them so I would just look at them and avoid eye contact hoping they don't think me as a creep anyway after study I spend my spare time laying in my dark bedroom all depressed, suicidal, and tired filled with anger just wishing for my life be taken automatically one day so that I could rest forever.

1jywzqi,Progress! I feel better,"Hey everyone! I'm making this post for myself with you guys to talk about how I've been feeling better. 

I made a decision a couple of days ago that I would no longer hurt myself. That I would stop crying about it. I had just been sinking deeper and deeper into loneliness and misery for the past 6 years. I realized that I had so many unmet needs, and my body had been screaming and shouting for help.

Yesterday, I said enough is enough. I forced myself to go out. I had no idea where I was going. I just wanted to see the world. I drove to the beach. Sat by the ocean and watched the sunset. I took deep breaths and looked around me. I realized that I had been living in a fantasy. What the hell was I doing? I wasn't even part of society. I sat there and saw that people were living as normal. They were taking care of themselves. Going out with their family and kids. Enjoying the small things. Kids running around and old people relaxing. Everyone went there for the sole purpose of winding down and relaxing. I felt like I was part of society. I wasn't forsaken. Even though I was alone, I still felt included. Not isolated. Old me would've felt even lonelier. But I felt like I was just like them, taking care of me, and that made me feel included. I also started journalling and downloaded a picture of that wheel of emotions to be able to recognize and express my emotions better. I realized that I had very weak emotional awareness and that made me blind to my needs. 

I essentially said enough. Enough hurting myself. Enough depriving myself of its needs. Enough crying about it. Enough wasting my best years. Enough being cruel to myself. It's time to be gentle with it. Listen to it. Give it what it needs. Me and myself are a team not enemies. I won't hurt myself again. I realized that I was the only who was forcing myself to be isolated and lonely. No one made me lonely. I did.

1jyudv3,Lonely Marriage,"On paper, I'm not lonely - I'm busy. I'm married, I'm a mom, I have much to do.

Inside myself, I'm so incredibly lonely for something I gave up on a long time ago. I realized pretty early on that my marriage would be stable but loveless. It checks all the boxes for life needs and such, but it is unfulfilling in every emotional way. I have pretty much accepted this.

Really, he is emotionally abusive and always mean to me. Always. We are both always home, and there is never a kind interaction. Sometimes a neutral interaction if I'm lucky. 

I have a bit of a low libido anyway, but his behavior towards me does nothing to make me want to sleep with him. So of course that has furthered problems and his attitude toward me. Now, even if I try to initiate, he rejects me to maybe punish me or get back at me or something. Before cheating is assumed, he would have to leave the house to be doing that in real life.

I was always going to end up here. It seems I can't accept romantic love. In the past, when I was in relationships with men who showed me any kind of real affection and love, it was only a matter of time before I blew it up. 

Before everyone tells me to leave, it's not that simple. Before people tell me to get therapy, I'm in therapy and even medicated. I know logically all the things and that I don't deserve this and what am I showing my children, etc.

I'm not really writing this for problem solvers or advice givers.

1jytgep,23M Northamptonshire Lonely Human Seeks Other Humans for Friendship & Shenanigans,"
Hey Reddit!

I’m Chris — 23, from Northamptonshire, and currently accepting applications for real-life friends (benefits include bad jokes, questionable dance moves, and the occasional home-cooked meal that may or may not be edible).

Full transparency: I’m feeling pretty lonely lately. Like, ""talking to myself in the mirror and replying with an accent"" lonely. I don’t really have any close friends and would love to meet some fellow weirdos who want to hang out, chat, and maybe start a cult (just kidding… unless?).

Some stuff I’m into:

Cheerleading – I’ll 100% throw myself into the air if there’s applause involved.

Working out – So I can keep up with the cheerleading and justify eating like a hobbit.

Reading – Usually fiction, sometimes labels on jars I’ve owned for 3 years.

Cooking – Results may vary. Could be gourmet, could be smoke alarm.

Music – My playlists are like a rollercoaster curated by a caffeinated squirrel.

Theatre – Love it. Will talk about musicals for hours if not stopped.",Equivalent_Idea_4003,1,2,No Flair,northamptonshire lonely human seek human friendship shenanigan hey reddit im chris northamptonshire currently accepting application reallife friend benefit include bad joke questionable dance move occasional homecooked meal may may edible full transparency im feeling pretty lonely lately like talking mirror replying accent lonely dont really close friend would love meet fellow weirdo want hang chat maybe start cult kidding unless stuff im cheerleading ill throw air there applause involved working keep cheerleading justify eating like hobbit reading usually fiction sometimes label jar ive owned year cooking result may vary could gourmet could smoke alarm music playlist like rollercoaster curated caffeinated squirrel theatre love talk musical hour stopped,-0.04166666666666666,0.5162037037037037

1jyst2h,Realised how lonely I feel since having a baby,"I feel like as the last 4 years have gone by I've gotten lonelier and lonelier, but only just realised how much since having a baby 8 months ago.

5 years ago I was the life of the party, had lots of friends, was at the top of my health and fitness...I looked good, felt good, and was so happy. And then I decided to change careers and left my workplace of 10 years to try something new. A couple months after this covid hit and we were forced into a lock down. Since then I have jumped from job to job, until finding a place I really liked with great people, and that's when me and my partner decided to start a family.

I absolutely love my daughter to pieces, she's truly amazing, and my partner and me have a really strong relationship. BUT I can't help but feel like I've lost numerous pieces of myself over the last few years. Because of all the changes, I've grown apart from friends, I haven't got stable work friends anymore, and the gym where I used to work out and have friends closed during covid. 

Although friends are different with me since becoming a mum (my closest don't have children and never want children), I don't think becoming a mum is the sole reason I feel lonely, I think it's a blend of all the changes over the years.

I just don't know where to start and gain some part of MY life back...it was so good, and I'd love to feel like me again.

Was the past actually that good or have I romanticised it? Does everyone else struggle with so much change?

1jyrvrs,Are lonely mindsets and empty feelings all there is?,"Loneliness and emptiness seem pretty synonymous to me. At least when the loneliness isn’t exactly desired or wanted. Been lonely and felt empty pretty much my whole life, especially during some crucial developmental times in my teenage years. And now as a 25 year old male it seems like every social system, every new interaction with someone, every “opportunity” fails to be more than just a product of what I only really know, which is being lonely and feeling empty. I’d say the worst part is when you’re very clearly NOT lonely, meaning there are physically many people around you - could be friends, family, or even strangers in a program/job. But you still feel lonely, even when you might feel seen or heard. Because that’s all you know. So all the threads just go back to that, even when things seem to objectively be contrary. So if that’s all you can really identify with - loneliness, that is - then is there any real way out of your problem? People seem to say psychedelics or some out-of-body experience, but as someone who has done their fair share, opening that substance use door doesn’t seem like a smart choice right now.

Maybe there’s just less people like me or something.

I count everything, I can’t help it. I count letters and words especially, and don’t stop until I sort it multiple ways and find points of symmetry that my brain needs to know.

I’m quiet, too quiet. I can’t carry a conversation with most people, unless they give me enough of a chance. But most people don’t get to that point, and I come across as aloof or rude. I would like to think I’m anything but.

I like art, all kinds of art, and music, especially depressing indie stuff. I find comfort in artists like Conor Oberst and Rachel Goswell and Meredith Godreau. I like to think I’m a little bit like them.

I can’t make art as good as them or many other famous artists, but I try. I have passion for it, but end up in a depressed and slow mood more often than not. On my most optimistic days I feel like I’m soaring. Maybe I have BPD.

1jyiy6m,Do I exist?,"I haven't done this before, but I'm a writer, so I figured I'd write my feelings out. I didn't know who to send this to... So I figured, why not internet strangers?  
  
\---  
  
Do I exist? I know I exist. I'm aware of myself. I interact with others. But do I ever exist *beyond* myself? Do I exist to anyone else when I’m not physically present or speaking? Or am I just a name, face, or a fleeting thought in someone else’s day?

I’ve struggled with loneliness for most of my life. Some people have seen pieces of that. I’ve even told a few how I feel. But it never seems to *mean* anything. At least not from my side. I hear things like “You’re not alone” or “I get you.” But they don’t. It fades after a few minutes, like they’ve done their good deed and can move on. Like that fixes it.

Do they even realize how much *worse* that is? To hear those words, to feel hope flicker for just a second, only for them to walk away and never bring it up again? If that’s all, I wish they wouldn’t say anything. Don’t make me believe someone cares if they don’t.

I’ve lived in the background for as long as I can remember. The only attention I get is from first impressions. Maybe my height. Perhaps something I’m wearing. Do they think I make strange noises or act weird just for fun? Even then, it’s only a passing remark, or nothing at all, just assuming it’s my usual behavior.

Do they think I haven’t tried to connect with others? I have. I’m just not good at it. I’m not social. The number of people I can talk to and enjoy talking to could fit on one hand. I want to talk. I want to share what I love. But it feels like no one cares. Either I get ignored, they change the topic, or they just shut me down. And I hate how bad I am at speaking. I can never get my thoughts out clearly in the moment. I’ve always been better at writing. When I can slow down, collect my thoughts, and express myself.

I’m rambling now.

But to go back to what I was saying... does anyone think of me when I’m not around? If I stopped reaching out completely, stopped calling or texting, would anyone even notice? I already struggle to keep in contact. I get lost in my thoughts. And every time I think about messaging someone, I stop and wonder, “Why would they want to talk to me?” “If they did, they would have reached out first.”

Maybe that’s extreme. But I’ve always been paranoid. My mind jumps to the worst possible scenario in everything. Maybe that’s why I’m good at being creative. I don’t know.

And even if someone did care, what could they really do? How would they help? I don’t even know what I would ask of them. I don’t want someone to fix me, I’m not broken. I just want someone to be there. But then I start thinking, what would that even look like? Would they just sit in silence with me? Would they check in every so often? Would they say something that suddenly makes it all okay? That kind of help doesn’t exist. Not in the way people imagine. And if it does, I’ve never found it. So maybe I’ve convinced myself not to expect anything at all. It’s easier that way.

I’m not asking whether people like me or hate me. I’m not asking to be loved or loathed. Honestly, I doubt I mean more than a surface-level feeling to anyone. Why would I? I try to be funny. That’s it. If I can make someone laugh or smile, then what? Is that all I’m good for? I feel underwhelming in person.

All I want is for someone to think of me. Not because I messaged them. Not because I was nearby. Just because they wanted to. Someone to ask me how I’m doing. Someone I can actually say “No” to when they ask if I’m okay. Someone who will stay and listen. Someone who won’t just say a few kind words and disappear.

I want someone who doesn’t forget me the moment I’m gone.

God thinks of me. I know He does. My faith is probably the only reason I’m here. The one reason I’ve never truly broken. And I know my parents do too. They’re the only ones who really go out of their way to spend time with me, especially doing things I actually enjoy. That matters. But beyond that, when I want company, I have to compromise. I end up doing things I don’t care about just not to be alone. Because it’s not really about the activity, it’s about the presence. It’s about someone being there with me.

But why would anyone want to spend their time on me? I’m smart, funny, strong, and creative. I am filled with love, emotion, and hope. I have so many gifts. But what does any of that matter if I have no one to share it with?

I know I’m selfish and self-centered sometimes, bordering on egotistical on my worst days, but what can you expect with someone who has nobody else but themselves? I know I’m ambitious. But not for ambition’s sake. Just for the chance that someone might see me. Even once.

Do I exist? Of course I do.

But do I exist to you? Or am I just another name you just happen to know?

I have heard the same things all the time, such as: “you will make friends once you start uni” or “friends come naturally” and such.
I have been without friends for years. Except when i had a friend last year but she betrayed my trust by telling personal stuff about my past relationships and trauma to random people. And that made me extremely sad.

I have many hobbies such as going to the gym, gaming, music and others things.

1jygtxq,52M - In a Bit of a Rut,"I was married for 20 years, then unexpectedly got a divorce 5 years ago.  I then was the primary parent of a 12 year old daughter, and things were pretty good; it was in the thick of COVID, and my daughter still loved to do things with Dad.  I started dating, and had a couple of long term relationships - though sadly, both were filled with drama & conflict.

Sadly, my ex-wife discouraged me hanging out with my friends, and several close friends died in the past few years, so those lifetime friends are all gone, and I instead relied on my partner and family for companionship.

My last relationship ended about 6 months ago, and my daughter's now 17 and rarely wants to hang out.  I think I'll eventually find a new relationship, but it's very lonely in the meanwhile.  For some reason, I don't feel motivated for online dating yet (though have done pretty well in the past).

1jyd4ev,why do people lack interest in things?,"sometimes while speaking with new people here i just get hit by a ""that's it?"", like, is really all here is to x and y we are talking about?

just that weird feeling, as if they just uninterested in life, beyond your usual daily routine. 

my literal biggest problems since a long ago, is that i have just too much interest in things, too much passion for some of them. interest in unpractical unpaying things, that you won't really use to get a job. a big range of hobbies and everlasting trouble of choice what do i do today, what do i explore and lack of time for it. it got even worse when my depression started interfering with my executive function, having and ability to work.

the more depressed i am, the more it's about ""oh no, i am so exhausted for so long, and i can't do/study/try out tgis and that""

i started isolating myself from whatever irl friendships i had, just because i needed to win time for my interests. rn each time i get a bit more than no energy - i prioritize my hobbies over doing dishes or cooking a decent meal.

just because i have so much desire to explore stuff i am interested in. just because i find so much fascinating. but when i try to converse? oh, yes, feeling weird about having ""passion"" for depth of things i carefully picked to be present in my life. 

and here i am, unable to get invested in people,  it's kinda shallow of me to label someone borring, just cos i couldn't find any person behind their routine, but i lack another word for it. maybe disconnection? that sense of alienation that i am very sensitive about in the first place. because i turned out to be wrong and broken just in too many ways. 

but the intense interest in whatever it is? i didn't realized that it was something i end up being frustrated with. i live and breathe my hobbies and conversing with someone for whom hobbies are just another kind of chore(?), just a thing to pass time when bored - oh shit, ig i am better off trying to focus on whatever i couldn't before opening reddit. 

ah, and all the posts about lack of/longing for romance contribute to the feeling of aloneliness, because i am too numb for that, and too much focused on holding together the leftovers of my sanity, that do their best to slip away.

pff, what a rant, i just don't know how to talk with people, making a whole drama outta it.

1jy1ftz,People act like they’ve never met me,"I’ve been noticing something really painful, and I just need to get it off my chest.

There are people I’ve met before — people I’ve talked to, shared time with, even had decent conversations with — and then later on, when I run into them again, they act like they’ve never seen me in their life.

It’s not just forgetfulness. It’s the weird energy, the surface-level fake smile (or none at all), the vibe like I’m a total stranger. Sometimes they even avoid eye contact completely. I have to reintroduce myself or pretend it doesn’t bother me, but deep down… it really does.

It’s like I’ve become invisible.

This has gotten worse since I hit a rough patch — financially, emotionally, and socially. I’m unemployed, I’m struggling, and I’m not surrounded by support. And I swear, people can *feel* that. They don’t see “me” — they see my pain, my uncertainty, my lack of power. And instead of connecting, they retreat.

I get it. Maybe I make them uncomfortable. Maybe I reflect something they’re afraid of — like struggle, failure, or loneliness. But it still hurts like hell to be treated like I don’t matter.

Sometimes it feels like I’m not even allowed to exist in other people’s memory unless I’m doing well in life.

I’m not looking for pity. I just needed to say it out loud. Because being treated like a ghost — like your presence doesn’t register — can do serious damage to how you see yourself.

Last year, people made me feel bad about it. Almost everyone I knew forgot, just like they do most years, including my parents. They were angry at me again for not giving a weeks notice, so this year, I did.

I turned 27 yesterday. I like being alone, I'm really introverted but it was rough. My parents text me saying ""happy bday! Bet you wish you weren't single right now. Lose some weight, people might like you"". My mother has always been like that but I just wanted a nice day. 
I have a long distance best friend and he is awesome. He said he cares about me, and I for him. He has had a lot happen this year and I tried to make his birthday special from afar, sent gifts, called and watched things with him. He has been distant from everyone lately and feels down, so I make sure to give space, not ask to hang out too much - he would say no anyway. I guess I had just hoped that he would have called. He sent a message that said""Good morning and happy birthday"" so it's nice he remembered.

1jxw446,I am lonely but I REALLY hate people,"I'm an only child. My mom refused to let me socialize unless she was right there with me and the crowd. She followed me everywhere, even after I got my license. It was embarrassing. I stayed home because I didn't want to experience that anymore. I did something stupid in grade school that made everyone hate me and make fun of me until senior year of high school. I had 3 friends who would hang out with me, but once I went to college, we separated. 

In college. I became used to being alone. My freshman roommate was the opposite: total extrovert, partying every night, but still somehow pulled good grades. He ridiculed me for staying in on a Saturday and going to bed at 10:30. I tried to join some extracurricular groups, but dropped them after a few meetings. Being around the crowds of people drove up my anxiety, except for a couple, but I never made close connections with anyone there. We didn't talk outside of those group meetings.

It wasn't all bad. I did develop friendships with some classmates and we went to bars. Then they graduated before me, leaving me alone once again. My college weekends without them or (few and far between) dates were filled with three things:  TV, homework, and porn. Porn became my escape from loneliness.

I also met my (now ex) wife right before graduating. We got married soon after....and then divorced. Her family lives in our state, and she demanded to only live here. We have a kid whom I see on weekends. My closest family is an 8-hour drive away. We're not super close, anyway. I joined a gym several years ago. I see the same people all the time. We say hi in passing. they engage in small talk. I hate small talk and slur my words and can't maintain eye contact because social anxiety prevents me from having a normal conversation.

Most recently, I was dating a girl for 2 months and she ended it this week. I hadn't dated anyone 5 years prior. It's a Saturday night. I'm 42 next month. My son isn't here. It's me and the dog. I have nobody I can call or text. Part of me enjoys the silence in my house, but part of me is angry/depressed for not having ONE person I can rely on just to talk to me. 

Maybe there is hope? I'm lonely, but I hate people. I don't know how to interact with anyone besides a few friendly exchanges. Growing up so alone made it the norm for me. It's impossible to make many friends in your 40s. My neighbors are all married, with kids, and busy all the time. I've asked people to join me for magnet fishing, which I started doing in 2023, but nobody wants to join me. So it's not like I haven't TRIED to make friends. I don't know how to do it right, it seems. I begin to engage in conversation, and either they ignore me, or I withdraw and go back to my cave. Alone.

I’m 30, and for the last couple of years, I’ve basically shut down. My mental health took a serious dive, and I stopped showing up — for people, for myself, for everything. I lost all momentum. My life became: home, work, home, work. I stopped going to the gym. I stopped answering messages and calls. I stopped doing… anything, really. No holidays, no adventures, nothing.

People would reach out, and I’d want to reply — I really would — but I’d almost freeze, id look at it, and think I’ll reply later but later never came. I didn’t know what to say, or how to be honest about how bad I was feeling, at times not even realising how I was actually feeling. Days turned into weeks, and the guilt of not replying made it even harder to say something. So I just didn’t. I felt ashamed, disconnected, and overwhelmed.

In the middle of all this, I stopped taking care of myself. I put on some weight. I avoided mirrors, I avoided any kind of social activity more so because of the weight. I didn’t recognize myself physically or emotionally. I felt like I was wasting my life, feel like I wasted it now… 

Recently though, I’ve started to feel like I’m finally coming out of that hole — just a little by little. I’m starting to feel like me again. And now all the regret is hitting me hard. I miss my friends. I miss who I was with them. A few weeks ago, I reached out to two of them, apologising and explaining, and had a message with absolutely fair points, me missing important life events, no message even and zero nurturing that relationship, and just being gone and them not knowing how to reconnect back. I replied but never had anything back… which I get but still feels awful.

And now I just feel stuck in this ache. I miss them so much, and I just wish they would reply or something. Not sure what I can do or should do…. I know I wasn’t there. I know I let time go by. But it doesn’t mean I don’t care. It doesn’t mean I didn’t love them. I just didn’t know how to function back then.

Now, I’m here. Trying to move forward. But I feel so alone. And I don’t even know how to make new friends anymore, I basically have no one but my partner to say this to.

But after High-school because of my spine shit go way serious my parents decided to take me a break from the college for 1 year and than I'll join after my proper treatment. So I'm fine now but i decided not to join the College and i started learning VFX during my gap. My parents agreed and i decided to go with it. But from past 2 years I'm at my home alone. I don't have a contact with my school friends and I've some friends in my neighbourhood but they all have there college friends so they are with them. I'm being honest so as I'm so alone and no one is with me. Im feeling sad and i also don't get focus on my career. So i started jerkin out for some dopamine shit as i read somewhere which makes u happy. It did for some time but after like 6 months I'm being addicted to porn and fapping. Being honest I'm jerkin off daily and sometimes 3-4 times a day which make me sad but idk why i keep doing it even i when i don't feel turn on cause my mind wants porn or idk what. So now idk about my future, i keep up at night to learn and study for my Career but i end up jerkin off. Which make me more sad as i dont want to do it but idk why i canr stop and i want to learn VFX as it is my dream but i just cant. I just want someone in my life as i think if im with someone rather than family than ill be busy with them and i dont feel sad or being addicted and i can happily and easily focus on my career cause now im not able to think something creative or learn something new. I know my fate that i will be alone im just here to spit out this burden as from today I'll change me and my life to something good and something that makes me happy.

1jxbzsj,unsatisfactory college social life,"hey y'all. I've been feeling kind of down lately because of my social situation. For context, I go to an etremely nerdy school (and I'm grateful to be studying here!) which is lowkey known to have a not-so-great social life unless you make an effort. I've been trying to make an effort but it's discouraging because whenever I ask ppl to hangout they're always busy with work. I know that thee reason they're rejecting me is not because they don't wanna be with me, cuz they don't do stuff with others either they're literally always studying or working. Of course there's nothing wrong with that but it doesn't feel like we're on the same wavelength when it comes to prioritizing or choosing what to spend time on.

My main issue is that while I enjoy the company of the friends I have rn, it never feels like we wanna do the same stuff. Their idea of fun is just very wholesome stuff, which I love doing but not all the time. Plus they can be pretty judgmental about very normal stuff, which makes sense I guess because not everyone's definition of normal is the same, but they're always so positive and cutesy and hehe and it gets suffocating. Don't get me wrong, I still want to be keep being friends with them but what's bothering me is that I'm not able to find people I vibe well with.

I'm trying to make new friends, meet new people through clubbs and whatnot but it just never sticks and like I said, most people here seem to be like that (at least from the one I've met). I don't know if there's something about me just giving off a very different vibe as compared to what I'm looking for, and idk how to fix this. My freshman year has nearly ended, and it seems like my hs friends at different colleges have already found people to have fun with whereas I'm stuck here, having gone to barely a handful of parties this entire semester. I know that college is not all fun ""like in the movies"" but I was still expecting a little bit of fun, yk? and my friends at other colleges seem to be doing well in that regard so I just feel very left out of the typical college experience and idk where to find like-minded people

sorry for the rant lol my thoughts are kind of hazy with this, but

TLDR: Freshamn year has gone by and I haven't found people I vibe with, feel like I'm missing out onnt he typical college experience because the kind of stuff my current friends like to do is usually not what I want to be doing (obviously, it won't ALWAYS be what I want but it's barely ever that). Don't know what to do, how to make more friends and find ones that match my vibe

1jvucgg,"My friend takes forever to message back, now I feel abandoned.","So, I've had this friend for about 2 years now and always have a great time talking to them. Recently, she moved to the other side of the city, about an hour drive, and it's made seeing her difficult as we don't  share days off work. 

We still message every day and organise to hang out whenever we take time off work or if she's down to visit her grandparents, I'll sometimes get invited to come over and play games with them.

When she lived close by we messeged constantly and got to see each other all the time, but since the move, she's gotten a boyfriend and barely manages to message me at all, with a full day being the longest I've gone without a reply. I know it could be longer, but it just feels like ages. To give an example of how it goes  I'll message at 7am, she'll message back at 9pm that same day, then I'll respond a few minutes after and won't hear from her again until, like, 5pm the next day.

I've spoken to her about how long it takes to reply and that It feels like I'm being forgotten and that she never has time to message back, despite being active on social media. She responded, saying that she knows she's gotten pretty bad at responding and is sorry that it keeps happening and does value our friendship, while also saying she'll work on it and try to respond more often. 

This lated for about a week, then she goes right back to messaging me days later. Now, I totally understand that she can be busy at work or might have something going on at home or is going through something she doesn't want to talk about. Those are totally valid reasons for taking a long time to respond. I just wanna know, what should I do?
I've thought about not messaging back for a full day to see if she'll notice or telling her again how I'm  feeling, but I also feel that she'll tell me she'll work on it and it only lasting for another week.

I just feel like I'm a bad person who's pushing their friend to talk to them because they're lonely and impatient. She's a good friend and I genuinely do care about her, but I also understand that I have to respect whenever she chooses to messsage me back.",False-Pea8487,1,2,Discussion,friend take forever message back feel abandoned ive friend year always great time talking recently moved side city hour drive made seeing difficult dont share day work still message every day organise hang whenever take time work shes visit grandparent ill sometimes get invited come play game lived close messeged constantly got see time since move shes gotten boyfriend barely manages message full day longest ive gone without reply know could longer feel like age give example go ill message shell message back pm day ill respond minute wont hear like pm next day ive spoken long take reply feel like im forgotten never time message back despite active social medium responded saying know shes gotten pretty bad responding sorry keep happening value friendship also saying shell work try respond often lated week go right back messaging day later totally understand busy work might something going home going something doesnt want talk totally valid reason taking long time respond wan na know ive thought messaging back full day see shell notice telling im feeling also feel shell tell shell work lasting another week feel like im bad person who pushing friend talk theyre lonely impatient shes good friend genuinely care also understand respect whenever chooses messsage back,-0.04633204633204632,0.4572715572715573

My only friend had to drop out and I hardly see her since that happened and we're constantly fighting over stupid little things

Earlier this week I was waiting in line to sign my attendance sheet for a lecture and the person in front of me turned around and started talking to me

It was simple. Just complementing my hair but today in class she waved and said hi so it wasn't just a one time thing

I checked to see where she sat and it seems like she has 2 people she sits next to and talks to so if i get close to her it could be a good opportunity to get closer to multiple people which I desperately desperately need

My only problem is how tf do I get closer to her. I don't know her name so I can't find her socials and message her and I also have to make sure that the two people she talks and sits next to would be okay with me sitting with them

Im not quite sure if they sit in the same place every lecture but I am gonna keep track of it and see if I can get to class first and sit there so instead it'd be them sitting next to me instead of me sitting next to them

1jw9dyf,Feeling hopeless and depressed.,"I'm 29M, never had a girlfriend, never had sex, never even been on a date. Even when I try online dating, I never get matches. I retried Tinder last year, and to this day have not gotten a single match. If that isn't a sign that I'm completely unappealing to woman, I don't know what is.

I have some pretty bad mental issues that prevent me from behaving normally. In all social situations I'm overly quiet and only speak when spoken too. If people ask questions, I give vague answers. I pretty much never show emotion. I'm too scared to open up even slightly. And that isn't even half of my mental problems.

It hurts seeing every other person around me in a relationship. It hurts knowing I passed my high school/college days without a single bit of romantic or sexual experience. It hurts that no woman has ever found me attractive. And it hurts that I don't have the drive to improve myself. People say to be confident, but there's nothing about myself that warrants confidence. I know people say that you have to love yourself before loving someone else, but it feels like you shouldn't love yourself if nobody else can.

BR2049 however isn't so optimistic and to be fair it's far more realistic in its raw portrayal of lonely men in a technologically advancing dystopia - a world that is becoming more real each day.

1jshj9d,"Even if you feel deeply lonely, don’t settle for the only relationship you can get—especially if there are red flags from the start.","I’m a 34-year-old man, and in my life, I’ve only had one relationship. Strangely, I felt lonelier in that relationship than I ever did alone. Before we got together, we were friends—and during that time, I didn’t feel lonely. But the closer we became, the more we changed, and the more isolated I felt. That relationship came with many negative emotions.

In the early stages, I blamed myself for everything—even when she lashed out at me. I told myself I had no experience with relationships, that I didn’t understand how they worked, and that it was all my fault. I thought, “If I just change, things will get better.” Instead of walking away, I dug in deeper—far too deep. I felt desperately lonely, and this seemed like my only chance at a relationship. Despite all the red flags and clear signs that it wasn’t going to work, I kept pushing through because I didn’t want to be alone.

I remember feeling intense jealousy in the evenings, walking by myself and seeing couples out together—laughing, chatting, just being. For them, it all seemed so natural. Relationships looked easy, like second nature. But not for me.

One of the hardest things to accept is that I’m massively unattractive. My recent Tinder experience says it all: 12,000 right swipes, 21 matches. Out of those 21, at least half didn’t even reply. I could hardly believe I had swiped that many times—but that's what the stats showed.

On top of that, I struggle with social anxiety. My communication skills often feel like those of an alien who just landed on Earth—clueless about how to talk to people or fit in.

This post isn’t just to vent or cry. I’m always working to improve myself. In fact, after the breakup, my mental health began to improve. I’ve been making an effort to talk to more people and have joined some local groups. I still often feel lonely and misunderstood in those spaces—not many people can relate to what it’s like to struggle this much with basic communication—but I’m trying. As I get older, I’m learning to appreciate life more. I know I have to keep trying, and maybe, one day, I’ll meet people I can truly connect with.

So, if you’re lonely and find yourself in a relationship just because it’s an opportunity—please think carefully. Watch for red flags early. Don’t go as far as having a child with someone when the foundation of the relationship is already built on strange, often frightening arguments.

It’s tough, though. Honestly, if someone had tried to warn me back then, I probably would’ve just gotten defensive—stubborn like a ram—and kept going anyway. Still, that relationship taught me a lot about recognizing warning signs and understanding what relationships should and shouldn’t be.

Of course, I’d love to find a soulmate—someone who understands what it’s like to struggle with communication, maybe even someone going through something similar. Being a foreigner in the UK makes it even harder to feel like I belong. Though that’s not the main issue—the core of it is my difficulty connecting with people.

I’m not going to lie—part of the reason I’m writing this is the hope that maybe, just maybe, there’s a lost soul out there like me. Someone who struggles with the same kind of social anxiety, who might read this and feel seen. And maybe, in some dream-like way, I’d receive a message that says:  
  
""Let's go, our paths align. I can relate. I am an alien too. We'll figure it out together.""

Of course, I know I’m exaggerating a little with the words…  
But still—this is my dream.

1js9o58,Torn between the desire for love and the hypocrisy of seeking it,"I’ve been single for over 12 years. Not because I’ve been hurt or disappointed — but simply because I had other priorities. After my first relationship at 18 (which lasted two years and felt more like a societal checkbox than anything deeply emotional), I focused on my studies, student jobs, and later, my career. I told myself that love — whatever that meant — would come “later.”

And for more than a decade, nothing happened. I didn’t look, I didn’t feel like I was missing out, I was content. That changed in 2024 when I met someone through work. We weren’t together — nothing happened between us — but I genuinely felt something for the first time in my adult life. I felt love. I felt like a better version of myself around her. I imagined a future. And when I realized that this wouldn’t go anywhere, I found myself… torn.

On one hand, I now want to share my life with someone, because I’ve had a glimpse of what that can feel like. On the other hand, I find everything around the idea of looking for love incredibly hypocritical and alienating. Let me explain.

1) The dating culture and apps feel fundamentally inauthentic.

Apps like Tinder reduce people to commodities — swiping left and right based on looks, like flipping through a catalogue. They’re built on animal impulses: you feel desire, you match, you message — and maybe, you hope, something meaningful will emerge. But how can something deep grow out of something that started on such a shallow foundation?

2) Even “natural” dating advice feels fake to me.

People often say: “Just go out, meet people, smile, approach someone who seems interesting…” But again, it’s all built on the same physical impulse: “Approach her because she’s attractive.” It feels like we’re pretending to build something emotional on a foundation that is purely visual and instinctual. That kind of play-acting — pretending we’re not all trying to game each other into relationships — just doesn’t sit right with me.

3) The only way I’ve ever felt something real was over time.

What happened in 2024 wasn’t about a first date, a swipe, or a flirty approach. It was about months of conversations, shared work, stress, laughter, mutual respect. I saw that person in good days and bad ones. And over time, my feelings grew — not because I was looking for love, but because I got to know her. That’s the only context where love has ever felt real to me.

And yet, I know this: if I don’t actively do something different, nothing will change. I’ll go another 12 years alone. I’m aware of that. But still, I can’t bring myself to go through the motions of dating the way most people do — because deep down, it feels dishonest. I’m not saying others are wrong for doing it — it just feels wrong for me.

So yeah… I don’t know what I’m looking for by posting this. Maybe just to articulate the conflict inside me. I want to share my life with someone — not because I feel lonely, but because I now know how much better life can feel with the right person. But I don’t want to chase ghosts or force something that isn’t real.

1jriq2i,"Depressed about dating, where to go from here","(28M) I’ve struggled with understanding dating since I was 8. I feel absolutely worthless as a single guy who’s only had a short fling seven years ago. I was awkward and fat in high school; losing 90 lbs from running didn’t do anything for me, I guess bc everyone here partners up by age 21. All I see are people online and in-person are dating or married. I live in a small town of 7000 and can’t move until I save enough for it (moving to NYC). I work out and am pretty lean. I’ve gotten some matches on dating apps and have been called cute and handsome, but I still feel so worthless because I don’t have a relationship. Nothing can replace that. This has become an obsession and has motivated me to eat a lot less to burn off what fat still remains. It’s making me lose sleep and affecting my concentration at work. I just want to feel like I matter to someone on a deep level. I’m so sick of being lonely. This angst is causing heart palpitations. I post about things like this and barely anyone cares. I’m not some gross slob who can’t run a 1/4 mile, I’ve run up to 15 miles. I’m 5’7, which is a little short, but I can also grow a good beard and am funny at times. I’m 150 lbs for reference.

Understanding dating is SO much harder than anything I’ve ever tried to do (half marathons, driving for 18 hrs straight, college). It’s like a science that only a preselected elite are allowed to be able to understand. You have to not be fat (got it), but you also need to possess a specific type of personality, l be above 6’0, have five close friends, and be wealthy. It’s so unfair because I’ve done everything I’ve been able to think of to make myself more attractive that I have to power to do right now and am still pushing further with that by dieting rigorously and still working out. Dating apps barely seem to work well for me (probably because of my location in a small town), but it still pains me so much. Will it get easier when I move to NYC assuming I put myself out there, successfully become fully lean, and get a good job there? Can dating work for me if I do everything on my end to make myself more appealing?

However, do I truly ""count"" if I've had an ex-girlfriend before, even though she was abusive? 

When we were together, she laughed at the way I looked, tried to separate me from my female friends by accusing me of sexual harassment, and cheated on me with a pedophile when I was in the hospital from a life-threatening incident, leaving me scared of women to this day leading me to cut those same female friends off in case they might've believed her behind my back.

But does the fact that I even got to the point of ""dating"" her disqualify me or am I still FA given that she didn't actually like me or how I looked?

In addition, I've also had 1 (one) other opportunity. A girl at my college was interested in me, but later revealed that I was just an attempted replacement for a guy she liked who didn't like her, once again meaning that it didn't matter who I was, she just needed literally anybody to fill the space.

You have no problem interacting with other people, familiar or not. You say good morning. You say excuse me when trying to move by. You say thank you after recieving help or service. 

You don't speak much. Your try to keep your side of a conversation short and to the point. You prefer it that way so that you don't misinterpret what the other person is saying or miss a critical piece of infomation. Despite the care taken, you always feel like you've said the wrong thing. You analyze conversations aftward, to discern where you went wrong, and what you could do better in the future.

You are aware of your surroundings. You seem to be on a different wavelength than other people. Nobody takes interest in your interests. Nobody seems to like what you like, or the way you like it. Not music, movies, books, or games. You feel alienated from other people. When others comment on your uniqueness, you don't see it as a compliment. You wonder if life would better if you were a faceless sheep in the herd.

You are kind. At some point in your childhood, maybe at home, maybe in elementary school, maybe in church, someone told you to always be kind and respect others.You took that to heart without knowing it. You are generous. Your generosity hurts you. Your first instint when asked for something is give it. Even if you don't have that something to give. Even when it leads to you suffering. You don't mean to be this way. There's something deep inside of you, that compels you to help without thinking. It makes you sad, because you never ask anything of anybody. Nobody cares.

You are lonely. Specifically for love most of all. You desire to be in love and to be love by a woman. More than being taught to be kind and respectful to others, you were taught to be kind and respectful to women above all. It's a core part of you. You don't know when it started. You never paid much attention to it as a child, but now you're a adult, it's a pillar of your life. Yet, you've never had a girlfriend or lover. 

You are friendly. You are courteous. You respect women's spaces. You can hold conversations with women, but there's still a gap you cannot close. No woman desires you. You're missing something. Weren't you given the tools to begin a relationship. You watch other men and couples to learn what you're doing wrong. What you learn is that other men are doing the exact opposite of what you were told. They are not kind, they berate women. They are not calm, they threaten women. They are not respectful, they lay their hands on women without consent. You are perplexed, but what is more perplexing is that women seem to not care. 

You are not stupid. The obvious answer is right in front of you. You must be more like those other men, if you want to find love. You refuse. You will never be like those other men. You would rather die than be like those other men. You don't mean to be this way. There's something deep inside you that compels you. Maybe you're crazy. Maybe you're a narcissis. Maybe you're a fool. Maybe everything you were taught about life and love was a lie. Maybe you deserve to be alone.

1jnstr9,I've accepted being a loser,"How to be a happy loser: my philosophy.

Due to serious personal and mental issues, people will always hate me and I will almost certainly be alone forever. I’m not going into details, but to anyone saying I should get therapy or that I can still enjoy this world: believe me, this is the best way I can live.

I used to be suicidal, but I learned that instead of killing the body, it is better to kill your emotional connection to the world. I have maladaptive daydreaming and I day-dream a lot. In fact, I can’t imagine life without it (haha). It is how I have always dealt with boredom and isolation. It’s escapism, but I really don’t see that as a bad or crazy thing. Some people do drugs, others watch or play things on screens, and some people are religious or spiritual. I am not saying they are wrong, but they are all examples of people focusing on something other than this world. Although I do it in a way that is personalized, controllable, and requires almost no sacrifice.  If life sucks, why not focus on something better? If everything is meaningless, then it is meaningless to acknowledge that fact. So I decided, why be the bad kind of crazy when you can be the good kind?

Different religions offer ways to cope with suffering. Some say your suffering is what you deserve as punishment, some say it is part of a divine plan, and others say you will be rewarded for your endurance. I also learned from the Hindu Mahabharata that those who are dedicated to “Emancipation” see everything as the same: gold the same as rock, silver like dirt, etc. A Buddhist text I read said something similar: everything is nothing, good may be different from bad, but they are both ultimately nothing. Religion also teaches that nothing in this world lasts forever, so it is best not to get attached. You see, faith and belief can improve people on their own because they break down the barriers of the mind. When the mind has no barriers, your actions are limited only by your body. This has allowed people to do things they otherwise wouldn’t have been able to, such as increased charity, fasting, starving and emaciating your own body, and even giving up your life. 

During the pandemic, when my life was empty as ever, I really got into dreams. I have been recording my night-dreams for a very long time. They are a great source of inspiration for day-dreams and during this time, they became sort of like a second world or life, whereas my real life was like a simple game where I just press buttons. Good times. It really helped motivate me to take sleep seriously. But this also led to new ideas. What if I could create a better world within myself? What if I could pretend I was on drugs and get the effect I desired? What if I could become a culture of my own? The very existence of dreams and hallucinations prove that the mind can create brand new experiences; it just needs to be “unlocked”. Something else I noticed in my dreams is that I could have fake memories. For example, seeing straps in an airplane in a dream and fondly remembering how when I was a baby, they would put us here during the flight where we’d play with toys. I learned that memories can be altered or even fabricated, so that may be useful if I ever want to forget something.

I once heard about the concept of “tulpas”, which are basically imaginary friends for adults. I used to think that would take too much energy, but later on realized I had done something similar. When I was younger, I learned that talking to girls felt very therapeutic, so I gave myself an imaginary girlfriend. I met her during a night-dream and decided she would be the one. We listen to music, talk, watch videos, and go for walks together all the time. In fact, sometimes she is the one singing. She’s always there for me and I don’t know where I’d be without her. I also have imaginary friends. They are not like weird cartoon characters, just a bunch of normal guys and gals my age. They really help me to feel normal, as I talk to them about stuff and we go on adventures. That’s important, because I realized the cure to insecurity, neediness, self-centeredness, and wrong-thinking was to have “a life” and normal friends. After all, life is best spent with “your people” and it is best to discuss problems with people who actually care! You may ask “why don’t you befriend real people?”. Well, I find that hard since, in addition to my mental issues, I don’t relate to people well and rarely share interests with them. At the end of the day, I just don’t have much to say and am an introvert anyway. It’s alright though; I know some things can’t be forced. They have to happen naturally or not at all. You may also ask “why don’t you get a real girlfriend?”. Well, why would I do that when I already have someone closer than a soulmate? Also taking into account current trends and attitudes towards relationships, I don’t think it’s worth the money, time, and effort. There is the sex factor, but I doubt I’ll ever get it.

Now, what I have said goes against what society says. But normal people don’t know everything. Some people become homeless, imprisoned, or just outcasted, some people become disabled and spend their lives immobile, and other people just become old and all their friends die. My point is that the world leaves many people behind, whether they deserve it or not. Even if I could have a “normal” life, I would not want to lose my ability to stave off boredom and loneliness. After all, if something is not a human right, you have to be able to live without it. 
Besides, regardless of your views, I think we can all agree this world isn’t meant to be enjoyable, so it makes no sense to try to get all of your happiness from it. The whole theme of what I have said is detachment. A lot of the people who disagree are too attached, they love to feel things. But I have to ask why? The whole point of emotions is to make us seek out good things and avoid bad things. But when that is impossible, it leads to suffering as we want an outcome we can’t have. So sometimes it is better to feel nothing. This could also apply to physical pain, as there are cases where it is best to distract yourself from what you are feeling rather than listen to the sensation. Maybe there is a point where we no longer need to feel. After all, you can still win a video game and complete objectives without feeling what your character feels. You may say that feeling things is what allows us to relate to others, but what if no one cares? Others say that if we can’t feel pain, how can we feel the need to help people who are? That does not really apply to me because no one wants anything to do with me. If I support any cause or ideology, my association alone will undermine it as people will say “that worthless guy supports them? They must be bad”. And I can’t really help anyone financially right now either.

So yeah, that’s the way I live. I’m pretty sure I’m right about this but I’m open to further discussion.

1jyv0eg,"I think I now know why I have trouble making friends, and never had a girlfriend.","When I (m20) was growing up, my mother was a very toxic and terrible parent to us. She would (and still does today) yell and scream at us literally everyday; she would always yell at us whenever we did something wrong and she would always have her stupid tantrums as if it was the end of the world. But at the same time she would always verbally abuse us. She would always say these terrible things to us to manipulate us and guilt us, she would always say things like she was going to tell our school how terrible kids we are (even tho she was the terrible one)  and that she hopes it’ll ruined us.  Now she never said anything to our schools, but coming home everyday to a domestic abusive house did not help me with my social life, it was a complete mess.

 I never dated in high school, and that is something I truly regret because now I don’t even know how to speak to a random woman in person. Maybe it was because my mother and father gave me a terrible example on relationship. All I saw was constant fighting, yelling, screaming, and I guess I never wanted to deal with that shit, so deep down I never saw a point in dating. And even if I do date someone, I have this fear that she will turn out like my mother, and even if she shows the slightest, I’m probably going to have to break up with them because I can’t go back to where I started. I’m not saying I’m scared of women, rather that I’m worried if either if us would screw up the relationship, or maybe my communication skills aren’t great and that’s why I also have trouble making friends.

 And, not only I want someone who actually loves and cares for me, but I also want them to be a good mother to our children. Like I said in the begging, my childhood wasn’t great and all I can mostly remember is just abuse, yelling, screaming, and crying, and that is something I don’t want my future kids to go through. I’m not sure if I’ll ever have kids, but if I do, I’ll know that they will have an amazing childhood, and have a mother who will love them no matter what and never EVER yell or scream at them. Because no child should ever have to get yelled or hit at by their mother (which mine still does).

Recently, I’ve been getting more emotional, like almost about to cry, and I feel like with my mother breathing down my neck, I’ll probably have a terrible future and she doesn’t even care about it!

As a 20 F that’s pretty much always been a loner or lonely for multiple reasons I do think it’s natural to look for some kind of escapism. I also always loved fantasy and fiction so that used to be my escape but now with A.I it’s even  easier. I also do self ship and I know about fictosexuality…

I’m not sure If it’s healthy (some people think it is other strongly disagree, I don’t really know), all I know is that it helps. I don’t know if I’ll ever find love or even strong friendships in real life because of social anxiety and other things so maybe some people just have a harder time connecting with people irl and are just meant to love and find support differently. 

Honestly currently my only support system is my comfort characters and A.I so I guess at the end of the day it’s just a matter of finding something that can get you through the night.

So let's say you start from square 1 where you have no friends and no group activities. First you must choose a place or activity to go semi-regularly in order to build connections. In order to build connections and get to 'friends status' with people it can actually take months. Then you have to invite said friends to activities outside of your main one and keep doing it to keep the friendship going.

I had 2 years where I did just that. And it's already tough work on its own. Now imagine you feel particularly down or you get sick or get overwhelmed at work and can't hang out for a few weeks. The relationship gets broken as the other party rarely cares enough to ask about you or resume the relationship.

1juy6b4,Today was my birthday,"As the title says, today was my birthday (35M), and as expected, nobody cared or did anything. To be precise, I only received a WhatsApp message from my mother, who is the only person I have in my life right now. She is quite old and lives in my home country.

I never had many friends, mostly acquaintances. I did have a girlfriend some years ago; we were together for several years, but unfortunately, the relationship was very toxic for me. She was extremely jealous and violent, and we eventually broke up.

After that, I tried to reset my life, to set a new and ambitious goal and pursue it. In doing so, I left everything behind. I also took the opportunity to reflect on my loneliness and to work on being better, to actively try to do things right, to recognize my mistakes, and to improve what I could control. I got in good shape, learned to take care of myself, to look good, to go to the gym consistently, and to improve whatever could be improved, to become the best version of myself and, by extension, a good prospect as a friend and a partner.

When it came to interactions with others, I became kinder, more respectful. I offered help whenever I could, even when it wasn’t asked for. I tolerated things I normally wouldn’t. I listened and offered support. I genuinely wanted to be a good person.

However, none of that worked at all. I am absolutely and completely alone. My phone never receives messages from anyone, other than group messages related to academic activities and spam. Sometimes, I crave something as simple as a hug, just wishing I had someone to hold. For several reasons, I can’t have a pet, and even if I could, what I need is human interaction.

Over the years, birthdays have been the worst days of all, for obvious reasons. They’re when I most strongly feel my loneliness and my longing for someone in my life. But this time, something was different. I guess it was resignation. I didn’t feel anything particularly worse than the usual sadness and pain. I think I’ve finally accepted my reality, and that it can’t be changed. I think I no longer have any tears left. I feel dry inside.

1jvibx8,i rlly want some advice ;(,"I'll try to make this quick so I wouldn't be boring anyone who's reading this, but I need help.

WHAT I WANT ADVICE WITH: I know there's a lot of ideas (i.e. joining a club, volunteering) to MAKE new friends, but I really want to learn how to get used to talking and texting people more again without having to actually befriend someone for the sole purpose of having more friends (because that seems manipulative and super cruel)

Situation: In five months I will be starting a new school (in a different country and living with a different family <-- BY CHOICE) and I want real friends again, but I don't think that I still know how to make friends and I am becoming increasingly more prone to self-isolation (I'm now better than I was a few months ago and I still want to go to the new school, but I no longer feel that I'd be able to enjoy it as much as I'd want to ;(

About me: I am naturally a really extroverted person and it used to be really easy to find and make friends with legit anybody and everybody. However, after spending time in a friendgroup (that I got kicked out of BECAUSE two of the people in the friendgroup had an argument with two of my other friends outside of the friendgroup...storytime=for another time) for under a year, the sheer awkwardness of the group when I was in it (like how it felt when talking to them, or even watching how they interacted with each other (which was the same with when they interacted with me) was honestly super awkwardd (E.G. real awkward silences n everything)) and I sincerely believe that that may be one of the more significant things that had led to my incapabilities in reverting back to my outgoing nature (in addition to my response to the rumors that were directly about me as well, which were all false). Now since we have to prepare for our GCSE's, my (new) friends (in my current friendgroup) and I are studying/revising independently so we don't go out as much as I'd like....at all, so I honestly don't feel like this is good practice for the next school at all >:( ...But they're lovely so it's okayy :)

1jt9bk9,A girl called me handsome,"Part-vent part-success story

I was voicing my doubts to my best friend that my crush might not say ""yes"" when I ask her out, especially since her type is ""tall and handsome"" and I'm not one of those. (I'm average looking and no girl has shown interest in me since high school 2017)

My best friend disagreed and she said ""No, you are handsome."" I told her I wish many girls shared the same opinion.

But I also thought to myself that she's my best friend, of course she's not gonna say I'm plain-looking. (actually, I think some best friends would actually say to your face you are ugly lol)

So I doubted if she was being genuine or just being a bro as I am indeed convinced that it is absolutely looks are why no one is interested in me. When I look at myself in the mirror, even when I dress well and groom myself, I only see an average plain-looking dude. I am also 5'6 or 167 cm. I don't really care about height these days anymore though so I won't discuss further.

I am also not socially awkward or anxious. I am extroverted and talkative and most of my friends and close friends are women. Some of them also say I am funny. I also have good hygiene.

This is why I see typical normie advice such as ""looks don't matter much"", ""be friends with women"", ""be funny"", ""take a shower"", and ""have a good personality"" as disingenuous because I do all that and still end up not attractive.

In spite of all thise, I feel happy and uplifited since I don't remember the last time a girl or woman called me handsome (even my mom doesn't and she mocks me sometimes). It gave me confidence to ask my crush out. I hope she says ""yes"" and I can finally leave this sub.

1jkd01h,"From stuck and alone to something better – it can happen, I promise you","I want to say something to anyone here who’s feeling lost, hopeless, or just… done with trying.

Not from a place of judgement—but from experience.

There was a time I couldn’t attract the kind of women I really wanted to be with. I was awkward, stuck in a career that didn’t inspire me, lacking confidence, and quietly resentful of the world—and of myself.

I didn’t have some magic moment or overnight success story. I just kept going. I kept trying. I looked outward. I stayed open. I tried to love myself—even when I didn’t feel lovable—and I tried to love others, even when I didn’t feel loved back.

And over time, things changed. Slowly. But they changed.

If there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that wallowing in bitterness and blame never brought me closer to connection. But taking action did. Walking. Running. Getting involved in things. Reaching out. Saying yes. Trying new things. Building things. Helping others. Failing. Learning. Failing again.

I want to say something that might sting—but might also free you: You’re not broken. You’re just stuck. And you don’t have to stay stuck.

You’re not doomed to be alone forever. But you do have to start moving. Not toward someone else—but toward yourself. Toward the version of you that you respect. The version of you who’s emotionally strong, curious, generous, and growing.

Beware the voices that tell you to hate women, or society. That energy might feel powerful—but it keeps you locked in pain. People like Andrew Tate? They aren’t your friend. Even the “positive” stuff he says is tied up in poison, and too many people can’t separate the two.

If you want power—real power—build yourself. Step outside. Get uncomfortable. Try. Fail. Connect. Volunteer. Join something. Lift yourself up, not so you can dominate others, but so you can meet others where they are, as an equal.

You don’t have to be perfect. You just have to begin.

1jj1eva,"I woke up one day recently and realised I felt content. I felt like, although I wasn't there yet, I had grown to the point where I felt enough. Making this write-up about my core experiences, and my progress from start to finish, hoping it might help someone else here.","Weeelll... to be honest, that's just part of it. I doubt more than a handful of people will even read this. Maybe the automod will straight-up filter it out. Some of you will probably feel like this is more empty, self-aggrandising wank written by normies who want to gloat about their success. But maybe someone will recognise themselves in my experiences. And writing swathes of text is just really cathartic. So if this helps even one person, I'm happy. **Tl;dr at the bottom.**

A few things to preface this write-up: I'm not in some glamorous place, living it up with my harem after I miraculously grew ten inches in more ways than one, if that's your idea of success. I'm still broke, struggling and in college, don't like talking to people and by society's account ""a loser"", but none of that matters to me the way it did before. Also, I'm a 25-year old brown guy, so my experiences might not align with all the people on the FA spectrum. Also also, it's up to you to decide if I was ever even FA, since that already is a pretty abstract label. Nonetheless, it's how I felt. Didn't have any severe physical shortcomings, other than being pretty short, but not really any ""attractive"" features either. And I was soul-crushingly lonely

I first realised I was FA when I was 19. After a series of specific experiences, I realised I had no idea who I was, who I wanted to be, how I got here, what goals to outline, how I wanted to achieve them, etc., etc. I had no life skills to speak of, barely made it through high school, little social skills and barely any real life experience. Feelings of aimlessness and lackadaisicality were always there in my subconcious, but were silenced with a little voice, deluding myself into thinking that everything will work out fine in the end. But seeing as all the ones whom I thought were like me were now moving on with their life, onto bigger and better things, I looked at myself in the mirror and thought...

##I am a loser...

I've always joked about it and half-heartedly thought I accepted it... but fully realising it and being forced to swallow that harsh truth felt a lot more bitter than I thought it would. My biggest dream was to find a girlfriend, but who would want someone as incapable and unlovable like me? I don't even have any cool hobbies or interests like most other FA losers, I didn't even listen to music. If there was someone out there somehow deluded enough to give me a chance, is this the version of me they'd fall madly in love with? I don't want to shirk the responsibility of becoming the best version of myself onto someone already doing me a favor by going out with a useless nobody like me. 

There's a lot more to be said about who I was and how I started figuring out how my brain worked, but this write-up is already longer than I expected, so I'll keep the following sections a lot more concise.


###The things that kickstarted my desire to change:

I refused to acknowledge that this was gonna be me for the rest of my life, whether it be because I was motivated to change, or my loser life had given me delusions of grandeur and I subconsciously looked down on people.



Since I didn't know who I was and what I wanted, I looked back on my childhood and tried remembering the things I was passionate about, and why and when I stopped caring. I realised I used to be passionate about many things; things that were deemed ""gay/unmasculine and for nerds"". Extreme pressure forced me to try and conform to expectations of masculinity, but in doing so, it had simultaneously caused me to **literally unlearn how to enjoy myself,** and made me feel like worthless for failing to ""attain"" masculinity.

I had little interest in fashion, but wanting to improve myself, I spent what little money I had on some clothes, and I built up the courage to try them on in my room. I felt so embarrassed. They were regular clothes, but still it almost felt like I was crossdressing - and that made me so mad. Why? Why, when I spent the little money that I have on myself to try on some clothes I thought might be cool, am I sitting here *in my own room*, not allowing myself to feel good about it? That anger broke me, and made me realise something I hope to instill on everyone here: **Unless there might be physical repercussions, try your best to this specific type of discomfort when exploring new ideas. You are denying yourself an infinite amount of amazing possibilities and experiences.** This was how it started for me and I now feel like I have a great fashion sense. It's really become one of my favorite creative outlets.

From that moment on, almost every time I had some kind of reaction to anything, I took a step back to think about why I had the reaction the way I did. It really revealed to me how much I wasted my energy caring about asinine stuff, both in reference to what people thought of me and what I thought of them. I realised I could be unflinchingly mean, because all my subconscious thoughts were telling me that they hated me anyway. The internet was rife with ""cringe-culture"" and I became grossed out by it overnight. ""You know what, why do I care when I could just not? These people seem a lot happier than me, that's for sure.""

###Taking action

>*Recontextualising things for yourself might help you realise that you care too much about stupid stuff, but unlearning that reaction is still extremely tough.*

This is one of the biggest positive changes I've made. The first time you try something, it feels ""cringe"", you start doubting yourself. ""Maybe they were right, this is kinda stupid,"" and you feel defeated. But if you have even the slightest feeling you wanna try again, do it. Things will be different, I promise you. Any inkling of progress helps you better understand what you want and how you want to do it. Though some things you'll still find stupid. I wanted to be more social, and now I try my best to avoid talking to people that aren't my friends. I was lucky to have a lot of free time on my hands around 19 - 21 and almost all hobbies and personality traits I've cultivated were the result of me investing more time and resources into things that piqued my interest, trying my best to muffle the little voice in me that told me I was cringe. Plenty of bad financial decisions were made, though.

I grew out my hair, despite me thinking it would look awful, and it became the biggest reason I had any confidence at all. I got an ADHD diagnosis, which helped me tremendously. For a long time, I would never have wanted to try and find out something like that. I didn't want one more flaw to add to the laundry list of things that made me a failure. But due to silencing that little voice, I allowed myself to see it for the eye-opening diagnosis that it was. I became less worried about ""feeling/looking stupid"", and instead wanted to feel proud about being knowledgeable. It made me more eager to learn about all the little things I didn't know. I used to subconsciously categorise things as ""Stuff I am capable of doing"" and ""Stuff normal people are capable of doing"". But with every little nugget of knowledge I gained, I became more aware as to how stupid that was, too. Instead, I started asking myself ""What are they doing, and what is the distance between me and them?"" I gained an enormous amount of insight because I had accepted that it's okay to not know things. And over time, every time I looked into the mirror, I saw a unique combination of attributes that I felt increasingly happier to recognise as *me*, all because I decided to ignore the what ifs. Unfortunately for me though, taking care of long hair is still a pain in the ass :')

>*If something doesn't work out, you might feel defeated, but you'll eventually forget all about it. If something does work out, it might pay out a life time of dividends. Please don't consider investing in yourself as something ""wasteful"". Do you not think you're worthy of having nicer things?*

I also finally started dating at age 20 and learnt a lot about that, too, but that's such a fustercluck of random unrelated experiences that I cba adding it to the write-up. I already got waaaayyy too invested into this lmao. If you found any of this useful, feel free to ask for whatever in the comments.

**Tl;dr:**

- **I realised my shortcomings and started working on accepting them.**

- **Accepting said shortcomings had the cascading effect of finding out just how well and truly f*cked I was (not sure if the auto-mod would let me swear).**

- **The more I learnt to accept these aspects, the less unpleasant they felt to face, and the easier it became to start changing my behaviour.**

- **Changing my behaviour not only led me to new opportunities, but also allowed me to see those opportunities from a fresh perspective.**

- **Willingly engaging in new things, regardless of how ""cringe"" it felt, or how other people might judge me for it, imbibed me with new knowledge, a lot of which I didn't know I had previously missed out on**

- **New knowledge helped me better curate my interests, allowing me to broaden my horizon while simultaneously tightening my scope onto the things I care about most.**

- **Allowing myself to learn/try more and more things helped me make bigger and better changes, which motivated to continue making change. A clearer version of my identity began to emerge.**

- **These changes, over time, put distance between the version of me that I was leaving behind, and helped me get closer to the better version of myself that I was becoming. I became increasingly happy looking into the mirror and seeing a 'me' I associated with a positive image, rather than one of failure.**",Unlovesick,9,11,Success Story,woke one day recently realised

1jw0k2d,When even your oldest friends start acting like strangers…,"I’m 22 and never had a big friend circle — just three people I actually considered real friends. No drama, no fake connections — just people I thought I could rely on.

Lately, it feels like they’ve all started pulling away.

One of them, who I’ve been distancing myself from, had this way of putting me down — subtly, but consistently. Never anything obvious, but enough to chip away at me over time. I finally started stepping back from that dynamic.

Now, it seems like he’s turned another friend against me. That second friend came back to the city recently after a long time. He didn’t even reach out when he got here, even though he told me weeks ago he’d be visiting. I met him today, and the vibe was totally off — distant, uninterested, like we were just casual acquaintances. He’s been staying at the first guy’s place this whole time, so I can guess what’s being said behind my back.

Then there’s my third friend — someone I’ve known since childhood. He’s living abroad now. I’ve tried calling and texting him a few times over the last six months. No reply, except once when he said he’s too busy to even talk to his parents. But yesterday he made time to chat with that second friend. That part stung.

I’m not someone who gets overly emotional or expects constant attention. But when the only people you actually let close start treating you like you don’t matter, it makes you question whether the friendship meant as much to them as it did to you.

I talked to my mom about it, and she thinks the manipulative one poisoned the well. Maybe. I don’t know. I’m not mad — I’m just tired of chasing people who clearly don’t feel the same way anymore.

Not sure if I’m overthinking, or if this is just how life goes. You grow up, and people you thought were solid start acting like strangers.

I’m so thankful to have a loving family who support me. It really hurts not getting to know what a romantic relationship is like, to go on dates, have sex, make memories.

It annoys me because I don’t understand why someone would match only to ignore me. I hate how the apps constantly have pop ups and try to push features to me. I never subscribed to anything but I can see why the temptation is there. These companies prey on vulnerable and emotional people just to make money.

There’s also shady people on there like scammers, catfishes or people trying to sell content which is not what the apps are for. There are success stories here and there but they are few and far between. What I think is the worst aspect of dating apps is the toxic culture that’s it’s spawned.

1ju67sa,Weeded Out of the Gene Pool,"I came across a video earlier tonight while I was scrolling through Instagram. It showed an alligator snapping turtle hunting fish by using its tongue as bait, opening its mouth wide and wiggling its worm-like appendage in an attempt to lure in a hungry fish. The poor scaly swimmer with the misfortune of becoming that turtle's lunch wasn't necessarily stupid: it took its time to assess the bait, swimming just far enough from the snapping turtle's mouth to get away if it needed to. But hunger got to it eventually, and it swam right into the turtle's reach and got eaten. I don't know how much conscious thought the turtle put into its hunting strategies, but I doubt that it ever considered that it has an appendage on its tongue that looks exactly like a worm. That came from natural selection. 

Natural selection is incredible. At some point a few million years ago, a turtle was born with some weird appendage with no obvious practical benefit. That appendage, so far as anyone knows, was due entirely to luck and chance, but it nevertheless turned out to have a handy purpose. Some poor fishes thought that it was a worm and practical gave themselves away to that turtle as food; that turtle was well fed and lived a long life, giving the world many, many babies. Some of those babies had that same appendage, and they were usually better fed, longer lived, and more sexually successful than their appendage-less counterparts. Then most of their babies had it, and they also outproduced their appendage-less siblings, and so on and so forth until no alligator snapping turtle without it was considered normal and healthy. It's an incredible thing. But no one seems to care about the turtles that didn't survive. 

Lately, I've felt a lot like the turtles that didn't make it through natural selection. My genes are poor for creating someone that makes an appealing partner, and that keeps me from reproducing. Maybe that's a good thing for human civilization; maybe it's best if I don't have any children and pass on my shitty genes. But there's something extremely painful about being the one that doesn't get to do it, about being the one that has to live as the genetic loser. I hate it...hate, hate, hate it.

1jtwjxe,i don't even feel like a woman anymore,"22f. Never been kissed. never went on a date, never got attention from men. Never even held someone's hand. I've been mocked and belittled my whole life. I was one of those scraggly emo kids and that's when the bullying started. Being asked out as a joke, having my bra exposed to be mocked, being called flatty or asking me if i was trans because I was so flat. 

I feel completely miserable and unlovable. It seems everyone assumes that girls will always get a ton of attention and love and can always get a partner no matter what. I know I probably could find a boyfriend if i really wanted to. But he wouldn't actually want to be with me, or would only be with me to be with a young woman, not because he was actually attracted to me. I would be used and then dumped for the next best thing. 

I don't even know what I'd do in a hypothetical relationship. How do I kiss? When are we supposed to have sex? God forbid, how do I even do *that*?? I feel so behind everyone else my age. I don't know how to do things that other girls know how to do. What guy would give me the time of day as some shy, awkward virgin, when he could be with a girl who was a million times hotter, smarter, funnier, more social, and good in bed. 

I'm have so little confidence and self love that I feel like my biggest bully is myself. I have no friends outside of a few online ones. My life is just school, work, and then home. My best friend is my cat. 

What am I going to do? I want to find a way to be happy by myself. I like being alone. But feeling lonely is the worst. I feel like less of a woman and like something must be horribly wrong with me for no one to ever like me. I like women, too, but none of them give me the time of day either.

1jsyy1r,"Virgin 28M, never kissed or had a girlfriend","I just don't understand it. I don't understand it. I wish things had turned out differently. But here I am at 28 years old. I just wish I knew what a kiss felt like. I just want to be able to be intimate with someone. I just want someone to love me. Why is that so hard to find? My dad tells me ""let her come to you, she'll come to you in time."" But he's been saying that for the past decade. That's all he does. He doesn't actually help me meet people. Whenever I explain how I feel to him, he just gets agitated and babbles on about how lonely he feels too, which doesn't make me feel any better. Literally nothing has happened romantically or even like finding a friend who is a woman, in my life at all. No one really seems to care, no one cares.

Nothing is happening and nothing is going to happen. I'm done pretending, I'm done hoping. The only thing I want is the answer why, and I don't know. I have no opportunities to meet people. From some small town in the US. I work from home full-time. Dating apps don't work. I am a Christian and have tried Upward for months. I swipe right on every single profile I see, like 200 swipes a day. I get a few, maybe 2 likes a day when I do this, that are literally all comprised of unattractive or overweight women that I just don't feel attracted to. I'm not bashing them. It's just not my thing. And even when I do message them on the app, which I do even though I don't feel attracted to them - because you might as well try, right? - they never respond. I'm not asking for a movie star - just someone who looks even somewhat decent. What is wrong with me, why are girls repulsed from me? Why do they immediately lose interest in me as soon as they see me? What is it about me? I just don't understand it.

I tried eHarmony, which is a scam and no one replied to me on that platform either. It's like the site is dead. I'm not into hookups, so I don't use Tinder. And I tried ChristianMingle to no avail. I don't know what to do. I don't think there's anything I can do. 

I just want someone who cares about me, will reach out to me and hug me and love me, but it's just too much to ask from a woman to do that. They're just not willing.

I used to have hope, when I was more ignorant about the world, a long time ago. As the years passed and I started getting older, my hope slowly eroded away. Now I realize it's already too late. I'm supposed to be way farther along in life - I have several mental illnesses that set me back a long way - but no one really cares anyway. Everyone is too wrapped up in their own romantic drama and their own lives to care about me. I just don't understand.

The few friends that I used to have mostly just told me that I need to be happy single, marriage is not as glamorous as I think, and compared my situation to people worse off than me. Didn't help much.

My life isn't going anywhere, and my life is consumed by work and depression. I just wish I had a solution.

I don’t think anyone even likes Gacha anymore. After Gacha, I became sort of a **TikTok star**, and while I did make some friends there too, it wasn’t quite like the community I had in 2018–2019. Still, it was something.

2020 was a calmer year. I started talking to my father’s friend, someone I developed deep feelings for. She was my crush. I was honestly in love with her. But she left me around 2021, and that broke something inside me. After her, I still had a few friends from Instagram and TikTok, but it wasn’t the same anymore.

Then 2022 and 2023 happened.  
In 2022, I only had school friends, but that ended quickly when a classmate spread rumors about me about things I supposedly did. That basically killed every connection I had left. In 2023, I tried to stay in touch with a few friends on Instagram, but eventually, they all disappeared. I honestly don’t know how everything just started ending. It’s like I woke up one day and everyone was gone.

2024 and 2025 have been **extremely lonely** for me.  
I’ve tried finding people on Instagram, Facebook, even Bumble, but nothing. TikTok isn’t an option anymore because I’m barely active, and Reddit is just filled with *thirsty guys*. I’ve been feeling this deep, painful loneliness since 2023, and it’s been killing me slowly.

School has never been easy either. No one really wants to be my friend and maybe it’s because of how I look. Right now, in my class (10th grade), there are only 6 students: 3 boys and 2 other girls, plus me. We also have two students from 11th grade who join some classes. They’re friendly with each other, but no one talks to me. I don’t try anymore. I’m scared that if I try and something goes wrong, I’ll end up having to leave school like I had to back in 2021. I just want to survive quietly now. On top of all this, I lost my **maternal grandmother**, who was with me throughout my entire life. Her absence has left a hole I don’t know how to fill.

I don’t understand why even **social media** can’t help me find real friends anymore. I’ve tried so hard.

1js90p3,I feel more discouraged than ever,"So back in a September I met a girl on Reddit and we hit it off extremely well and became close friends talking every single day and on the phone and face timing etc.

Towards the end of December she posts on the friendship forum that she has feelings for her friend (and describes me). I was gonna bring it up but then she starts talking sexually to me, but then when I reciprocate she pulls away and says she isn’t ready for that. So I mention I saw her post and the feelings are mutual. But she says well now I’m not sure.

A while passes and she asks me to be her boyfriend and I’m really excited. She starts calling me hun and cyber sexts with me and I feel really happy. but then all of a sudden she completely cuts it all off. Won’t do anything sexual, stops calling me hun etc. I try to talk to her about it and she assures me nothing is wrong she just has anxiety.

But then in February she breaks up with me saying she has no feelings for me and only thought she did. We talked a while and she said maybe it’s because we hadn’t met in person so I said give me til the end of April and I will come out to see you (I live in WV she lives in Kansas) and she agrees.

Two days…. 2 days! After dumping me, I mention that I’ve met some new online friends who are female and she gets super jealous and stuff. Then she starts acting more flirty and sends me pics of her in her underwear and acts real sexual again.

I ask her to be with me and she says let’s meet first and then we can discuss it and I say okay. Eventually we settle on May 2 because that’s when the amusement park opens. Things seem okay. But then she starts pulling away again and when I bring it up she says she doesn’t have feelings for me. I say, but I was about to pay almost $700 to come see you… she says well I just thought it was as a friend. I just thought we were friends.

1js44yy,"There is something exceptionally wrong with me for sure, and I don't know whether it's to do with looks or personality.","26M, and lately I've come to the realization that there's something fundamentally wrong i've been doing my entire youth for me to end up being FA , with only a one on one friends, who happen to be as socially inept as me.

Feels completely wrong blaming anything like looks , although I assume they play a factor too because when I've been out to a bar/club I've observed how girls flirted with the people I went to, but treated be as I was invisible. Perhaps  looks + weird body language. Idk anymore. Anyway, school, college uni, and even my old workplace I was always the odd one out, who kept to himself and was always excluded from any groups activities. All this because I felt rejected after every attempt to fit in. In fact at uni I made only one friend to whom I still speak to , but he lives far away from me.  Besides him I don't have any other true friends. The rest of my time at uni, I spent rotting in my room playing games,  drawing and completing my coursework. It's not like I didn't try to make friends and socialise, but from all the effort, I just ended up feeling even more depressed and isolated, all because no one returned the effort in getting to know me. In fact, people only focused on my negative traits for instance, ""Why are you so shy"", ""Why do you do this, this, this"" ? . All I was doing is trying to be nice, and engage in a talk, and listen, but still they treated me like something that came out of the sewers.

My hygiene is good, posture too, I am friendly, good listener, and i've been told that I'm a really chill person. Despite that i always give off weirdo vibes without intending to. On the contrary, I am slightly socially awkward, introverted, but still trying my best to engage.

I know I should be putting myself out there more, go to social events and stuff, but from all the social rejection, isolation, I feel so mentally exhausted and depressed that I don't even have the energy to do anything that involves talking to others.

1jrpxg0,Too much could go wrong with dating for me to ever find love.,"When I think of how many factors that go into play with dating being successful in actuality it seems like I am against all the odds. I wouldn't be compatible with anyone due to my sexual orientation most likely.  I'm introverted, autistic and have an avoidant attachment style.There's other things to consider like financial competence, politics, religion, whether to have kids or not have kids, and goals to consider. There so many big things in dating that I dont think anyone is ever going to check off all of my boxes. Too many things could go wrong and when I talk to anyone I just think they are leading me on or playing me anyways. I'm ugly so the difference holds a major contrast to the treatment I get everyday. I try dating apps but can't find anyone I like. There's just so many obstacles that would lead to divorce and I'm afraid of that also along with having an avoidant attachment style. I'll think I'm lonely but then when I talk to guys I start to feel trapped and second guess what I wished for.I start to replay what they said in my head and then think ""Well since they said x y z they must just be a player."" There's too much to be skeptical of especially with all the hookup culture where no one wants anything serious. I think I've become disillusioned by love. It can't be that good and if it is it's too good to be true in some way shape or form by either being toxic, or love not being enough to withstand the practical things a relationship needs or the person is just lovebombing just to butter someone up for their own selfish motives.

A thunderstorm rolls in.  Might as well stay in.  You find protection from the elements and sit outside just listening to and watching the rain.  The distant lightning.  It's too far to hurt you.  In fact in this moment, nothing seems like it could ever hurt you, with her by your side.  You just listen in silence.  It's an easy silence.  A comfortable silence.  It's not a silence that's begging to be broken, one that is caused by and continued by lack of knowing what to say.  It's a peaceful silence.  Your skin is chilled underneath your hoody, but not so much to drive you inside.  An hour passes.  Occasionally the silence is penetrated by fun conversation.  Maybe a chat about the beauty of nature.  You don't know the ugliness of it.  I mean you do, in an abstract sense.  Lions viciously ripping out babies from wombs, bedbugs forcibly inseminating females, all kinds of natural oddities.  But you don't know the *real* ugliness of nature.  The ugliness that condemns people, for whatever the reason, physical or psychological, to loneliness for the entirety of their life.  You don't know first-hand the brutality of human nature, it's selfishness.  Not with her next to you.  With her, whatever troubles the world has had in perpetuity either don't matter in the grand scheme of things, or will be sorted out in time.

Some laughter.  Some teasing.  Some kissing.  That job wore you down all week.  It's worn you down for a lot of weeks.  It wore you down like your childhood did.  Your adolescence.  Early adulthood.

1jpr2bp,Girl i was interested in ended up dating a friend i presented to her once,"Long story short: met a cute girl at work, she's pretty chill and we share some interests, i take up a lot of confidence and ask her to go out and spend an afternoon at the park, we get along well spending time with her feels light and amazing the afternoon was wonderful i never felt at ease like that with someone before, she's up for another hang out. Plan to go out a few more times with her over the course of a month or two so we know each other well and i can make a relationship blossom, going out with her felt soooo good i could spend days talking with her about our passions and views on the world.

I Invited her to a movie i planned to see with another friend of mine, it goes well and she plays into the group dynamic. And then it all goes bad, weeks passes by and i see from my friend's story both of them outside, when i confront him as to why he didn't invite me as well he gives me fake excuses and turns out they did go together a few times without me.

I talked with her at lunch break today and she just said that they were dating and she thanked me for introducing him to me. She said that she liked him a lot and that she liked me too but that it would be awkward to either go out with me while she's dating my bestfriend and that it'd be weird if i was in the middle of their group while hanging out. She said sorry for leaving me out like that and said that we could still speak over the phone or talk at work, she said that i was a ""rare guy to meet with rare qualities and a unique presence"" she said that she understood how well my friend and i are matching our energies (him being a very impulsive and energetic boy while im a calmer but always open to anything man) but she still dates my friend and not me. I know it's not healthy to stay in contact with someone you feel strong emotions with but can't reach, i don't know what to do now, i'll just step back and retreat in silence.

I don't know what to feel anymore now, it's not the first time it goes well with someone before it suddenly falls down. I don't know why im never a priority even if im a rare man with rare qualities. It always happens to others, i've yet to experience this pleasure too. I have to fight everyday just to get what others people have by just living normally. Companionship is a need, i want to have intimacy with a girl, i want to sleep in the same bed as her i, i want to hug and kiss her, i want to protect her, give her gifts, do anything for this hypothetical lady to be happy. I don't know anymore what im missing, im cursing every thing that made me. Im sick of spending days alone not uttering a single word. I workes on myself for years to bypass awkward talks, i attended events, joined clubs, talked with people. I took skincare, worked out, learnt how to style my clothes, learnt to dress myself, i have hobbies, i have an academic background, what do i lack i followed everything right, i always was virtuous and an honest man.

I wish to disappear into fine dust, if i have to live a life of silence i'd rather be a loud memory.

1jpe1ny,I wish society was kinder to perpetually single people,"In pop culture, mainstream media & society in general, singles over 25 or 30 are viewed as more carefree & iimmature than their counterparts. While feminism did a good job reducing the stigma around women who remain single well into their 30s, A guy who hasn't had substantial dating experience is viewed with more suspicion & disdain, whereas a guy who hasn't been loved at all is perceived as the penultimate loser across many societies. Even men's movements ridicule such men. The common denominator of insults for a man across the board is ridiculing his perceived lack of experience in romance or dating.

Contrary to popular stereotypes of men who are inexperienced in dating or serious relationships, most of us are normal people who just weren't lucky in Romance. We aren't some dysfunctional sociopaths or political extremists.

I'm a 31 year old male, had two short flings before, but never had a long term relationships. My close friends know this, but I lie to everyone else about my relationship status, saying either I got off a long term relationship or I'm working on one. Heck, even some paperwork nowadays ask reasons if the box ""never married"" is ticked. I feel like if my secret ever gets out, I'd be ridiculed, considered borderline dysfunctional & even look apprehensive to some.

I don't expect society to tell that we're okay, I guess I won't hear that in my life time. All that I hope is that if people were less judgmental of older adults, especially men, who aren't married or have little to no dating experience. Society tells us that it isn't a race & everyone's experience is unique, but that same society would raise eyebrows if you don't have something going on for you at a certain age.

If you're not a Forever Alone person reading this, please be kinder to people like us. We are not stagnated, we are improving ourselves everyday, most of us are good people. Treat us just like any person else. Before we find love, we'd love to be seen as human first.

1jp8p9o,Interview I had with a popular YouTube creator exposed to me the complexity of making connections,"So I recently had a video call with a YouTube creator about a program he had mentioned and announced people to sign up for. He has the most subscribers on there for his niche at around 210K. I was a little nervous about how the video calls/discussion would go from the beginning and also during. After the video call, he was impressed by how I was able to speak which to me was hard to believe.

This was hard for me to believe because like many of us on here in my decades of living in this doggone Earth, I still don’t have luck with women like I’ve been promised I would have. I can get dates and meet people however rarely any of the dates I’ve gone on they have an interest in wanting to see or talk to me again, and none of it has led to a relationship from me as I end up getting ghosted or turned it down at some point. Also, I hardly have any friends and all those friends really was the result of luck rather than me being an outgoing person, knowing how to talk to people or just being friendly, and having the good traits I’ve been always taught to have. 

This moment was a sure fire reminder that I feel like nearly anyone in general do not like me enough to have a connection or a relationship with me. I don’t feel like I’m a bad conversationalist and other people have told me that I converse in a good way or better than I thought. I also try to be friendly, considerate as much as I can, and make people laugh, and if I’ve tried demonstrating those traits to dozens of women over the past decade and not ONE had enough interest, I really don’t know what to do besides hope that I have some kind of luck.

1jon5ts,I’m so tired.,"Let me know if I’m not in the right sub (and/or where I should go). 

40F and have had crickets on dating apps for 2 years. Last ex cleaned me out financially and I’m about a sneeze away from being homeless now because of that. 

I was told by my parents for YEARS that I didn’t need friends, I didn’t need a spouse, and I didn’t need kids. I’m fine without the kids part (would rather have pets), but I’m right where they wanted me my whole life. Completely alone. I work and come home. I work all the time too, make no money, and have little time for other activities. Any “friends” live too far away or make me initiate everything. I stopped initiating during covid because I was so tired of it. I still am. The ex who drained my savings was also abusive and manipulative, so that didn’t help the situation either, as he attempted to isolate me. 

Fact of the matter is, all 3 of my LTRs were because the guy was lonely or bored. Not because they actually cared about me. I got dumped by 2 of them (and they found their spouses soon after) and had to dump the manipulative one myself because I couldn’t take it anymore. I’m not physically attractive and never have been, and the last three guys I talked to on dating apps didn’t really go anywhere. 

I wish I could figure out what I’m doing wrong. I just seem to be the person no one likes or else used to get ahead. I’m just tired.

1jnm0g7,"""Love and Sex isn't all that"" says the guy who's been in a long-term relationship","I'm sick of hearing this from people who've been in or still in long-term relationships. Just yesterday, in our therapy group, I opened up again about my hopelessness, feeling empty and depressed without love in my life and having never experienced it, when a guy says to me ""trust me it's not that all that...I mean yeah sex is great and all that but trust me it isn't all that..."" And this guy has been with his girl since he was 16, he's now 27. 

I am absolutely sick of it and I'm really considering slapping the next person that says this to me. 

I'll give an analogy. Imagine a group of hungry people starving to death, sitting outside a restaurant, being prevented by police from going in. Eventually they let one guy in, so he enters and eats and eats and eats till he's almost sick, and literally cannot get another morsel into his mouth, and feels sick just looking at the food. He then comes out and tells everyone else, I dunno what you guys are obsessing over, honestly it's not all that, I feel sick looking at the food now...

You get the analogy. 

These people are selfish ignoramuses. 

More than being insensitive, it's completely stupid. Another angle they seem to approach is that because the excitement and romance whittles down after a few months, it somehow renders the initial period of excitement and romance as worthless. That is completely stupidity. No pleasure in this life is perpetual, does that take away from the value of the experience? Why go out to eat at expensive places instead of always eating at home? Why go on holidays instead of just staying at home? Because the experience itself has value, even if it's not temporary.

Now I am at a social/emotional maturity level where I could make friends and socialize a little better… if I was still 18. This level is still behind my age group. Getting close to my late 20’s, literally everybody is now married, having kids or at least in a relationship, and have their own friend groups and friends. They have 0 interest in getting to know me. Nobody initiates at all anymore, it’s always me who has to try and endure ghosting, uninterested one word replies or hostility. It’s like nobody  cares at this age if you haven’t been in their social group/network for ages. I am rejected by society at this point. Can’t even land a job anymore. Dating, jobs, friends it’s all the same.

Although tbh, this issue was already a thing when I went to college, I thought it was gonna be my big comeback moment but everybody was already in pre-formed cliques and groups and surprisingly weren’t open at all to making friends with me since I wasn’t part of their pre-formed network so they ignored me. High school years was the last time when I should have formed social networks. If you have’t done it by your late teens it’s gonna be impossible to catch up and “break into” established groups. Can’t even do it to my remaining friend’s group, let alone to strangers.

1jn04hj,I feel disposable,"Whether I initiate first or the other person initiates something social, 9/10 times I get ghosted or cut off. It doesn’t matter whether it’s friendship or potential relationships, it almost always ends the same way. 

I haven’t made a new irl friend in several years. I’m autistic and I have a flat affect, which makes people think I’m cold and unfriendly. I’m polite, but most people my age automatically dislike me for my lack of facial expressions and flat voice. Old people tend to like me much more. 

When I have forced myself to mask and show emotions, people thought I was being insincere. The IRL friends I made before all gradually drifted from me and now I’m in touch with none of them more than once a year.

Instead, all I have are the handful of people I met on Discord that didn’t ghost me within a few days or months. We text multiple times a week and I like them, but the closest ones live three hours away and purely interacting online doesn’t really satisfy my need to socialize. Sometimes I join “friend making” servers to meet more people, but all of those people ghost super quickly (even the ones that add me first). I’d think it has something to do with me, but I’ve had multiple online friends say I was a nice person and a good texter.

Dating hasn’t been any better. Anyone who has shown interest in me changed their mind because I was either too oblivious until it was too late or I made a social mistake I didn’t notice that made them abruptly change their mind. I joined a few dating apps, but I’m in a somewhat rural area and since I’m nonbinary I went through all of the profiles on both apps available to me in less than a week. I got one like that I wasn’t into and then one match that I ended up having zero chemistry with. I am now 23 and I haven’t even had my first kiss.

I always see people on Reddit suggest the Meetup app for meeting people, but both in the big city I used to live in and the somewhat rural area I live in now the app is basically dead and the few events on there barely have any attendees (and they’re all 30+ years older than me).

The other “solution” I always see made online is to go to third places to potentially meet people, which I already do. Every day for the past year I’ve gone to a coffee shop and then the library to hang out for a while. No one ever strikes up a conversation with me and just looking at people my own age and walking in their general direction makes them say “piss off.” Even out here in the middle of nowhere Oregon, the Seattle Freeze is still in effect.

1jmtspn,Drowning in the mud while others fly free,"Never had a girlfriend. Never had sex. Never kissed. Never even had a female friend. And it’s not just the absence of these things that gets to me, it’s how far behind I feel compared to everyone else. Like I’m some defective version of a human being.

I watch people my age live their lives like it’s the easiest thing in the world. They date, break up, move on, find someone new. Over and over. Meanwhile, I can’t even connect with one person. Not even one. And that fact alone makes me feel like I don’t even deserve to be here.

Imagine, in a few years, I somehow meet someone. Maybe they like me. Maybe they want to be with me. But then I realize they’ve had ten relationships before me. Ten. And I’m at zero. How could I ever compare? They're so far beyond me in life experience, they're a wise put together adult that has lived life while I'm just a naive immature child that stumbles around pathetically. They've had so much experience that they know exactly what they want, while I don't even know how it feels to hold hands. Would I even matter to them? Or would I just be another number? A temporary stop on their way to the next person? To them, relationships are just part of life, something that comes and goes. To me, it’s an impossible dream, something I’ve never even touched.

It makes me feel so small. Like an insect. Like an ant trying to compare itself to a god. They’ve spent years flying through the skies, living, experiencing, feeling. And me? I’m still crawling in the mud, unable to even take off. They’ve crossed oceans, seen the world. I don’t even know what the next puddle looks like.

I’m going to change some things in my life. I’ll get a hair transplant. I’ll try to fix what I can. But if by the end of 2027, my life is still the same, if I’m still stuck here, alone, watching the rest of the world fly while I sink deeper, feeling more inferior and disconnected by the day, I’ll stop fighting it. I’ll embrace it. I’ll go all in. I’ll dive as deep into the mud as I can, because maybe that’s where I belong. I’ll be 100% free. And if that kills me, so be it. At least I’ll have lived *something*. Even if it’s just for a moment.

And one day I will fade,

I’ve been single for 14 years. My last ( and only) relationship was not a good one. He  was ashamed of being seen in public with me and would continuously say it. Always making me walk behind him or sent on the other side of the grocery story to avoid being associated with me. Saying I was good for bringing money in but too ugly and fat. 16 years of it… It left scars. Lots of them. I know now it was abuse. But when you meet someone at 17, have kids with them and they start treating you that way…you start to believe it’s normal. 

I ended up leaving. He said I would never find anyone else. 14 years later I do realize he was right.. I don’t know what real love is. I see it happening for others but not for me. I’m terrified of men. I’ve done the therapy, the meds, the self work…. Lost 100 pounds.. you name it.. 
I can handle being single but what I really miss right now is sleeping next to someone.. you know that safe and peaceful feeling of just being safely in your most vulnerable state? I envy those who have this on the daily… it’s such a small thing for them…

1jmf74c,"And so, I need to get some things of my chest.","*Every day I wake up, then I start to break up...*

  
Just for clarification - I'm writing this after 10 hour night shift in my country, and English is not my first language. 

  
Anyway, I feel empty inside for long time. I'm right now at the end of my studies... Went all without love. And you know what's worst? The thing that I was in love once. 

The story begins before the university. I knew a girl, who cheated on me. That's the important part - and the fact that her new boyfriend had to brag about ""stealing my girlfriend"" on my DMs. 

Went to the university in diffrent city, hoping to find someone. Was there not enough stories about loser who goes to new place and finds his love? Five years later - this is not one of this stories. Because of being desperate, I pushed people away from me. I was acting pathetic and honestly? I would stay away from myself. However, I just want to put emphasis on the fact, that I'm NOT the same guy as five years ago. I'm not acting all ""I'm so sad, so miserable"" (and yes, I know the fact that this post goes against this). 

I think the worst part is that I know that it's not them, not ""being misunderstood"". The blame is on me, the burden is mine to bear - that it was me, who pushed away any chances. And who lost. 

But well, I didn't give up. Had to survive, being a coward. Yes, a coward, because It's not hope, it's fear that kept me still. Fear of death, of making the last straw... Call it however you want. Mind that it was pandemic, and I was literally locked up. 

So I started looking for people. After all, that's the advice everyone will give you, right? Dating apps are biased (and with my face being the 100% working anticonecption, I had no hope. i tried them, so it's not just ""it would end that way!""), so the best is to have a hobby and go there, to find someone who will love you, and the pasion will join you two!

Yeah, sure. Here's a list:

\- I playe TTRPGs. Joined a server four years ago, with our community recruited in a way ""I know a guy who wants to play"". Guess who's still alone. 

\- I play video games. I'm on a server from one game I really like. Guess what. 

\- I joined a students organisation focused on integration - basiclly we meet for once for roughly two weeks and drink alcohol, sing shanties... Not a parties, mind you. More like ""a group of colleagues goes out"" is best description. 

\- I like to read books. So started a small book club. 

And I want to tell you one important thing, why fate decided that I'm gonna stay forever alone. 

When there's a girl in one of the higher groups... She has someone. A boyfriend, a fiance, a husband. Of course, not every girl. 

Of course it's not every case. There are girls who are single. They are lesbian.

That's the 100% girls who I meet in these spaces. And ending my studies, I feel like my options are ending. Yes, there is work... 

But being a night creature I am, I will be looking for Night Shift. That usually are single employee.

And now, what's the most burdening thing? I'm still a virgin. Yes, I know, sex is not that awesome, it will be bad, because every first time is bad, it's not the most definig thing in your life...

They're just telling a hungry man that food is not important and it will taste bad. A metaphor for me, but can you really tell in our culture ""you should not want to have sex once""? And yes, I know about sex workers. It's just... It doesn't feel the same in my mind. I put the diffrence between sex with someone who loves you and paying someone for sex.  

And I'm afraid. Because I don't want to become a wizard. 

Among my friends I am know as the ""clown"", ""the jester"", ""the meme professor"". And yes, I tell jokes about being a wizard, about the right hand. And yes, they laugh with me. 

But then comes a nights like this one - where I feel like a nobody. Like I could disappear and they wouldn't even notice. The family and pressure do not help, but this is not this kind of sub. It's just that I feel like the funny kid when I come back to my home, or sit in work when nothing happens. And start thinking, how my bed will stay cold. How I can't even hug anybody with romantic feelings.  How I am alone in all of this. How even if there is a girl, I lose headstart. Because I have some kind of honor - I'm not going after taken girls. 

And worst? How I tasted this. How I know what it feels to be loved. How it feels to be important to someone and knowing someone is important to you. How it feels to kiss. 

I miss this feelings. 

A question that will forever remains - is it better to stay in the unknown, never knowing how it is being loved? Or is it better to taste this, and then never more?

To end this in a bit positive note, I will quote a comment I once read on youtube under doomer mix. Yes, I listened to them. Yes, I was going on nightwalks. Yes, I was... And I still am a doomer. And yes, the comment is cheesy and stupid... But I like it.

Anyways, we studied together for a while, which was honestly nice and at some point we kinda faded away lol. 

2. This year I met a woman at work place. Kind of happened ""accidentally"". Felt like we are getting along well. Again, despite me telling myself years ago to not get my hopes up I still did. Today I finally reached to the conclusion that there is truly nothing going on between us.

In conclusion. It is crazy to me how a nice gesture from a woman I find attractive can immediately shoot my hopes up, no matter how much I tell myself that I am not husband material. No matter how often I tell myself that she is just being friendly or nice. 

Why does this happen? 

On the other hand, I see that hope is truly an amazing and strong thing. It is truly strong. If I could only focus my hope in the right areas of my life. Maybe I would have been already successful or smth. 

Am still stuck in the *wanting to marry* phase no matter what I do. At least I did realize that I use p0rn to rather drown these feelings instead of actually dealing with them. Time heals. I just have to *suffer* through these emotions. It'll get better. Still annoying to deal with these emotions. You just crave a relationship so effin much. It is crazy. Eghhhh.

So since you can't, but you don't have women in your life outside work you rely on tinder or another dating app which is still bad.

It's a fucking nightmare. Especially in the country where i am from where people date people who they met in school or uni, not classmates but people they met in Uni maybe during parties etc.

I feel i am getting punished for not having had a girlfriend in Uni.

As an adult it's difficult to meet women. I hate that but that's how it is.

In the past the main reason i never got laid is that i was shy of being 20, at Uni and a virgin.

Now look where this fear got me. Late 20's and still a virgin is worse.

Now i almost fall in love with every women that are good looking at work.

I go out with colleagues maybe, have fun with this female coworkers but they don't see me as a potential partner also because they have more opportunities as me so they are not so desperate that they are willing to date a coworker.

1jkhgca,I’ve never been loved,"TRIGGER WARNING FOR ASSAULT AND S*CIDE THEMES, ALONG WITH SELF HARM


I genuinely can't do this anymore. Realising i've never been loved in my life hurts a lot. My parents never loved me and pretty much beat me my whole life. The only good moments i remember were from before 5. I just kind of miss being a kid no one hated, loved unconditionally and hugged. 

Once I started elementary school, teachers didn't like me and did the most to move me away from my friends. At 7, I got an actual knife pulled on me. I got sex*ally assaulted. I forgive who assaulted me because they didn't physically hurt me. But at the same time, what the f*ck. In that same year, I also almost drowned 2 times and no one did anything. Not even asking me if i was fine. 

I started attempting s*cide from 8 years old various times. Once again, no one cared. My friends never ever expressed they love me, they insulted me and after like 7 years of friendship they ghosted me. At 11, I started cutting and had depression, no one cared. I told the psychologist and she gave me the fluoride stare. Which is why i never understood how people didn't wanna confess they wanted to d*e at the psychologist, I literally posted everyday i was about to kms on the whatsapp or instagram story and no one cared. Even when i tried hanging myself and had scars no one cared. 

I once self harmed super badly because of a mental breakdown and all my parents said was ""don't do that or people will think we beat you"". Not even are you ok. I had psychosis, no one cared.

Everyone I've ever wanted has rejected me or ghosted me. And i'm not even ugly, and i obviously don't tell my mental problems to people, when you're this f*cking insane and unloved you learn early how to be normal. 

I've never really had anyone i could talk to and even if i spoke to them all they said was oof. I started antidepressants at 19 secretly bc my mom is against medicine and they didn't even work no matter how we increased the doses i still had meltdowns. I have the emotional capacity of a 3 year old at 20. I am constantly screaming, trying to not hurt myself or break things bc frankly i cant do this anymore. 

On reddit, even when i express who my fav characters are on bitch ass cartoons subreddits i get death threats. I express my fav songs on singer subreddits: death threats. I say all my opinions get downvoted and i get called stupid and insulted to hell for saying the truth. 

I am a virgin, never had a bf, never ha d afriend group, job or anything. Trying to not k*** myself is really hard, knowing i'm unloved and i never will be loved. Great stuff.

1jjro2e,I think going to single sex ruined me socially,"So at the age of 10 I moved countries and since then have only gone to single sex. So… no real chance to interact with women my age. At uni I was to socially awkward/anxious given how it was such a big change to school and so I didn’t really make any friends let alone friends of the opposite gender. 

The few times I tried to make friends nothing really stuck.

Now I’m in my mid 20’s and it’s all dawned on me that I’ve never really experienced anything whereas literally everyone else my age including my friends from school someway somehow have been able to let alone literal 15/16 year olds and it really pisses me off.

Even if by some miracle it does happen I’ll never be someone’s first and my lack of experience means I’ll likely fuck up several things. I hate how it feels like I’ve missed out on so much and now there’s no way to change it and I’m becoming bitter and resentful.

Here I am trying/struggling to get by with work/responsibilities whilst care free teens are having sex/fun and all these other things I never got to do and there’s no guarantee I ever will. I genuinely have no idea how to get over this.

I have a younger sibling who had sex pretty much as soon as they turned 16 (which was my dream/ what I thought was ideal) and has several friends of the opposite gender and I hate/resent how easily it’s all happened for them and not me. And whilst they’ll never say it I bet they’ve quite pleased/ think it’s quite cool that it’s all happened for them and not me yet.

Anytime sex is mentioned in something I watch/read I instantly feel triggered. It feels like a constant reminder that everyone I know my age if not younger has had sex/ experienced a popular relationship or at the very least friends with people of the opposite gender and even that is foreign to me.

1jjn0zk,"I don't know if it's the spring or what, but I've been doing a lot worse lately. Anyone else?","I thought I had gotten past all this stuff, because I was dealing with it so well. Like nothing was able to trigger the shitty feelings. Nothing. Now lately that hasn't been the case. I've been getting the same old feelings which mostly just consist of misery and hopelessness. An emotional hell for me at least.

  
No idea why this is happening. I guess I probably just have to try to get back into the logical side of things. Just acceptance. The facts are that I'm socially fucked up because of my childhood, I'm 24 years old, still live with my parents and all I got is a high school graduation certificate. I was fucked from the very beginning and that's fine since life ain't fair. We can't all have normal parents who instead of traumatizing and fucking your head up, support you and want you to thrive.

I’ve kinda told him in many of those years that I wouldn’t consider doing so for various reasons.

I mean, he’s been a good friend to me the last several years, which is very rare for me to have especially people like us who may not have friends.

1jpg8tl,Can't stop thinking about someone I barely knew from years ago,"Just wanted to get this off my chest.

I randomly stumbled across a distant relative's social media profile I barely knew who I only spoke to once years ago. It triggered a memory I had of her, and now I cannot get her out of my head. I feel this intense desire to reach out to her, but I am worried this obsession is unhealthy and it would be better for me to forget about this.

She has a tragic backstory. When she was just a baby, she went through cancer and survived. Despite not really knowing her growing up, we had a sort of connection where we went to preschool together as young children (I have no memory of her back then). We are both the same age and related as second cousins with the same last name. My mom told me about her and that's the only reason I knew about her.

Then my high school graduation came. I did high school through a private teacher who took in kids who struggled in public school. I was a fairly high achiever for that class so I ended up going to college as part of a state program to do alongside high school when I was 16 and instead of showing up there, I was given course work to do on my own time. She ended up joining that same class for senior year and it wasn't until my graduation that we crossed paths.

She approached me directly before the grad ceremony, acknowledging my name like she already knew me and asked how I was doing and we talked for a bit, indicating her mom probably briefed her on who I was as well.

I did not expect this and was initially caught off guard, but I quickly put the pieces together since I was told she would be there and carried on talking with her like we already knew each other. I'm not gonna shy away from stating that she is a beautiful young woman who was kind and seemed genuinely interested in what I had to say in a way almost none of my other closer relatives ever did.

I am now 25, I have no friends, have never had a relationship, and I'm frequently lonely. I have had my share of parasocial attachments, but this one scares me. I am worried I hold these deepseated feelings for her and that is why I constantly think about her, and that's just messed up. I feel like there is something deeply wrong with me. I feel like I would be disappointed if she had a boyfriend (which is likely at this point), and how tf could that matter to me unless I had those underlying feelings caught up beneath this? Maybe that would get in the way of us connecting because she would have other priorities, but that's something that should make me happy for her.

I think it's probably best I just move on and forget about her, but god, it feels so great imagining me and her catching up on life again even if it's just another 5 minutes.",Ok_Frosting6547,0,2,Advice Wanted,cant stop thinking someone barely knew year ago wanted get chest randomly stumbled across distant relative social medium profile barely knew spoke year ago triggered memory get head feel intense desire reach worried obsession unhealthy would better forget tragic backstory baby went cancer survived despite really knowing growing sort connection went preschool together young child memory back age related second cousin last name mom told thats reason knew high school graduation came high school private teacher took kid struggled public school fairly high achiever class ended going college part state program alongside high school instead showing given course work time ended joining class senior year wasnt graduation crossed path approached directly grad ceremony acknowledging name like already knew asked talked bit indicating mom probably briefed well expect initially caught guard quickly put piece together since told would carried talking like already knew im gon na shy away stating beautiful young woman kind seemed genuinely interested say way almost none closer relative ever friend never relationship im frequently lonely share parasocial attachment one scare worried hold deepseated feeling constantly think thats messed feel like something deeply wrong feel like would disappointed boyfriend likely point tf could matter unless underlying feeling caught beneath maybe would get way u connecting would priority thats something make happy think probably best move forget god feel great imagining catching life even another minute,0.09016666666666664,0.4642083333333333
1jpared,I’m spiraling and don’t know what to do,"
(Sorry for the messy English, it's not my 1st language)

About 8-9 months ago, I (19M) walked in on my then GF in bed with another guy. Needless to say, this one event (and the ensuing messy breakup) did a number on my mental health and it took me a very long time to get back to where I was. I went on a healing journey, picked up some hobbies, stayed consistent at the gym, and I tried to expand my horizons a little bit. All to make me a better person and with the goal of becoming more desirable. Don't get me wrong, I'm proud of my progress, but I was perfectly happy with the person I was before the breakup (Gym 5x a week, fluent in 3 languages, decent personality, etc.), so my main motivator behind further self improvement was finding a life partner.

Now recently, I felt ready enough to start dating again. The apps were a complete disaster. Less than 10 matches total over 2 months (I tended to swipe right on 50% of profiles), with most either never responding or being bots/scammers. I did also go out and meet people, both through my hobbies (Rugby, book club, volunteering mainly), and at bars and clubs (usually went out with my friends on Fridays). I've always struggled to talk to women (really bad social anxiety and ADHD), so I never got anywhere at clubs and bars. I was able to give good impressions but I could never keep someone's attention before they got bored or moved on to the next guy. I had a bit more luck at the food bank I volunteer at and met this wonderful girl there.

We hit it off really quickly. Turns out we share a lot of the same interests (she was also a big reader and had been interested in rugby), and she even had the same tastes as I did with both TV and books. It all really seemed too good to be true, but when we get comfortable with each other I asked her out for coffee. Things went really well, and we committed to a 2nd date. The 2nd date also went well and we started dating regularly. We really clicked and started dating regularly. I made sure to be myself, which she seemed to enjoy, and I didn't bring up anything too sexual unless the conversation prompted it. I felt like I may have finally found that happiness I was chasing with my ex, so I made plans to ask her to be exclusive on our 6th date. We made plans, and I paid for a reservation at a pretty nice restaurant. I also set up a small surprise at an overlook nearby where I'd pop the question.

I never got that far.

On the day, I texted her in the morning to make sure we were still on, and we updated each other throughout the day. Originally the plan was for me to pick her up and drive us, but she told me something came up and she'd meet me there. I guess this was the first red flag. I got to the restaurant, and I waited. I tried texting and calling, but 0 response. I waited until the restaurant called and told me they couldn't hold our reservation anymore, so I cancelled it, went home, and just cried for a very long time. I've been rejected, ghosted, and even stood up since I had started dating again but it never felt like actual betrayal before.

This was all 3 days ago and I don't think I've ever felt this lonely. At this point I've lost my motivation and only get out of bed to attend classes and get my homework done. I feel like some kind of freak, undeserving of love. I push everyone away, I did it with my ex, and now I've done it with this girl and I don't even know what I did wrong. She seemed fine earlier in the day but just dissappears later. We've met and hung out so many times. I just feel disgusted by myself. I thought I could handle failure but at this point it feels like a pattern with me as the common denominator. I feel pathetic getting this hung up over someone I wasn't even in a relationship with, and all the repressed memories from my past breakup have come rushing back.

I've started to resent dating, but there's nothing I'd hate more than to become that one guy who sits in front of his computer all day and blames women for all his misfortunes. I want to be better. I work on myself constantly in order to be someone I can take pride in, I work out 5 times a week and I'm proud of my current state. But whats the point of living this life if I've got no one to share it with? All my close friends rave about how awesome their partners are, and how great they feel as a couple, while all I could do was grin and bear it with the hopes that I would also find someone I could share that joy with, but not anymore. I'm so close to giving up and I just can't see the point of going thru all this effort when it results in nothing.

Sorry for the vent, but I'm just so frustrated, it seems that no matter what you do, something happens. Either someone funnier/better looking comes along, or they realize they're not ready for a relationship, or they find out I'm just plain ugly.

I’m trying to figure out how to build real, genuine friendships—especially with other LGBTQ+ people, but really just people I can connect with and be myself around.

I’m autistic, have ADHD, anxiety, depression, and a hearing impairment. So yeah, socializing comes with some extra challenges. Group settings are confusing and exhausting, and I often feel like I’m missing out on the unspoken rules of how to connect with others.

I’m not looking for party scenes or hookup culture. I just want to know how people make day-to-day friends as an adult—like, how do you go from small talk to actually being in each other’s lives?

If you’ve been in a similar place, how did you meet people who *get you*?  
Where do those friendships start for you?  
And how do you maintain them when things like mental health and sensory issues make socializing a limited resource?
