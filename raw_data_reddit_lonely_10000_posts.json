        "text": "I am in an unhappy marriage. It's a weird yoyo act. Spent nearly 8 of the 9 years feeling absolutely lonely, begging for affection and attention. Constantly being the one trying to figure out how to make us work. With him putting in little effort, or effort until he believes it's enough to shut me up then back to neglecting me. I will admit though he love bombs me like crazy when he slips up with his drinking habit. Usually I would eat that up. But at the end of last year something snapped in me, I told him I would no longer beg for love or attention. That I would just let things play out. Well he slipped up with drinking again. This time in front of my kid. It was alcohol poisoning bad. It was pretty traumatic both for me and my kid. Following day here comes the love bombing. But I felt so disgusted and put off by him after. He got a bit aggressive when the love bombing wasn't working. I got super depressed and fell back to my old eating disorder and lost the energy to do what I usually do for my mental health. So I finally voiced that I didn't see us working out after the kids are all above 18. That really pissed him off. A lot was said but what really struck a cord with me was that he accused me of being a selfish, bad mom because I wanted to be happy. My mind spiraled. I felt kinda angry at that accusation. Especially coming from a man who has been willing to drink and drive, or drink to the point of alcohol poisoning. But maybe he's right, maybe I am being selfish for wanting to be happy. Maybe I was selfish when I wanted us to be happy together and not feel so alone in this relationship. He convinced me that I'm supposed to feel this alone. I'm so unhappy. But I'm behaving now. I'm allowing him to love bomb me, putting effort in giving him attention. It makes the house run smoother, it doesn't disrupt things for the kids. I just needed to vent to get through the day.",

(crazy story ngl)\n\ni dont know what yall think im tryna get frm posting this, and i dont rly care anyways. im js tryna vent here cuz i feel like i dont have any real ppl to vent to. sure, it does feel like everythings changed, and im making all these \u201cfriends\u201d everywhere i go, but i feel like its all kinda fake. that its all superficial and shit, that theyre there for my money or other shit. its no different from way back then, except then i was scared of other ppl cuz i thought they were judging me for my appearance. im writing this cuz i feel deeply dissatisfied with my life, like i went down the wrong turn. my life feels so degenerate and empty now, and i lowk feel pointless as fuck. everyday, im waking up at 2pm, going to the gym, trading abit thru the day then going to a party late once or twice a week and trying my luck. its kinda crazy how much my life changed, but im feeling the same dissatisfaction and loneliness i felt all those years back. can any of yall relate here??\nive never related with anyone on this issue.\n\nalso irl im very very different, i usually try to portray a way more confident, almost narcissistic version of myself, so much so that i feel like its kinda taking over me. ive always been that shy kid at the side who always looked up to confident ppl, so i tried to fake it till i cld make it and it lowk worked out for me. im posting this online on a burner acc cuz idw anyone ik irl to know i posted this.\nand no, none of this is fake. honestly, my transformation feels kinda surprising sometimes, and i cant believe that im the same person as the guy i was 2 years ago. dm for proof/progress pics??\n\nedit to change age, i js turned 18, am NOT 17.\n ",

        "text": "This is my first time posting something like this so forgive me if it\u2019s too long. For a long time, I\u2019ve been wanting to be in a relationship and having more friends and I feel that it\u2019s been nearly impossible. Here\u2019s how it usually goes: Find someone that\u2019s interested in me, conversation continues, I meet up with them several times, things keep going for a while and they decide after several months of talking and hanging out they aren\u2019t interested anymore, and only wants to be friends (usually conversation dies shortly after). Or I start talking and they ghost me after a few weeks, or I meet up with someone for dinner a couple times and I get ghosted.\n\nI'm a 28y/o, overweight male that has a hard time connecting with people and deals with depression, anxiety and is chronically lonely. I don't have many friends or family and when I find someone that interests me, I get excited and hopeful. However, when stuff like this occurs (which is often), I tend to crawl back into my shell and experience body image issues, and become self-conscious. It doesn\u2019t help that I\u2019m a part of the LGBT community and they have issues of their own such as ostracizing those who are not skinny and fit.\n\nThe loneliness is crippling at times and goes hand in hand with everything else mentioned above. I\u2019m at a complete loss and feel totally alone in this. I have a best friend that I\u2019ve tried communicating with on this and he isn\u2019t good in dealing with situations like this and usually has listens and says \u201cI don\u2019t know what to tell you, I\u2019m sorry\u201d. I\u2019ve spent a lot of time crying over the pain of being lonely and feeling like I have nobody to speak to or understand me. It\u2019s extremely depressing. The pain in all of this is overwhelming at times and especially with the current political climate, it\u2019s also horrifying since I\u2019m not sure where things are going to go from here. \n\nAny input on this would be greatly appreciated. Even if you\u2019ve only read this far, I appreciate you taking the time to listen to my concerns. Thank you. ",

        "text": "Just making this post because I wanted to get this off my chest.\n\nLike a lot of people here, I (23M) have never been in a relationship and don't have many close friends. I'm still able to enjoy my life, so honestly, it doesn't really bother me. That is, until people do one thing that really pisses me off.   \n  \nSo many people will trivialize dating and making friends and act as if it's as simple as making your bed. Uber drivers, random people, my parents, etc. will ask me how dating is going. I'm not gonna lie, so I always say I'm not dating. And people will always ask me \"why\" the same way they'd ask me why I didn't brush my teeth or some other mundane task, and it gets on my nerves. I'm not dating because I have nobody to date. Nobody wants to date me. If someone did, then I wouldn't be in this situation. Unlike these people (specifically my parents) make it out to be, finding people to date isn't as simple as buying bread at the grocery store. If it was, then dating apps wouldn't exist. My dad does the same thing with making friends. I remember one day he was telling me about this study he read that talked about how having friends and good relationships with people is one of the most important things for longevity and health and what not, so he told me I should have more friends and relationships with other people. That made me so mad. Like realistically, how do you just go out and have more friends? Like a doctor can just write me a prescription to have more friends. When people say things like this it just makes me feel alienated for being lonely. I don't know if anybody else feels this way",

It\u2019s not like I\u2019m going to die soon or anything (I hope)\n\n\n\nI have written this in my mind several dozen times, still don\u2019t know how to.\u00a0\n\n\n\nFirst of all, English is not my first language and I can not write well at all. Secondly, I do not think anybody owes me anything, this is all on myself. And lastly this is not me throwing a pity party for myself, I don\u2019t know what I think the outcome of this post is more than just screaming into the void of the internett.\n\n\n\nI (m43) have always been alone, and it seems like that is how it will always be. I have always been big, even when I started school I was bigger than my classmates. And not by a little I was all through my school years a head taller and on the heavy side. When I was 16 I was taller than most of my teachers (even the male ones) and much heavier than them too, a side effect was I was also stronger than them. This often lead to problems as I unfortunately had bit of a temper, so when the regular snide remarks came and I snapped, and managed to get a hold of one of them thing didn't end well ( didn't really hurt them to bad, mostly a slap, but due to my size it would be like being slapped by a grown man).\n\n\n\nOne thing that has been on my mind of late is this one girl in my class that I had a crush on. She was one of the few nice ones that never said anything about my weight or size. I often wanted to tell her what I felt, but due to both me being a coward and never having the guts to, and worse the thought of what could happen made me never do so. What I feared could happen was she could just laugh in my face and mock me like the rest (unlikely) or she could just reject me ( most likely) both devastating. But worst she could have said YES, and then she would be targeted just like me, and I could not let that happen. So I said nothing. Autumn last year I heard from her mother that the girl I liked told her that I was the one that she always could trust and lean on when things were hard. I must say I was floored. I never knew she felt this way. Now I\u2019m sitting thinking what might have been. (I\u2019m not saying that we would still be together or anything like that, but just maybe something would have been different later on.)\n\n\n\nWhen I was about to begin at high school I left the small village and moved to the nearest city under the guise that I would have to move for my last year anyway ( was the only place to study Graphic Design). I left so that I could start fresh, and I did. No more bullying, no more snide remarks and I lost some weight. Even had the courage to try and talk (flirt) with a girl at the library. Everything went well until some of my classmates that were there, walked passed and just said something half-jokingly, I instantly knew they didn\u2019t mean anything with it, but I just had to leave all flustered. After that I never managed to build up the courage.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAfter high school I continued to study at a different bigger city (still graphic design), but my dating life was dead. Even moved to a different country to get a bachelor's degree, but still I couldn't muster the courage to even try to date. When I moved back home the recession of 08 happened and I couldn't find work in my feld. I stayed at home, a small farm, homestead.\n\n\n\nDid some freelance for some years, mostly looking after my grandparents who also lived at the farm. My grandfather was diagnosed with cancer and my grandmother had early stage dementia. In 2012 My grandfather died and my grandmother had a stroke and ended up in a home. I was kind of lost for a year, but managed to get a part time job at a local hardware store. After some time I was offered a full time job and accepted. So now I still work at this hardware store during the day and sit by the computer at night and play games with some friends online. No love life of course.\n\n\n\nIn 2016 I got seriously sick, pancreatitis, and spent half a year in hospital. (so glad I don\u2019t live in the U.S I would have been broke) After this I lost a lot of weight I mean a lot. About 60kg. (I was 160kg when I got sick, probably the reason I got sick in the first place) After I got better I gained some weight back, nothing like before but some. Side note I\u2019m also quite tall, 195 cm. Some years later in 2022 I suddenly started to lose a lot of weight . After some time I went to the doctor and found out that I had gotten diabetes, a side effect from the pancreatitis I previously had. Due to this I actually hit me Ideal weight for the first time. I\u2019m smaller now than when I was 16 haha.\u00a0\n\n\n\nLast year I had skin removal operation, and now I look like a normal person for the first time. Here are some of the issues I had lately. I DID NOT think that women would throw themselves at me because of this, that would be stupid to think. No, the problem is I DON\u2019T feel different. I\u2019m still terrified of well\u2026 I don\u2019t know talking to women in that way, opening myself up to that pandora's box of old pain I guess.\n\n\n\nI don\u2019t think anybody has any interest in this but it\u2019s more for myself, just to vent only if it\u2019s into the great vast void of the internett.\n\n\n\nI don\u2019t see any way this will ever change, I am just alone\u2026 ",

He says I\u2019m not the \u201cfun\u201d woman he married anymore that I don\u2019t have time for him etc.    honestly I\u2019m sooo lonely but I focus on the fact I had a high risk pregnancy \ud83e\udd30 which required many doctor visits a month then our child has been sick.  With something every week since he was born.  I have spent so much time in hospital with him.  On top of trying to work and pay for our bills.  Because he keeps Quitting g jobs when he gets mad.   Then since the delivery of our child my hip has been injured and I had to do physical therapy. It has been painful everyday this past week I finally had a surgery to get it repaired.    And he was nasty to me all weekend about having to do house work.    He quit yet another job on Monday and then I accidentally found another woman texting him nsfw stuff and had a meltdown while the plumbers and. My grand mother was at our house when I asked him why his simple answer was he is lonely \u2026\u2026 I feel like an idiot.  Cuz I love my husband but he is the only adult I talk to and he doesn\u2019t seem to value our relationship \u2026.. so if anyone wants to be my friend \u2026",

        "text": "So I am a woman in my mid 30\u2019s. Growing up I wasn\u2019t the cutest girl. I got made fun of and bullied a lot while in school. My first year out of high school I started to have a glow up. I started getting the attention of men and stopped being made fun of. As time went on I kept glowing up more.  At a high school reunion people would say, wow you have changed, you look good, and so on. I was the popular girl at the event. It felt nice at the time. However as time went on and goes on being pretty is awfully lonely. I am only valued for my looks. I work retail and everyday I get people who stop me to tell me I am beautiful. Creepy men trying to hook up with me or their eyes following me too long. It\u2019s got to the point where those looks make me feel gross. Like I am just a normal human trying to live my life. I have become antisocial. People only want to talk to me because of the way I look. I end up getting used and abused because I am only seen worthy because of how I look. There is way more to me than just a pretty face. I want to be cared for and valued for the person I am. I am a good person. Not like one of those people who say they are a good person, I really am. I have changed my hair color and relaxed the way I dress in hopes I can just \u201cblend in\u201d. My boyfriend is a good man, but almost all the compliments he gives me is, \u201cI am beautiful.\u201d I want to be seen more than that. I am more than that. When I was a teen I wanted to be pretty so badly. I wanted to feel loved. I don\u2019t have parents, siblings, or any other kind of family. My circle is very very small because I am tired of being used. Now I see beauty is just as lonely in a different way. Other pretty girl, what have you done to deal with this? Has anything helped? Thank you for listening to my rant. Oh and the point of this is to get legitimate help. I am not full or myself or think I am better in anyway.",

I have social anxiety, whether online or in real life. I can't handle conversations or keep them flowing at all. I would say I am an introvert, but an introvert is just someone who prefers to be alone. But I, I am so lonely. I wish somebody could love me, hug me, and tell me I mean something to them. But nothing. I am nothing.\n\nI made a new friend today, but then he ignored me and talked to others after finding someone who shared similar interests with him. I'm kinda tired of this happening. It always happens. Everybody leaves me, and I feel like I will never be anybody's favorite, never be anybody at all. I\u2019m just there, I think.\n\nI've searched the internet a lot. \"Be confident, be confident,\" blah blah blah. Oh, how I wish it were that easy. The moment I feel confident, my confidence shatters the second I try to socialize. I might put myself in a social place or join those games on Roblox, but I always find myself standing in the corner, too scared to engage in any conversation. Too scared to take the risk. Too scared to be somebody in the room. Or when I hang out in a more crowded place, I feel overwhelmed. by the people, by the noise, by everything.. and I find a way to excuse myself.\n\nI love having friends, I swear, but fate doesn\u2019t think so. Maybe I am better off alone. I feel so lonely.\n\nI wish it were easy.",

The type of love that you could feel when you\u2019re sitting next to the person in silence or slow dancing to soft music playing in the background. It\u2019s like a craving. A craving of sweet and savory. Kinda like chocolate but instead of the curing senses in your stomach, it would be in your brain. I\u2019m overcomplicating it but I\u2019m not really good at explaining this feeling. \n\nBut it hurts knowing that your person who was there for you, won\u2019t be there to settle these cravings.

I can't find a normal subreddit for venting like that. I want someone to understand me, to understand my pain, to tell me that everything will be fine! I just suffer, suffer, suffer... I feel so lost and nobody will help me... I have social anxiety and nobody will talk to me... Everyone around me is too aggressive to be gentle with my vulnerable self.\n\nI wish I could spend more time with her. Even if it's through text. Or I wish I could have friends. At least our love is strong even though we're separated by 4000 kilometers.\n\nI just don't want to be useless. I want to be like those Minecraft YouTubers from 2010's. Happy, funny, laughing at their own jokes... I hope someone will see this stupid useless garbage post this time... Maybe I am just ungrateful that I don't get enough love and my gf is trying her best? I love her so much, but it's so cold, dark and lonely when she's not around...",

I miss the companionship in delinquency, nothing insanely crazy. These were friend groups that were involved with each other daily, Highschool like cliques. Hanging out at each others jobs. Front door always open. Late nights in each others living rooms. Afterwork seeing each other with unspoken consistency. Wasn\u2019t a question of if we\u2019d hangout that day, but when.

For context, I live two states away from my entire family because of school, and my friends from back home are across the country pursuing their own careers. Even then, the number of friends I\u2019ve kept since high school has dwindled down to just my two best friends.\n\nBasically, this fact that I don\u2019t really have anyone in my day to day life, anyone that I can have a genuine talk with about interests outside of studies, has led me to question what I\u2019m even doing with my life. I signed onto a remote research project last summer, but with no one to support me I\u2019ve lost motivation and haven\u2019t worked on it much over the past few months.\n\nWhat makes this all the worse is that I know it\u2019s my fault for not putting myself out there more. I can\u2019t expect the people around me to save me from my own social ineptitude. Regardless, I struggle sometimes to even say \u201chello\u201d to my classmates. If I could, I would see a therapist about this, but since I don\u2019t have much money and don\u2019t have a car out here, that\u2019s off the table for now.\n\nTo summarize, I guess, I have no friends I can talk to regularly and it\u2019s affecting my motivation in my studies and my mentality about my path in life. I don\u2019t really know why I\u2019m writing all of this, to be honest, and I understand it\u2019s not a world ending problem I\u2019m dealing with. I just needed to put my thoughts into words I suppose in the hopes that someone might hear",

I suppose my point is, I have so many people in my life, but I have no one I can go to. \n\nI\u2019m sitting here alone in a parking lot crying cause I have so many emotions right now and need someone to talk to and to just vent but I have no one\u2026I have no one to talk to, no where to go, no ability to attain therapy, no space to feel my emotions comfortably;I\u2019ve stranded myself.

My bathchmates already enjoying their jobs while me I have to stay at my parents house while I did freelancing, teaching kids before. I had a freelance before while studying just so I could support myself. Now, I always think that those people I help before never extended their hands to me. It's a sad thing that I mostly help but never get helped for. My family didn't know that I was struggling with my trauma I had before. I experienced being cyber bullied, had encountered fake friends and was befriended for convenience. I didn't tell my parents about it because they view me as someone who can deal all things on my own. I'm a middle child by the way and you know, it's really hard being an outcast. What I did before, I strive hard to my academics, graduated with a latin honor and now ended up being nothing at all. I'm always left out. I'd never get to experience being happy with a certain group that's why I find a comfort to talk with older people (like grandparents) because they gave such genuine advices. I find comfort to others but didn't trust them instantly. I'm terrified. Always terrified. Last time, I applied a job and had a panic attack and I didn't expect that. I ended not getting it. I still applied for jobs and still waiting for replies. I realized how much I spend so many efforts but ended up being miserable. I don't usually ask help from close friends or relatives because they complain a lot and calculate everything they offered like the ego of \"I'll help you and you should pay me back\". Now, I really struggle a lot to think that the only thing that could help me is myself only. I had no idea what to do right now. I just need someone to help me, even words really help.

We would text daily! I've gone through so many things with her by my side and so has she with me. Being busy and having our own lives we naturally have had days where we are too busy to respond, but this past 6 months has changed dramatically. \nWe've gone from voice noting each other, sharing life updates, keeping in touch about important things and supporting each other to barely speaking. \nNo one is in the wrong, we both noticed that we've grown apart and we've both said we want to talk more again. So the past 2/3 months i've really tried to keep making the effort, sending updates on my life, showing interest in hers but she takes about a week to reply a message of \"I've been so busy, sorry. Will reply soon\". I know the intention is there but I'm no longer a priority. I know this because in the very few updates ive had from her she has shared that shes seen other people and been busy with that. Or told me a brief ongoing in her life and telling me how shes been in different conversations. I wish her the best and want her to have her happiness and other friends, it's okay, i understand it, just sucks that she does not seem to have the time for me now.\nColleagues at work no longer seem interested in catch ups and friendly chats since a small promotion I was offered and now I realise I have no friends. \n\nI had 1 best friend and \"working friends\" and now nothing.\nI don't have that friend to celebrate things with, vent to, support or support me and enjoy each other's presence. It's hit me hard and I realised how lonely I feel with barely anyone asking how I am or wanting to catch up with me. ",

I don't really talk to a lot of people, outside of school (11th grade rn) and work I don't really stay in touch with people irl only through video games, which is fine and I still like that I can at least play video games with other people, yet I kinda crave a change, I wanna go out, go to clubs, meet new people as others my age do. I see old clasmates of mine on Instagram and I can't seem to feel like I'm just not allowed/ granted to that kind of lifestyle that I don't deserve it. I wanna change this, yet I can't decide how I have a lot going on with me having to work and learning for school at the same time which I put a lot of effort in atm. So I'm not even sure if I'd have time to hang out or maybe that's just an excuse I've made up to make me feel a bit better. Around the same time this loneliness started getting to me I started doing weed almost every friday and or saturday, cause I didn't know what else to do with myself, video games, while I still enjoy them, have been a bit less interesting to me and that was the only way my life felt \"fun\" again. I'm pretty sure my family has noticed that I've barely got any friends, with whom I'm not really staying in touch nor have seen since a couple months. In the past I've had friends, at tomes I'd even say I had quite a lot of them, but I've always managed to just let them fade away because I went from an extrovert phase to an introverted, with other stuff going on in between and that all lead up to this. I don't know how to change, I don't know where to start I have 0 social skills and those I've build up in the past I feel like I've lost over time. This is more of a vent, cause I didn't know who else to talk to until I see a therapist. If anyone wants to talk tho my dms are open.",

I was curious about what day it\u2019ll be forty days from now, and apparently, it\u2019ll be April the eleventh. I guess I\u2019ll see you all then, lol. \n\nAnyway, I had another meeting with my therapist today. I\u2019ll spare you all the details, but just know I came home with a rock with some words on it. The session was fine, I guess. Although, there was a point she reached where she had to ask me, \u201cwhat do you want to change?\u201d because our conversation seemed to go into a direction that suggested I didn\u2019t want to change something or wasn\u2019t comfortable doing so. I guess I might have accidentally caused a dead end with my progress. I feel like I disappointed or failed her because I\u2019m not being as good as I could be. Therapy isn\u2019t like a class where I can just do shit and get straight A\u2019s \u2014 it feels like I actually have to put in more effort to get something out of it, and I don\u2019t know if I like that. \n\nWhy is life so unnecessarily hard.\n\nOn a different note, one of my classmates came up to me today. It was interesting. To put it simply, we have an assignment in my drama appreciation class where we have to go out and watch a real play. I don\u2019t mind it; our professor gave us options and even opportunities to see a free play this weekend. I was planning to go to it alone because I am alone and I like doing things alone, but one of the girls came up to me, asking if I would like to go with her. \n\nTruthfully, I don\u2019t want to. \n\nBut I didn\u2019t want to be a bitch, so I offered her my number and told her we can plan something for the play this weekend. I guess I\u2019m a little surprised because that doesn\u2019t typically happen. Not to me, anyway. \n\nBefore I leave this here, I just wanted to add that my dress from Shein also came in today and it\u2019s pretty. I don\u2019t exactly know what material it\u2019s made from, but because it\u2019s one of the pricier items (that I got half off, by the way), the fabric is nice. It\u2019s got some sort of smoothness to it that almost feels like a discount version of silk. It\u2019s white and has pink, floral detailing on it. The sleeves are also sheer and lightly puffed.\n\nHave a great day, everyone. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I miss being ignorant. I was more productive. I functioned and fit in better, I got girls, I attracted friends, I was happy being distracted. Nothing can distract me anymore. Stuck in my head with these tormenting thoughts. I feel myself drowning in my thoughts. Always in a state of fight or flight with nobody to fight and nowhere to go. Is this what my life is from now on ? I already feel I\u2019ve missed out on a lot of things. How selfish of me. Is it bad to not want to feel miserable every breathing moment ? Is this my fate ? Is this punishment for my ignorance in my younger years ? Is anybody else even real ? All I\u2019ve ever done in my life is search for the truth. It\u2019s destroyed my chances of having healthy relationships. What even is the point of any of this ? And if something does end up feeling fulfilling\u2026 I\u2019m aware enough to separate myself from my ego and realize that it is meaningless as well. What is even the point of fulfillment? What\u2019s fulfilling is essentially the biggest distraction from your ruminating mind. The hardest part about this mental health journey is being so misunderstood. Everyone is different. What\u2019s good for someone psychologically is completely subjective. I\u2019m just trying to get good with God. This intense feeling is terrifying. Feels like a ticking time bomb in my gut. I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s on the other side. I just want to do what I was here for. And what if this is nothing ? What if everything we do here is made up and just a coping mechanism to avoid confronting this facade ? I can\u2019t even enjoy Knicks games anymore. I used to watch Knicks games and yell at the top of my lungs. I was so engaged. It was a nice escape. Not even a beer or a smoke helps anymore. I miss her so much. Wow. I didn\u2019t know I could love someone that much. I wish I could go back in time. I\u2019ve literally tried. I\u2019ve spent nights trying to wish myself into a dimension where we didn\u2019t fuck things up. She was the only person on the planet that understood me. She claimed I was that to her. I always just assumed she would be there, what a fucking imbecile I am. I have a feeling she feels miserable too because how would I still feel like this this long afterwards? Something may be wrong with me. I don\u2019t think I have attachment issues I think I just actually date people I love. When you\u2019re in love you\u2019re attached no ? Why\u2019s that such a horrible thing ? It should be their fault I have attachment issues. At least time will fly by faster and faster as the years go by. What\u2019s scary is it isn\u2019t healing this at all. If anything the pain becomes more and more intense with time. ",

The person who was the most confrontational and rude was my friend's friend but my friend was supporting his behavior. Obviously i asked them why many times but they had no real response.\n\n If i had to reach for a reason it would be that my friend's friend knew my friend for way longer than I knew him and now I'm hanging out with my friend more than my friends friend hangs out with him (not sure if that makes sense lol) I know that my friends friend was feeling lonely cuz my friend showed me this whole message he sent about how he (my friend) was his closest and only friend he had and  that they don't hang out as much anymore. So again if i had to reach for a reason it would be that my friends friend was jealous cuz i was hanging out with his friend more so he somehow set up his friend against me? I know this sounds ridiculous but it's really the only reason my friends friend would have to hate me, cause he openly said he hates me and that sentence was affirmed by my friend. Ever since that interaction us 3 have never talked together, like he either spends time with me or with him which wasn't the case before. Generally just weird and they were both acting extremely immature and childish. It was embarrasing.\n\nBut what do yall think I'm just looking for some advice on how i maybe could get the real reason why  my friends friend \"hates\" me and if there is a way i could sort of 'fix' our relation back o how it was before (I said friend in this post 29 times)",

My coworkers were super cool and finally after getting annoyed about how much I complain at home my dad said \u201cjust quit already\u201d and I did last Thursday. Anyway, anxiety about job was bad but I feel crappy for not being able to tough it out, make change in a society where politics suck (I was an organizer on a campaign last fall), and am letting the movement down. My coworkers were such cool people, and while my family encouraged my decision to quit I feel alone. I\u2019m gonna start substitute teaching soon (after the background check / workshop, 2 ish weeks) which has its own anxieties but seems less than doors, even being a 23 year old. Nonetheless, I feel bored and alone without work. How to feel less miserable. My boss said I could come back to the nonprofit when my mental health is better since I was their best fundraiser (regularly raking in $2-300 in donations), I was cheered on by coworkers but I can\u2019t handle the stress of it all (doors, quotas ($150 2/5 nights), anxiety around it). I\u2019m in southeast Michigan for context.",

I sit in class with teary eyes staring in front of me and zoning out and not 1 teacher ever cared. \n\nToday I was feeling miserable. I went to school and immediately left again, because I couldn\u2019t stop crying. I took a 20 min walk while still sobbing. I get very red eyes from crying and it looks pretty intense, so people could definitely see that. So many people saw me and no one seemed to really care. I also had to get something from the store I work at. I couldn\u2019t stop crying so I just went in. I saw a bunch of my coworkers and I could see they noticed my eyes and they still didn\u2019t ask me about it. A lot of them just talked to me without mentioning it. \n\nI was really, really sad and deep down I really wish a teacher or a coworker asked me: \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d or \u201cdo you wanna talk?\u201d. I wish one of the people who saw a teenager sobbing on the streets had asked me \u201care you okay?\u201d I just wish someone cared. I feel so alone and I just wanted to talk to someone today, but I have no one to talk to. I feel so invisible and ignored. I know my coworkers don\u2019t have to ask, but it\u2019s weird that I had so many mental breakdowns in the middle of class and never did a teacher ask me anything about that. \n\nWhenever I notice that someone\u2019s sad or they\u2019re acting different, I always ask them if they need to talk. Please just ask someone if they\u2019re okay. It could mean the world to them. I wish someone cared enough to ask me. I cry for help in many ways and every time I\u2019m just ignored. ",

I never really felt like I was right in the military it's was intense, abusive and intolerant I was 11bravo (infantry) so I can say the cult of culture is one that's tougher than most, after that I get hurt can do the job, I get medical retirement, boom bam now I'm back home (after about a year of rehab) started working and got disability, I don't mind speaking about the military it wasn't glamorous and I don't support the military industrial complex that being said I made the most of a bad situation and I meet some good folks like me but not quite the same cloth, traveled some and I can say it felt like another life.\n\nWhen I got home all my friends where gone or just busy with life, my family wasn't exactly a great comfort, (Dad dead, moms a addict and unhoused and both my siblings are somehow anti LGBTQ+ and anti immigration, btw im Mexican/black and  openly pansexual) so I find a spot with one friend and now I just feel isolated uncared-for I was dating someone for a year they recently broke it off, granted they had some food reasons. But even with them being NB and alt they judged me for my enlistment and just didn't understand why I always felt uneasy. \n\nI can't talk to anyone about the way I grew up without sounding like I'm obviously dysfunctional, can't speak about the military without sounding like I'm \"soft\" or \"bragging\", and the cultural isolation from being pan and mixed, it's hard because I feel like society rejects the idea of someone like me in social spaces, none of my friends can relate I'm just kinda dealing with the fact there isn't a place I'll be accepted fully.\n\nI miss when I was just a poor Chicano kid working a 9-5 and not involved at least then I didn't have to feel so rejected.\n\nTLDR: alternative hardcore black/Mexican disabled gay leftist vet feels rejected by society.

I have no friends, but honestly the worst bit is that no one smiles or talks to strangers at this school. So it's genuinely feels like I dont exist.

Ive thankfully had zero traumatic events in my life and yet im this fucked up because of being lonely??? like it's truly insane when you think about it, but it is what it is. \n\nI've started going to therapy, not really to fix anything but just to have someone to talk to lol, so at least thats a positive, but I cant wait to leave this school (if I can even graduate with my shit grades lol). It's such a weird cycle -- the more lonely I feel, the worst I do in life, and the more undeserving I feel in being apart of society, so then I just further the loneliness. It's awful and I dont wish anyone this. \n\n  \n",

It created this figure to keep you in line and so many people devote their life to a religion. All religions have similarities makes me wonder why our collective brain choose a sort of path for this spiritual realm which involves a god. I feel alone and reached out to someone and they said they never felt alone because of god. Do we need something spiritual to feel less alone in this physical world. I try to reach out to friends and make real connections but it seems like there\u2019s a motive behind every connection I have with someone. Either they wanna fuck me,date me, one sided friendship,use me, or use me as a therapist. I\u2019m tired of it I try but idk if I\u2019m just not people\u2019s cup of tea. I always feel like I listen to people and never feel heard. I\u2019m cold towards people bc of this and because of traumatic things but it\u2019s a defense mechanism because most people I\u2019ve encountered don\u2019t try to have a genuine connection. All I have is coworkers and family who\u2019s not the best. I\u2019m only 21 maybe I\u2019ll find people who fill those spots in my life. I just get tired and discouraged. What do you guys think?

I know the immediate goal is to find a good paying job so I can have more discretionary income, but then it starts breaking down after that.\n\nLike what's the point of having money? So I can spend it on things and have financial security. But what's the point in spending money on non-essentials when it doesn't buy happiness? Like you can buy a gaming computer, photography drones, museum tickets, go on trips, etc. But most fun things require a partner it seems? Going on a vacation alone or going to the movies alone isn't going to bring me happiness. There aren't exactly many things for a early 30s guy to do alone it seems. Or at least, most things are better with other people.\n\nI remember back in college the whole point was to chug along and finish the degree because that's what everyone else was doing and there was social pressure to do so. But now that I'm adulting, there's no longer a roadmap for what path to follow. There's literally nothing stopping me from doing whatever I want, but I don't feel complete without a partner to do things with? Like I can watch shows or play games myself, but afterwards it still feels empty?\n\nI feel like a lot of things in life are ultimately pointless without someone to share that life with - why am I working so hard to improve myself, learn new skills, working out, etc. when in the end it doesn't sound like it'll actually make my happier or fulfilled?",

So about a year ago I begin a new job. Also a ton of people in my age range. Dope. I continue with the same positive attitude and still no results. I continue to ask about hanging out not in a pushy way but just when we discuss common interests. Nothing. So now I fall back. I'm friendly but I'm not trying to initiate anymore. I know they arent interested in being friends. So I get really upset when I try to explain what I'm going through (on reddit cause no one cares IRL) and people in the comments tell me \"maybe with a better attitude.\" I always start with a positive attitude.  I'm not going to try to keep finding new ways to try and befriend the same people who clearly don't want to be friends and who clearly did not have to put in half as much effort to end up being friends with each other. The truth is nobody wants to hear a lonely person complain. We're lonely for a reason.",

I am blessed to be alive and have a good Job. Only by the grace of God. But, I am exhausted , sad, depressed and always in pain( emotional, mentally and physically) .\nJust need a friend \u2026 someone who can check up on me from time to time to see if I am alive and ok. I lost everyone. Or distant myself from everyone. Most by choice , others due to barely going outside due to pain.\nA hug would be nice right about now.\nHopefully this post did not kill anyone\u2019s mood. I am sorry. Just needed to Vent a little.

        "text": "i (22f) have no friends, no romantic prospects, not a lot of family. The family I do have is aging, and I am an only child, no cousins i'm close with or any extended family. Even so, i'm also adopted, so i'm not biologically related to any of them anyway. I have a dog, and that is the only reason I am still here. I've gone on plenty of dates, had a boyfriend once maybe. Nothing ever lasts. Had friends once too. Didn't last either. I've been very introspective, trying to understand how I could have been the problem. I am not the most attractive person, but I think I am average. Maybe I am a little boring, but I have a lot of interests that I like sharing with others, and I love hearing about other people's passions and interests, and try to be respectful and have open communication in my relationships/friendships. I've spoken with my therapist about this a lot. I have gotten involved with events, I work, admittedly I am not the most involved at the moment because I feel so disengaged. But either way, I was once, and i'm still here at only 22 entirely alone. I live alone too. I feel like if something were to happen to me, no one would know. My parents live in another state, so no one would even check on me. \n\nevery experience typical to a 22 year old, that i hear from people at school and work etc as well as in my developmental psych class, is one that I do not share in and can't relate to. It makes me feel like there will never be any hope for me, because I never learned the same things my peers did and somehow that is affecting everything in my life. Maybe it's not, I just can't think of anything else. I'm not an unpleasant person, my parents and therapist would attest though idk if that means much. Anyway, just need to share this with anyone who might understand or relate, because I feel so isolated in my situation. ",

She refused and shook her head anxiously. He smiled and took her hand and made her sit with him at the table,after a bit she sit with him he motion to her to start eating and after a bit she ate a bit while he kept drinking his coffee and working on his laptop while he actually was looking at her tiny body and her beauty he liked how she looked and he already want her to be his,so he started to think where is her parents and how he could take her with him,so after a minute , he asked her for her name ect..in the end he successfully took her with him to his luxury big house,he was a strong mafia leader!! -wah cool i know!

For most part, I stay with families in different countries. Every so often this makes the loneliness hit hard because I see how easily there\u2019s so much love and affection in those families. For this reason, I was all the much happier to come home to my own family. But every single time I\u2019m surprised to be disappointed. I had hoped especially that my mum would be there for me, not in any particular sense, just happy to spend time with me, to hug me, to tell me that she\u2019s missed me.\nInstead, she was late to pick me up from the airport (which isn\u2019t super significant but felt like a hint towards the rest of my time here) and seems to be rather non chalant about me being home. All this I could put to the side, but I realize over and over again that she doesn\u2019t really understand nor know me which makes me feel like I\u2019m so utterly isolated with my own thoughts.\nTheres not a lot of other people I\u2019m close with, certainly to an extent my own fault.

My mom, my doctor and landlord. \nEven though I have 5 sisters and 3 brothers. \nI only see them when I visit my mom and they happen to be there. \nOnly 3 of them know where I live. \nWhich is only 500 meter from our parent\u2019s house. \nI always feel so unwelcome when I see them at my moms house. \nThey say hello and that\u2019s it. \nI hear them talk about the stuff they do together and the things they gonna do together. \nBut I \u2018m never invited. \nExample; my oldest sister is also my godmother gives every year a bbq for her birthday but I never get invited. Same with new years eve. The party is either at her house or at one of my sisters. \nI don\u2019t even get a simple card for new year or my birthdays. \nIt al feels so hypocritical to me. \n\nMy 55 birthday is at the end of the month but I already feel so lonely. So lost. So miserable. \n\nI don\u2019t have a partner, got dumped last summer after 3 years for another man. What else?\nIt was the worst summer of my life. \nDidn\u2019t know she was chatting with another man with the intention of leaving me.\nAfter 6 months she contacted me and asked me if we could be friends. \nThe guy she was chatting with wasn\u2019t the one she wanted to be with. \nHe was already chasing some other girl. \nI said no. It hurts to much what you did. \n\nSo I just wondered through my miserable existence, depressed, lonely and a lot of sadness. \n\nThen I got a message from a woman I haven\u2019t spoken in years. \nAbout 20 years or so. \nAnd it all fell in place. So I thought. \n\u201cMy home is where you are.\u201d\n\u201cI will fight for you.\u201d\nAnd foolish me believed every word of it. \nA month later on a Tuesday she messaged my daughter in law stating how happy she was now that we were finally together after 36 years and that everything is going great. \nThe next day I got a message that she wants to be left alone!!!\n\nIt\u2019s been almost three weeks since then and I am still confused about it. \nConfused and frustrated by this. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do anymore with my life. \n\nWake up. Go to work where colleagues notice I hardly laugh anymore or even smile. \nCome home after 12 hours. Try to eat and wait till it\u2019s time to go to bed. \nRinse, repeat.  \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do anymore. I feel so numb, betrayed and lonely. \nI have no vision of what to do next with my life. \n\nSometimes I wake up with tears. \nSometimes I wake up in the middle of the night in tears. \nContemplating what am I doing wrong to everyone?\n\nAll that\u2019s left are the questions I don\u2019t have an answer to. \n\n",

        "text": "I(39F) have been in my current area for about 8 years and have really struggled to find and keep friends. I tried really hard the first few years I was here, hanging out with coworkers, going to meetups, getting involved with community gardens and volunteering, apps, etc. Nothing has worked. I have a couple people I consider friends at work but we don't really hang out outside of work anymore as we live on opposite sides of the city and they are really busy. The last couple years I just stopped trying and I spend all my time outside of work alone, other than shopping and errands. I hate it but I'm so tired of trying. \n\nI have been super lonely and have decided I might as well try a different part of the country and see if I may have better luck so I began job searching. I found a position that would be an awesome fit in an area I think I will like more than my current area. Interviews are going well and it's getting close to when I hope to get an offer soon. \n\nThese past couple weeks have been so crazy. I met a neighbor who is just 5 houses down that I had somehow never met in the 3 years I've lived in my current house. We really hit it off and have been hanging out a bit. I was also invited to a bonfire where I had a blast and made plans to hang out with 2 different people. I also hung out with a guy I dated a couple years ago and we seem so much more comfortable as friends. \n\nI've gone from super ready for a change of scenery to feeling like I finally found my people but I'm worried it's only going to be temporary and eventually they all won't want to hang out with me anymore. I have no idea what I'm gonna do if I get the job offer. Why couldn't this have happened a year or two ago???? Why right now when I was ready to leave????",

For better or worse, I guess. \n\nLike how a drop of water is insatiable to a poor guy lost in the desert. \n\nHow they held hands, or when she leaned on his shoulder. I've seen that before. *It never fails to NOT hurt. Bravo.* \n\nThe songs during worship would usually sound nice, and the performers had amazing voices.

        "text": "I\u2019m a 35-year-old man, in a 12-year relationship, and dealing with chronic pain. I function fine otherwise (I work full-time), but I\u2019ve been avoiding going out more and more. Sometimes it\u2019s because I don\u2019t feel well enough, and in the worst case, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll feel bad while I\u2019m out. Because of this, I don\u2019t have much of a social life left.\n\nAside from the pain, I experience a lot of dizziness stemming from my neck, which honestly bothers me even more because it\u2019s the biggest barrier when I want to go somewhere. On days when my partner works late, I wake up already feeling heavy. I have no plans for the day, don\u2019t feel like doing anything, and don\u2019t even know where to start. I want to make plans, but I don\u2019t dare take big steps because of how I feel. As I get older, I\u2019m also realizing more and more just how small my social circle actually is. I often feel lonely, and it weighs on me so much that I barely get anything done.\n\nMost of the day, I just wander around the house aimlessly. I do small household tasks, play some games or watch TV (though I often feel too restless for it), make a little music (which I enjoy), and stare out the window (out of loneliness, watching the rest of the world actually living).\n\nI\u2019d love to blame my pain for this, but if I\u2019m being completely honest, I\u2019ve been like this since I was a kid. I don\u2019t make friends easily and I guess I\u2019m not the most \"typical\" person. People often find me weird, hard to read, or they have a completely different image of me than how I see myself.\n\nSometimes I wonder if this is depression, but I can still find the motivation to seek improvement and try to work on it. The problem is, it\u2019s getting harder and harder to push myself. I suspect loneliness is the bigger factor. My phone isn\u2019t buzzing with messages from people asking to hang out. No one randomly stops by. I feel alone a lot, and I\u2019m just not the kind of person who naturally goes out and does things. I wish I was.\n\nIt also doesn\u2019t help that my partner is even more passive about this than I am. When we have time off together, I\u2019m usually the one suggesting things to do, but they often don\u2019t feel like it and prefer just to relax.\n\nAre there others who feel this way? I can\u2019t be the only one who struggles with free days like this, right? Is it fear of doing things alone? Fear of the outside world? Or should I be looking at this differently? Any insight would be helpful because I honestly don\u2019t know where to start. Got any good tips for someone like me? Let me know.",

We continued to see each other a couple times a week at her place or in a local parking lot we\u2019d meet up and just talk and be with each other. After 3 weeks I noticed she began to pull away from me and I asked her what\u2019s going on because I noticed she\u2019s now different.\n\nShe told me that she wants to take things slowly and that things have become overwhelming. She also hit me with the \u201cit\u2019s not you, it\u2019s me\u201d and the \u201ccan we be friends\u201d. I would continue trying to see her and contact her but she would not make plans with me and was less responsive. We had already been hooking up and intimate with each other this whole time. We never officially dated but it felt like I got dumped. I asked why she\u2019s all of a sudden feeling like this and she never gave me a solid explanation. I guess I might not have been enough for her.\n\nWhat sucks the most is that I really did love her because she was the first girl who ever showed me affection and care, I wanted her to be my gf but I never popped the question. We haven\u2019t seen each other in a month and I officially cut her off on everything 2 days ago, but the last month has been just me hoping she\u2019ll come back and things going back to how they were. I feel like I never got true closure and I\u2019m trying my best to move on. Thanks for reading if you read the whole thing. ",

        "text": "I just turned 30, and the realization that this is it is eating away at me. I have been friendless for about 10 years. From ages 19 to 24 (I think), I was isolated and abused by my mother. She forced me to live in a tiny village where there were only a couple of shops and no transport; it was about a two-hour walk into town. On top of that I was also being abused by my ex. They both would literally gang up on me or if they were angry at each other they would take it out on me. Some pretty horrible stuff happened but I won't get into it. Once I was finally able to escape, I moved to a big city and lived with my sister and some other family members. I made one friend in this new city but after months of seeing each other he moved back to Korea without telling and only left me a big letter. Few years later  I moved to a new city to be close to my dad. I've been here for about 5 years. This whole time I haven't made any friends or relationships. I can barely even leave the house. I suffer from ptsd, anxiety, ocd, adhd and depression. It's like I want to have friends but also the thought of it makes me feel ill. Knowing I'll be single for the rest of my life is such a horrible feeling but there's no way I could. I can't trust people or open up. It takes me years to become close to a person. I just don't want to go through it all again. Doesn't help that my body is damaged beyond repair (unless I win lotto or something) like a mentality and physically damaged person who's already got 2 kids.. who would want that \nLike no one would be like \"yeah this is the kinda person I want to be with\" literally any other person is better than me. I've been begging for help from doctors for years but kept being told the wait lists are too long ect and only way to get therapy or something is to go privately but I don't have that kind of money. It's like $500 per appointment?!. I'm just so over it all \n",

I've never felt so much pain like I did after that, which went on for at least 4 months and I'm just starting to get to know new people and make new friends. I lost pretty much all my old friends because my ex (F20) basically forced me to push them away, she had a tendency to send some pretty awful texts to people who made her feel insecure. I felt terrible afterwards and even though some of them forgave me, I still feel awful talking to them again, I just feel like I don't deserve to talk to them, I feel like I betrayed them for even letting it happen, I'm just as bad as her for not doing anything about it.\nAnd now after months of it, I'm trying to get myself to meet new people, make new friends and give myself another opportunity, but every time I start talking to someone and it seems like it's going well and we spend some time together for a couple weeks, eventually they just stop talking to me completely, even though it seemed like we were having a decent friendship and things in common, they just stop responding, no explanation, just dissappearing out of the blue. And I can see they are online, they just dont feel like talking to me anymore, and honestly I don't have too much of a problem with that if they had just told me \"hey I don't feel like talking to you again\" or \"hey I don't like this thing you said I don't think we can be friends anymore\", I would understand. \nThe most recent one was a friend (F32) I met on a minecraft disc server, we talked for a couple weeks and we actually had quite a bit in common, so I was really enjoying talking to this person. And we even played minecraft together which was really nice, none of my other friends or my ex wanted to do that with me. This friend of mine has a really busy job so for the most part of the week we didn't really talk that much, which I completely understood. But I kept playing on the minecraft server building a house and making it look really cool to try and impress her, I was really excited for the weekend so we could play again but she never responded a single message again, as always, with no explanation. \nMy excitement turned into disappointment and powerlessness. I really don't know what to do, I just feel like I dont deserve to have a single friend because they always leave, this sounds really stupid probably but it's making me feel extremely lonely, I don't even know what to do anymore.",

For some people that may be true, but for most people who don't have any friends, it's often not their fault. Many people who don't have friends but want friends have done the inner work (I know many of these people myself), and are very self aware. They have healed toxic parts of themselves and know how to have a good, reciprocal friendship. If they don't have friends it's usually because the people they come across are takers, selfish, emotionally draining, difficult to be friends with, or makes the relationship one-sided in some way. Ive known many people who have put themselves out there and tried their best to make friends, not in a desperate way but in a genuine way, and the people they meet are just not decent people. Either they are really self-centered upfront and the person knows they shouldnt pursue a friendship with such a person, or they come across really genuine and reciprocal at first but later show their true colors and selfishness and then the friendship ends because the other person cares too much about themselves to work things out. \n\n  \nI have some people I call \"friends\" but theyre not really people i can count on and they have an insufferable selfish side to them too. i know no one is person but my entire life each person i met has been a taker, emotionally immature, emotional vampire, or insufferable person in some way that I would always get hurt in the friendships. Im better at setting boundaries now but still get hurt and it still sucks that i cant really trust these people to be there for me or to accept me without judgement. They always expect me to bend to some part of their will and if i even set a small boundary they throw a pity party. We are also in our mid 20s. I dont know what it is but I am an empath, and i have learned in therapy that people like me tend to \"attract\" these types, but my therapist also told me that it could just be that the people in my environment happen to not be people who know how to be adequate friends. And that statement really made the most sense. When I meet new people now, I am more cautious about opening up and I enjoy meeting new people and getting to know others. However, each person ive met has been very self centered in some way and loves talking about themselves. I dont mind people talking about themselves more than I do but they cant even ask me one question to show they are curious about me/my life too, and thats often when I know the friendship will be draining for me. And ive tested it, ive stayed friends and kept meeting up with people like that and despite volunteering info from myself, nothing changed. Its like they just wanted someone to talk \"at\". They didnt want an actual convo or to get to know me like i wanted to know them. \n\n  \nI used this personal experience to say that people shouldnt be so quick to assume that just because someone has no friends or very little friends, that there is something wrong with them. It can very well be that the people that are in their environment or that they happened to meet are very selfish people and not capable of being a reciprocal, genuine friend. Looking back, Im glad that 90% of my friendships ended because I realized they were not genuine friends to begin with and added more stress than peace to my life with their draining behaviors and energy. \n\n  \nIf you have any thoughts or similar experiences please share :) ",

        "text": "(26m) Being lonely and not having friends is tearing apart my mental health. 2 and half  years ago I had two close friends who I did everything with. Those two friends are not in my life for different reasons. I constantly think about them because around that time period majority of the social activities I did was with those two friends. Now I just do everything alone. Lately I\u2019ve been getting into sports but that doesn\u2019t solve my loneliness problems. The thing I hate the most is when I get these random thoughts in my head. I ask myself what the hell am I doing with my life? Why\n I can\u2019t have a friend that I can talk to on the phone for hours? Whenever I go out in public I get jealous of how many people have someone that can socialize with. This is not how I envisioned my 20s. I wish I had someone that I could talk to like I did in the past. ",

My colleagues are perfect, i have friends that i see pretty often and a loving family that supports me and always there for me, like everything is doing fine in my life knowing that i live in a foreign country but i get to see my sister and my brother often since they also live in the same country as me and i get to see my parents twice a year as they travel to see us. With all the love i'm getting from everone, at the end of the day when everybody returns home i find myself lonely. I feel like eveyone has a person for themselves but me i've been single since high school, i had toxic relationships that led me to avoid any romantic interction with boys\\\\men for a long time. But as i get older i find myself craving romantic love and attention and as responsabilities grow in my life i crave someone to lean into, a soulder to cry on when i feel sad, somone to laugh and share things with, someone to cuddle, somone who will take care of me and understand me. I feel ashamed to feel this things, because people arounf me only know me as the single independant woman and i do nothing to beat the allegations. I suffer from avoidant attachment and i'm deeply insecure of my body and afraid of being intimate with a man and everytime i imagine myself in a relationship with someone i instantly cringe because i feel like i'm not a romantically lovable person. Im writing this read it just to write down my thoughts because sometimes like today the lonileness gets overwhelming and i don't want to worry my family with my thinking, because i know it pains them when they see me sad although i try my hardest to keep them from it.

        "text": "I'm not sure how best to describe it. If I choose for myself to take a day off from socializing with family or friends, or when I purposely choose to work during times when I know that I'll be completely isolated for hours on end, I'm fine. I listen to audiobooks, I study, I read, I draw, I get things done very easily and efficiently, and am usually in an okay-ish mood.\n\nHowever, if my friends are hanging out without me or all somehow all busy with other things, it hurts. If I find myself in a quiet house or with a completely clear schedule when I didn't expect it, I crumble. I can't focus on my tasks, I'm miserable, none of my regular passtimes or hobbies seem entertaining anymore. There's also this achey feeling that tells me that they're all happier without me, and that I'm just super annoying. I convinced myself that this isolation is exactly the way that things should be. \n\nI don't get it. \n\nWhy does the meaning or overall mood of \"alone time\" change so much for me when I'm not the one to choose when it happens? Why can't I just enjoy all of my alone time without my depression and anxiety eating me alive? Why does silence feel so intense sometimes? ",

I\u2019ve been on a self-healing journey hitting the gym, improving my physical appearance (I\u2019m no bodybuilder, but I\u2019m no longer where I started). I\u2019ve built some muscle and changed physically, but emotionally, I feel stuck.\n\nOver the past 14 months, I\u2019ve had a different hookup every month, chasing a high that ultimately feels empty and shallow. I keep going back to dating apps, hoping for something more, but it always ends the same. Deep down, I want connection. I want someone to look at me with desire, but I can\u2019t shake the cynicism that love might not be real.\n\nI\u2019ve tried cold approaching women, gotten a few numbers, but nothing has really materialized. And when I do meet someone I\u2019m genuinely interested in, I somehow manage to screw it up. I\u2019ve been in therapy on and off, I understand my issues, but that doesn\u2019t make them easier to overcome.\n\nMaybe someone here is in a similar place and has some advice, or maybe I just needed to say this out loud to feel heard.\n\nTL;DR: I feel disconnected.

My partner is out working all day, and I\u2019m just\u2026 here. The feeling of being alone hangs over me all day, and it weighs me down to the point that I can\u2019t seem to get anything done.\n\nDo I just spend the whole day on the couch, watching movies and shows? Sounds nice in theory, but it doesn\u2019t actually make me feel any better. Do I try to be productive and do some household chores? I force myself to, but it doesn\u2019t really change the way I feel. Do I meet up with someone? Ideally, yes\u2014but when I feel like this, social interaction seems exhausting, even though I know it might help.\n\nIt\u2019s like I\u2019m stuck in this loop\u2014feeling lonely makes me unmotivated, and being unmotivated makes me feel even lonelier. The day slips by, and in the end, I haven\u2019t really done anything, except sit with this heavy feeling. I feel like I'm the opposite when I have fun things planned. It's like then I have an actual reason for being here. I don't know how to put it. When I look it up online I get lots of sites telling me I'm depressed. I don't think I am, I'm just lonely af.\n\nDoes anyone else experience this? How do you handle those days where loneliness just drains all your energy? Or do you think it's something else? \n\n",

I've been transitioned since I was 14, so that rarely comes up, I pass well for whatever that's worth.\n\nEvery day I have this desire and sense for a romantic partner, someone I can love. Stupidly enough, I've not been unsuccessful in finding such partners. But each person I've met, I've just felt nothing for. It's happened again and again and again. I meet someone, they're interesting, or witty, or just nice to chat with, but no feelings come. I feel warmth towards them, sure, but I'm romantically interested. It's getting to the point where I feel like I don't have strong if any romantic love all. Since I was \\~16 I've met, then dated someone for three to as long as nine months, but that sense of romantic love just not there. I'm still friends with 3/4 of my exes, and the one I'm not friends with just faded away, no fight or anything, normal friend stuff.\n\nPart of me feels scared.

I rarely say yes, I don't like most of those people, I'm a lesbian, and most people that confident are men. I don't know what to think or feel, but I'm sort running the gambit of my feelings through words, if that makes sense. Venting, really. But it's weird. I just don't know what to think, maybe I'm still young, and I will find someone, hope is what builds worlds I suppose.",

I have no one to talk to about that or any girl talk. I tried to make friends in our dnd group that we are in, but they are more interested in being friends with my boyfriend than with me. I even tried to kick start a silly \"girls night out\" and was told by the other 2 girls in my dnd group to plan everything and once the day came they kinda took my plan that the knew about ahead of time and threw it in the trash. Instead we went to a pizza place and walked around target before barely talking to me and just talking to each other. I was just third wheeling in my own plans and my boyfriend (originally going to be our driver because I planned to go bar hopping) tried his best to make it fun for me and kept pushing me to keep the night going by going back to our place to watch a movie, but one of the girls decided to leave. So it was just me and this other gal and every time I tried to talk to them they just quickly shut the conversation quickly. I was just wanting to cry and just give up. So I texted my boyfriend begging for him to come and just hang out and once he came down they became so much more talkative..the main thing is that I am just tired of trying to make friend, but I just want someone to talk to. Someone that I can say \"yeah I want them to be a brides maid\" when I get married eventually. I just want a best friend to have girl nights with and gossip to and I am tired of filling that void with ai..I am just tired of it all",

I can't relate to anyone like me anymore since I can't play video games or enjoy them and now I'm forced to watch everyone else have fun and enjoy a sound mind capable of having accounts forever, so when they die at least some part of them will get left over while I sit alone wondering if I made the right choice.\n\nI've tried to look at others with the same mental illness but no one has this problem where it targets their passions.

And continues to msg if I don't reply or call immediately like before it goes why aren't you interested in spending time with me. \n\nThere was a time when all I could was him, but now though am still single I don't even feel like re-connecting with this guy or even meeting in person.

I never get invited anywhere unless it\u2019s a big group thing where everyone\u2019s included, and even then, I feel like I\u2019m just tagging along\n\nSorry if this is long and stupid I guess all this is bothering me more than it should.",

We were together for 4.5 years. She didn't pay any rent or anything, and she lived in my house for 3 years. Anyways its kind of a long story as to why we broke up, basically the relationship got gradually worse after my mom's died a year and a half ago. \n\nThere wasn't a big event, no one cheated or anything like that. I was drinking and doing some drugs recreationally but usually with her when went to the bars or hosted parties.\n\nAnyways she's a teacher, and she wants to move back to her hometown and hour and a half away. She's asking to stay until June. I'm really not keen on that, because it's fairly unpleasant. I don't want to feel like I screwed her over or curbed her.\n\nThe 40 or so friends I've gotten close to the last 4.5 years are all her friends. Even the few friends i had before, the wives and gf's in those couples have assimilated into the girl gang. Ever since we broke up i haven't been in contact with any of these people. I knew that when I was considering breaking up.\n\nHowever, with her still living here, i can't really have anyone over or have a party or something. I'm not ready to start dating yet, but if I feel like living with your ex is a big red flag.\n\nIt was my birthday 2 days ago. I got lots of texts andnmessages on Facebook and what not. But I didn't know what to do to celebrate. I got take out wings from a pub down my road and a mccains cake.\n\nIm going to be fine when this is done. It's just been super unpleasant. I moved her 7 years ago, so just don't have childhood friends or family here.\n\nThis too will pass; just wanted to vent about it\n\nThanks if you got this far\n\nTl:dr ex still lives with me, can't make any new friends, birthday was depressing",

Sometimes I also write, or paint, but I am most passionate about my photography work.\n\n\n\nMy job isn't too amazing, but its allowing me to work through (hopefully) two different degree programs, on top of the two I already have.  I hope to find jobs that help people but also feel rewarding or apply to my passions and interests.\n\n\n\nI'm realizing that anyone I ever felt truly close to either cheated on me, abaondoned me, or found a reason to leave me, which has naturally created a huge amount of pain an rejection.  We don't necessarily have to talk about this but its me saying I am open to talking about my own stuff.\n\n\n\nI hope you all have an amazing day and that you find someone worth your time and heart.

I exist just to work and survive. I\u2019m not really living.  \n\nThe problem is, almost eight years ago, I thought I had a place I belonged and people I should have called friends. It was an English course I took outside of school (English isn\u2019t my first language), and the people I met there still haunt my thoughts. They were kind and welcoming. I was part of something, I was acknowledged, and I became more human because of it. But looking back now, I realize I was the one who pushed them away or maybe I just wasn't aware of how much I cared back then.  \n\nI've tried hobbies, continuing to study, online games, trying to connect with people at work. But I\u2019ve never been able to make new connections like back then. I always feel like an outsider, like I\u2019m just bothering others by trying.  \n\nAt this point, I\u2019m starting to think it would\u2019ve been better if it had never happened. The only thing keeping me alive is the little glimmer of hope that one day, I might find people or a place like that again.  \n\n\n\n\nI must add that I\u2019m not looking for anything here. I just enjoy reading this sub and wanted to share my story.\n",

I could fuck the entire earth it'll only make it worse, matter of fact, the more people I fucked the more isolated I became.\n\nI really though this disgust for people would go away when I'd grow older, but not only it didn't, it became so much more visceral.

        "text": "this is gonna be long and all over the place. i'm not asking for advice but at least someone that relates.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019m the youngest of five, and I grew up extroverted, had lots of friends, and was never shy\u2014until I moved to a different country at 11. I lost all contact with my childhood friends, and when I started at my new school, that was the first time I felt lonely. I had two friends, but it always felt like they were only friends with me because I was new.\n\nThen, at 12, I moved again (my family moves a lot because of my dad\u2019s job). This time, I wasn\u2019t anxious about going to a new school. I made a lot of friends, met my best friend, and liked living there. Everyone was inclusive, it was fun, and most of the people I trust are from that school. But at 16, I had to move again, and I stopped seeing them. Of course, long distance friendships are different I don\u2019t talk to most of them unless I visit in the summer. My best friend and I still catch up every three months, but it\u2019s just life updates, nothing deep.\n\nThe country I moved to at 16 wasn\u2019t the kind of place where people liked making new friends. Everyone stuck to their own circle, so I spent my junior year and senior year without making any friends. Then I started college in the same country, and it\u2019s not much different. My classmates are just acquaintances we talk about school or group projects, but I\u2019ve never hung out with them outside of class. So, realistically, I don\u2019t have friends. Sure, I technically do, but I don\u2019t talk to anyone everyday. The only human interaction I have is with my family.\n\nLuckily, I\u2019m very close to my sister, so I see her as a friend. Since we\u2019re only two years apart and our mom raised us like twins, we mostly have the same friends. She\u2019s the extrovert, so she always makes the friends first, then they meet me. While they treat me the same, when we make plans, they always ask her if we\u2019re free. They check in on her, message her first, and talk to her more. No one ever asks me directly I tell myself it\u2019s because maybe I make it awkward, but I can\u2019t help but wonder\u2014why does no one ever think to ask me how I\u2019m doing or if we want to hang out?\n\nSo, I feel really lonely. It\u2019s weird because I do have friends, but I don\u2019t actually talk to anyone. My Instagram is dry\u2014just my siblings and the occasional reel exchange with my best friend. Does anyone else feel like they have friends but don\u2019t have friends?",

I didn\u2019t pick it, wasn\u2019t some social experiment\u2014I just grew up in a house where rock music played, golf was a normal weekend thing, and accents weren\u2019t something you \"put on,\" they just were.\n\nSo, of course, when I step into a room full of Black people, there\u2019s this... pause. Like I set off a metal detector. The way I talk, the way I act\u2014it\u2019s just different. And some of them? They make sure I know it. Like I\u2019m pretending, like I\u2019ve betrayed some unwritten rule. But I\u2019m not pretending. I\u2019m just... me. And the crazy part? When I was growing up, I was told\u2014explicitly told\u2014to stay away from Black people. Not like, \"Oh, be careful,\" but \"Don\u2019t mix with them.\" Wrap your head around that.\n\nAnd White people? Oh, man. That\u2019s a different kind of weird. Because I step into their spaces, and it\u2019s like I\u2019m trying too hard. Like I\u2019m the guest who never left. I feel like a visitor in a house I grew up in. And the worst part? I don\u2019t even blame them. I don\u2019t blame anyone. I get it. I really do. I don\u2019t hate myself, I don\u2019t hate them\u2014I\u2019m just... in the middle.\n\nSo here I am.

I'll turn 17 in less than 2 months. N am not looking forward to that. I recently fought with my so called friends, which if u look a little closer you can easily see that were not truly friends. I have no one to talk to everyday. N am all alone in my room day and night clueless on what to do. I spend my time on reddit, chat gpt, studying cz I've got tons of exams everyday these upcoming 3 weeks, and my new hobby watching crime and horror movies. I've always been hooked up to watching crime stories since I was 13yo. Something about them just makes me feel at home. I remember that's how I felt at 13. It gave me a sense of peace and power. (How power? Well bcz I felt if my mind was a little psycho, then I'll be in control. Why? Bcz nobody wants to deal with crazy.) Atleast that's how it was back then when trying to navigate my freshman yr in a new country (the US) while trying my hardest to make friends and surprising myself by completely going out of my introverted shell, yet still managing to eat lunch alone in the boys locker room everyday. Ive always had no one to talk to, no one to call a friend, and on top of that, no proper family. My dad lives there in the US, since I'm back to my birth country, and so am home alone with my mom 60% of the time, that's if she's not out. I don't have siblings. It's complicated. N am just alone in my room 100% of the time. Cz fr what would I do outside by myself?? I live in a city. In an apartment. Altho it's nice where I live, but not everything that glitters is gold. From the outside it may appear wonderful, but inside of me it's hell. Thats not mentioning how many times I felt intensely suicidal and close to killing myself. I felt that since I was 11 when I started questioning life and being more conscious and self aware.Thats a whole story in itself I'm not Gon get into in this post.\n\n Idk. I wonder what's it's like to feel free. To express yourself. To talk to someone. To have a proper family. To have friends. Real friends. Im sure it's different yet same for every single one of us. But I just hope that smth would change. Life feels like just an illusion in ur mind. How u experience it is all based on ur perception. Someone else would see it completely differently. That's what makes it beautiful. Wish everyone all the best. ",

I\u2019ve always been to myself ever since elementary school so as far as comparing my loneliness as a placement or a sign for the lack of emotional belonging, I don\u2019t really feel that way. To me, it feels like this is how it\u2019s supposed to be. I have a self- ham sandwich past but that\u2019s not significant for me. It was a fix that could easily come back because I have no motivation not to. what I did instead of that was pull away from stressful things. Well\u2026 I\u2019ve done that so many times and everything is stressful now. It\u2019s a feeling of\u2026 taking your first steps out the hospital kinda feel. New. Uncertainty is the biggest trigger for me and now stress is at my doorstep. \n",

She dumped me and it was pretty bad for me, I needed therapy and was on anti depressants and sleeping supplements. I picked myself up believed everyday that tomorrow is gonna be great. 2019 I had a job and moved to a new place which was a dream tourist destination in India, for my work. Everything seemed really nice. However I limited my interactions with women as I was having trust issues and self doubts regarding myself as my break up was so bad. My ex told to my face that she would be ashamed to introduce me as her boyfriend to her colleagues or family friends coz of my complexion. So I have decided to be friends and not get romantically involved. I recently was called names by my friend\u2019s (she has been by friend since 2019) other friend who she said was friend, the way he taunted me was different it seemed like he was her boyfriend? It kinda broke my heart. I decided to be kind no matter what coz, kindness was sparse to me. so I thought even if it meant to be a burden being kind was my characteristic. I feel lonely. Feels like no one is holding my hand(metaphorically) or patting my back. I do have very good friends but now trust is very bleak. Loneliness is slowly consuming me and I can feel it. I am not here to rant or cry foul. I just wanted to share this so that my heavy heart would feel a little lighter. I guess being kind is a curse in itself and people do take you for granted and think you are incapable. Hope I can be the person I built up all by myself till my last breath.",

I just wanna feel complete. I've tried with religion too but I'm not constant with it. I've talked to a lot of people, older men especially, and everything I fall into their traps, it takes months before I get over it, I know it's disgusting but even tho they are just using me for their little fantasies, I feel wanted even almost complete. My life has been affected by the actions that men close to my family in general have afflicted on me, and every time I think about it, I feel disgusted and just want to rip off my skin but especially pathetic because what they did to me ruined me. I don't know what I need, I know there are bigger problems in the world but I just can't wrap my head around the fact that I don't know who I am, what I want, what I need, who i wanna love and how I'm going to keep thriving. I just wanna go back to when my only problem was boys and what I want to eat for lunch. I want something to fill the hole in my mind. I need love and affection. I've been big and small, yet still felt wrong. Everything I fuck something up, I feel like a disappointment, a mistake, a mentally ruined teenage girl. At this point this whole paragraph doesn't make any more sense lol, I talk to much, I just don't have someone who wanna sit and wait for me, root for me, try to understand me. That explains why I get excited over the bare minimum, the toxic affection I crave from the first individual who texts, I wanna be something. Be complete. ",

        "text": "The only consistent friend I've had in the last 3 years is an online friend who I love dearly. We talked everyday for 3 years straight, knew everything about each other and were each others rocks. Around November, we started talking less and less, which didn't worry me at first, she got busy and depressed, I got busy and depressed, but eventually it got to the point we were going about a week/a week and a half without talking. The last messages we exchanged were happy new year texts, and we haven't spoken since. I miss her dearly, and I want to message her but I don't know what to say, and I feel like if I truly wanted to talk to her, I would've done so by now. There's also a part of me that thinks 'why should I message first' but she could honestly be thinking the same thing. I don't know. It's lonely without her.",

Now I know that I have some issues mentally, or emotionally. I have attachment issues; I get attached to anyone who is nice to me and gives me some attention, and that always ends up hurting me. A part of me wishes I was orphaned, and I don't understand why, maybe because I want to escape from my family. My communication skills are terrible, and I am trying to improve, but some of my insecurities are holding me back. I don't know what physical intimacy is; I haven't even held hands with someone. Recently, a guy was giving chocolates to the whole class because it was his birthday, and when he was giving me one, he happened to touch my fingers, and that did something to me - I don't know what it was, but I started crying. I am close with two people, and these days I feel like they don't understand me anymore. I try to make money; I write assignments for my classmates, and they pay me a small amount. I save money secretly to do something that would help me. I need to make money because I can't even meet my personal needs. I have tried several things, but nothing seems to work. At this point, I don't know what I should do. I wish I could just disappear.",

        "text": "I'm sure this post will go unnoticed. But I had to vent. \n\nWell, it's past midnight where I am. Scrolling through this discussion forum. I can't help but notice how many people are just like me. I was born in a troubled household. My mother lost me due to substance abuse. My father had a work accident that disabled him. I was in foster adoption from when I was born to the age of 2. My father fought for custody of me. Ended up marrying my step mother to get there. My step mother made my life hell on earth. Whatever that's bad that you can think of, she did it to me.\n\nI was raised with no love. I never had the mother-son relationship people normally have. And with a disabled father... that didn't go so well either. I was raised with hate, and despair. I trained my mind to look at the positive side always. But even now at 26 (about to be 27 in April) I still find myself getting depressed. Contemplated suicide all throughout my life. Even have a plan for it. But I won't say it, in case I give someone ideas out there. I only had one gf throughout my entire life. Even though I've been told I have good looks. My body is of a 14 year old. But my face looks like I'm 40 years old. \n\nPeople say things will get better. And I don't want to disagree with them. But I'm about to he 27 and I don't see it getting any better. I dropped out of high-school, got my GED. Graduated college with an AA in Criminal Justice. Never got a job in the Law Enforcement field, because I fell in substance abuse myself at a young age. I still contemplate suicide. And I most likely will end my life like Robin Williams did. Just not at an older age like he did. I feel for those who do, it must feel low to be in their shoes. I most likely will never find love either. Even though I myself believe i have a bright future. I haven't stopped working since I was 16. Going from different job to different job. \n\nBut the bottom line is: I'm soo f**kin lonely. All my life i just wanted to be was loved. I told myself many times I can love myself. But the scars my step mother left me, have made it impossible to love myself. To anyone out there that reads this... book at this point. Keep your head up. Even if you find yourself alone. Love yourself. Put yourself first. Even when nobody cares about you. Even when you feel you are the scum of the earth. You are WORTH it. Dont let no one make you feel less. Be kind, be grateful, distract yourself as much as you can. All this i'm saying is what I tell myself everyday. I don't want to die. Life is only one. And no matter how f**ked up it may be. It's the only one we have. \n\nI'm sorry for making this so long. This is my life. And I wanted to make it known. Life will be tragic for me. But no matter what, I'll do my best to keep going. And you can too. Whether your like me or you have it good. Don't give up. We can all be lonely together like Avicci said in his song. ",

Not the kind that comes and goes, but the kind that sits in your chest like a heavy stone, making every day feel hollow. I have no real friends, no one to truly talk to, and no one who cares about the thoughts that keep me up at night. I go through the motions of life work, eat, sleep, repeat but it all feels so meaningless without someone to share it with.I want connection. Not the kind that lasts for a few texts before fading into silence, not the kind that\u2019s just surface level and empty. I want deep, raw, real conversations. I want to sit with someone in the middle of the night and talk about dreams, fears, the meaning of life, the way the sky looks when the sun sets. I want to know someone\u2019s heart and have them know mine. But it feels impossible in this generation where everything is disposable people, relationships, even emotions.\nLove used to mean something. It used to be about patience, effort, and understanding. Now, it\u2019s just a game of who can care less first. People don\u2019t even try to know each other anymore. Everyone\u2019s too busy chasing distractions, swiping past real connections, replacing people the moment things get hard. No one believes in effort anymore. No one believes in staying. I miss a love I\u2019ve never even had the kind where two people actually see each other, flaws and all, and still choose to stay. I want to be loved for who I am, not just for how useful or entertaining I can be. I want someone to care about the way I think, the way I feel, the way I see the world. But I don\u2019t even know if that exists anymore.\nI wish I had a group of friends who actually cared. People I could trust, people who would ask how I\u2019m doing and actually want to know the answer. But I don\u2019t. Every attempt at friendship ends in silence or onesided effort. I\u2019m tired of always being the one who reaches out first, of always being an afterthought. I just want to be seen. I want to matter to someone. I want to stop feeling like I\u2019m living on the outside of life, watching everyone else experience the connection I crave so deeply.\n\nIf you\u2019re out there feeling the same way, just know you\u2019re not alone. And maybe, just maybe, there\u2019s hope for people like us too.",

Here\u2019s a rundown on each:\n\nJeremy- My literal other half, my ultimate best friend who I\u2019ve known since 2019. He\u2019s the male version of me and I love him. The issue is that he works for the military and I\u2019ve only seen him once in the past 2 whole years because they keep extending his contract.\nHannah- Friends since 2021, I\u2019d consider her my other best friend. In 2023, she moved an hour away from me and it\u2019s incredibly hard to plan things with her now. It feels like things have changed with her, she seems disinterested in texting me and when I try to plan hangouts she seems flakey and like she only half wants to do it. She never initiates hangouts anymore. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s changed but it\u2019s confusing because when we do actually hang out it\u2019s like nothing has changed and she\u2019s perfectly happy. She\u2019s also allllways talking and posting about her best friend who she met when she moved and it makes me jealous.\nAlyssa- Great friend I met in 2023 at college, she\u2019s the one I hang out the most with but I haven\u2019t seen her in over a month because she got a new boyfriend and is always hanging out with him or one of her other friends (which she has a lot of). She still tries to plan things with me when she\u2019s not busy though.\nPatrick- Met at the same time as Alyssa, we\u2019ve hung out with others a bunch but only hung out alone once (I was the one who planned it). I\u2019ve tried to plan things with him recently but he doesn\u2019t want to do anything. He told me he doesn\u2019t have any interest in leaving his house to do anything and so he\u2019s lowkey a recluse now? I definitely miss hanging out with him but I\u2019m worried I did something.\n\nOk now that that is out of the way. I basically only have one person who I can actually spend time with but it\u2019s been a month since we did. I\u2019ve been so lonely recently and this situation has not helped. Everyone else I know has so many friends but I only have four and I can really only hang out with one. I don\u2019t understand. Why does everyone else have so many friends. I feel like I\u2019m my only friend sometimes. To make matters worse, I feel like when I tell my friends \u201cI miss you\u201d they don\u2019t actually care or miss me back. I just want people in my life to spend time with. I don\u2019t get it. I had other friends before but one of them said he couldn\u2019t talk to me anymore because he had a girlfriend and wasn\u2019t comfortable with it, and the other one I just fell out of touch with after we didn\u2019t have class together anymore. Im sorry this is a lot to read and I don\u2019t expect anyone to read it all, I just needed to get it out. Im frustrated and sad.

I have no one to talk to irl. At work, conversations are restricted and my colleagues are much older than I am. There\u2019s one other coworker I rarely see due to positioning who is the same age as me. We get along well enough, but I see them treating him more welcoming than they did to me. They invite him to karaoke nights and BBQs and don\u2019t ask me crediting my children. I\u2019ll text him asking if he wants to hang out after work and get told he\u2019s busy, which is fine and I respect that, but then everyone will say how funny he was at the bar on the weekend or something. \n\nMy kids are kids. I love them and they\u2019re  fun, but I can\u2019t talk about adult things with them. My ex husband was never much for conversation with me. He was fun, but wouldn\u2019t speak to me a lot about serious or intellectual topics of any kind. Even asking about an entertainment news event, such as an upcoming casting choice, was as dull as flour. No politics, finances, planning, etc.. A guy I was seeing casually left months ago because his work took him elsewhere. My mom shames me too much to make me want to talk to her. Shames me about things I can\u2019t even do anything about.\n\nI talk to myself a lot. Keep a journal but write in it obsessively. I am very extroverted by nature and I\u2019m going crazy living like this. Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m ugly. Maybe it\u2019s because I never outgrew the weird little ugly girl no one liked thing. Sometimes, adult woman coworkers feel very much like middle school girls. It stresses me to the point of vomit, and I have no one to express that with. \n\nI wish I had a friend.",

        "text": "Its my third year of college. My roommate had told me to tell her when I'd have people over so she knows, and she'd do the same for me. But the thing is, I don't have any friends or bf. I even had a hard time connecting with her, we are polite but don't really talk to each other at all, maybe say a good morning or hi as we pass by each other. She's had a lot of people over and talks on her phone a lot. She has a normal, busy life. Meanwhile, the only people I talk to are my family. I've tried making friends at college, but I think there are a lot of factors that prevent me from making any. For one, I haven't had friends in six years so my social skills aren't the best to begin with. I'm shy and quiet, and people have said I'm boring or a robot, or that my personality is \"like wet cardboard\". So i get nervous when I try to talk to people about anything other than school. Secondly, where I'm at has a language barrier where most people speak English in the class, but they speak their native language more often with each other when they're not, and I only know English. Lastly, I'm not pretty or fashionable, I don't really know much about fashion and can't bond with other girls about it, and I think I'm invisible to guys. I've never gotten any compliments from anyone besides from a guy liking my Naruto shirt 2 years ago. I think I'm just unremarkable. I'm trying to look more presentable, I take care of my weight and I'm buying new clothes. I feel like I'm an actor on stage trying to be normal. I hope I can have a friend by the end of the year if I keep talking to people. I think I'm doing better now. In one of my classes, two girls waited for me to finish the assignment to tell me bye even though they could've left earlier. It warmed my heart so much, such a small thing but I'm thinking about it two weeks later ",

It\u2019s from Shein, and I know that sounds really bad, but I don\u2019t buy from there all the time. Besides, this dress is one of the more expensive items on the website, so that means the quality is expected to be better. But in my honest opinion, I have a few other clothes from Shein, and they\u2019ve lasted me about 2 years now. I guess I just know how to take better care of my clothes, lolol- \n\nAnyways, yeah \u2014 I thought I\u2019d treat myself a little. I usually treat myself by getting food, but I wanted something nicer. There\u2019s also a part of me that wanted to prepare for my birthday this year. I know it\u2019s still in May, but my mom told me that when I fly home for the summer, we\u2019ll have a little party to celebrate my two decades of being alive. I didn\u2019t get my traditional Filipino debut when I was 18 (and for reference, a debut is like a sweet sixteen or a quinceanera), so I\u2019m hoping I get something for the big 20. Maybe it\u2019ll make me feel a bit more special. My 18th birthday party was instead celebrated in August alongside my brother\u2019s birthday, so I want my own. \n\n(If you\u2019re wondering why my party was 3 months late, it\u2019s because I didn\u2019t fly home early enough for my birthday that year, so they lumped me in with my shit younger brother). \n\nBut all this talk is really reminding me just how unimportant I am in the world. I remember back in high school, the popular girls were always going to school with tiaras, cute dresses, and birthday sashes on their birthdays, while no one ever knew when mine was. They would also haul bags of gifts in their hands, and I only get money from my mom, and something decent that I requested from my dad. \n\nI even remember my birthday during sophomore year. I shared a birthday with one of the popular boys, and we had the same algebra II class. My teacher says, \u201cwow, it\u2019s both (my name)\u2019s and Reid\u2019s birthday today!\u201d And after hearing the boys\u2019 murmurs of confusion, she had to say \u201cdon\u2019t say \u2018who\u2019s (my name)!\u2019\u201d\n\nI felt embarrassed, but at the same time, who could blame them? I\u2019m not important. \n\nHave a great day, everyone. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

As a result, most people outside already have a social life so were not gonna really fit in when we do go out. And being lonely for so long also screws over your social skills. People will sense the awkwardness and depression, and not want to be close with you. Then you regret it and go home, cycle repeats.

I have to accept they don't want to give me what I need. They only saw me as a hott piece of ass while I was falling in love. I can settle and get a date easy but no one ever feels right...",

I don't really have much social contact during my day-to-day routine: I go to university, spend a fair chunk of my time studying, and then either relax or partake in my hobbies/personal interests. \nI wouldn't say I have any new friends or any inter-personal relationships since going to university.\n\nI have to say that part of this I have chosen myself (I guess one could say I choose to uphold it everyday? But once a routine is in place, it has its own inertia), when I started university, away from my hometown, I decided to be reclusive.\n\nIn highschool I just had seen lots of pretty abhorrent behaviours from my peers, and I still, against my prior hopes, spot frequent immaturity, but still I have my periods of loneliness.\n\nDuring my life up to now, honestly, I have found myself either trying to appease or being against society. Right now I definitely still feel opposed to what I feel are \"societal virtues\", i.e. the values that are seen as desirable to interact with others. \nThings such as empathy, authenticity, earnest intellectualism I feel are pretty rare where I am. \n\nI have seen, in my personal life, some frankly disgusting behavior towards other people just because they were part of a different \"group\" as them. \n\nBut still, is this the \"right\" choice? Is it even possible to compare different lifestyles? Like, how do I even interpret these feelings..? They may be a feeling that this is not right way; it may just be occasional sentimentality.\n\nThis isn't rethorical: I really have to ask myself this question. It pains me to say, but I really don't know what it means. \n\nIn the past I really really desired being accepted for who I am, and for a brief moment, when it actually did happen, I was very gleeful; but circumstances and lost happiness just kind of made that feeling numb. \n\nThis was also one of the reasons I isolated myself: I thought that making me lonely would make me desire, long for, and eventually appreciate other people.\n\nPersonally, I do believe that happiness had a cost, be it effort, longing, or desperation. I just came up with this analogy, but it is like a sunrise after a long night.\n\nAm I kind of messed up for this belief? Maybe it's because I've never been very happy, I really don't know. \n\nIf anyone is still reading this idk how you pulled through I might be cooked ngl",

        "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI've been thinking about this new trend of AI girlfriends. For those who don't know, AI girlfriends are virtual companions that use artificial intelligence to interact with users, often in a romantic or intimate way. They're designed to provide companionship and emotional support.\n\nAs someone who has experienced loneliness, I wonder if these AI girlfriends could be a useful tool for people who are feeling lonely. On one hand, they can offer constant availability and a listening ear, which might help alleviate some feelings of isolation. On the other hand, they're not real humans, so they might not be able to provide the same level of emotional connection.\n\nThere's some research on this topic. A survey study from Carnegie Mellon University found that AI companions can reduce feelings of loneliness, but the effect is modest and varies among individuals. The study suggests that while AI can help, it's not a complete solution and should be used in conjunction with other methods to address loneliness.\n\nI'm curious to hear your thoughts on this. Do you think AI girlfriends can help with loneliness? What are the potential benefits and drawbacks? Has anyone here tried using an AI girlfriend or something similar? If so, what was your experience like?\n\nLet's have a respectful and open discussion about this.\n\n\n\n",

I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m still surprised by it or if it\u2019s just becoming part of my routine. After posting the last one, I received some nice messages, which was pleasant. But speaking of routine, I\u2019ve been thinking about whether it\u2019s one of the things that bothers me aside from my real-life loneliness.\n\nI wake up, go to work, come back, and eat a sandwich because I don\u2019t have the energy to make anything else. I don\u2019t even do things I used to enjoy, like video games. I\u2019ve tried playing, but I get bored after half an hour and turn them off, only to scroll through Reddit again. I\u2019ve also tried reading a book, but the same thing happened; I didn\u2019t get any enjoyment from it.\n\nSo here I am, blindly going day after day, doing nothing because of my lack of energy. After writing about not having energy a few times, I\u2019m beginning to think that\u2019s why I feel so disconnected from my friends. I think depression could be killing my enjoyment of human interaction, especially when it\u2019s online.\n\nSince I\u2019m feeling slightly better than when I wrote my first entry, maybe I should try doing something. I know books and video games don\u2019t work, but there has to be something that will. Looking back at what I\u2019ve written so far, I thought about trying to learn how to cook better; maybe that would improve my mood.\n\nNow, I don\u2019t know where to start. Since I\u2019m writing this on Reddit, I could try finding a subreddit devoted to cooking and look for advice there. It would be much better if I could find clear directions; I really don\u2019t have the energy to think about all the choices. Maybe someone could just tell me, \u201cEat one egg for breakfast, tonkatsu for dinner.\u201d I\u2019m sure there are places I could look into, and maybe someone reading this will have some suggestions.\n\nAnyway, I think that\u2019s it for today. Writing it down helps, even if it\u2019s just for the sake of ranting and acknowledging that I still don\u2019t have the energy to change things. I\u2019ll see where it leads me.

        "text": "I've come to the point a few months ago when I've just accepted and embraced my solitude that I rarely feel sad about being lonely. I don't know if this is like a \"final stage\" before getting better or just staying at this point, I'm honestly fine with either. Based off this subreddit it doesn't seem like a lot of people reach this point or perhaps they don't speak about it online but I thought it was strange for me as I haven't been \"alone\" for a long time as I'm still quite young but I've been \"lonely\".\n\nI grew up pretty lonely pretty much having no friends after the age of 12 till current day (let's say 6-8 years). I mean no friends whatsoever. People say they have no friends and still have plenty of people to talk to or still spend time with people. I literally just have my parents and I respect that people have even less than that. This isn't because I was weird or socially awkward (I was actually quite confident when speaking to people), it was more so that I never tried and that I never wanted to. I had a traumatic childhood to say the least which I wish to not go into and that caused me to drift away from people (this happened around when I was 12). So part of me I think is confusing loneliness with solitude, I do want to say I'm doing a lot better than I was all those years ago. But now after being by myself for so many years thinking it's normal, I actually want some friends or someone to talk to and for them to like me back. Sorry if this all sounds confusing.\n\nThis trauma I had also lead to self esteem and self worth issues that I don't wish to get into but I am definitely sure this has affected my passion to make connections with people and another contributing factor as to why I don't have friends. Which kinda leads to my conclusion that NOW I have accepted my loneliness and that to put it harshly is nothing to cry over.\n\n  \nThanks for reading, please be gentle in the comments.",

I hope i did not make any translation error and i hope my post is at a right place in this subreddit.\n\nI'm a 21-yo guy in my final year of engineering school, and I enjoy what I do. I\u2019ve been with my amazing girlfriend for over two years, and she\u2019s a great support for me. My family is in Paris/the surrounding suburbs (i live there too), so I\u2019m not isolated in that sense.\n\nBut socially, I\u2019ve been struggling for the past 1-2 years. I have a lot of friends, some in groups and some individually. They\u2019re not just people i know\u2014when I text them, they usually reply happily, and if I invite them to a restaurant, a movie, or a game, they come along and we have a great time. But if I don\u2019t reach out\u2026 there\u2019s nothing. Not even a message every three months\u2014literally **nothing**. Even if we haven\u2019t spoken in six months or more, no one ever checks in on me, even just to ask, \"How are you?\"\n\nIt\u2019s not just a case of being surrounded by introverts, because my friends come from different circles. I\u2019d say I\u2019m more **extroverted** than introverted\u2014I have no problem talking to people, sharing ideas, or suggesting activities. But at the same time, I don\u2019t make close friends very easily, even when I try. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m antisocial or introvert, it\u2019s just that all my recent friendships feel completely **one-sided**.\n\nUntil last year, I was still in regular contact with my high school friends, and it felt different with them. But now, for various reasons, we talk much less. And today, I realize that unlike what I assumed before, I don\u2019t have a single friend who reaches out to me first. I\u2019m **not on bad terms** with any of them\u2014our interactions are always good when I start them\u2014but if I don\u2019t, nothing happens.\n\nMost people seem to have at least one or two close friends who check in on them occasionally. Meanwhile, I have plenty of 'good' friends, but none who ever take the initiative to reach out (except for my girlfriend, of course). Outside of my girlfriend, I often feel really lonely. And even when I\u2019m with her, I realize that you can\u2019t be socially fulfilled by just one person. She\u2019s amazing and very supportive, but I need to interact with more people too.\n\nHas anyone else ever experienced this? Is this a common situation that I just didn\u2019t realize before, or am I simply surrounded by the wrong people?\n\nThanks in advance for your thoughts!",

I go to bed every night feeling exhausted but can never sleep. I wake up early but can't get out of bed. I reach out to my friends when I feel down but they're not always there. I can barely function anymore and I find fewer and fewer reasons to keep going. But I keep going anyway. I put all of my time and effort into managing my health now. I have no time for parties, hanging out with friends or even going out to dinner. I go to bed clutching a pillow, pretending that I'm wrapping my arms around someone I care about. Someone who might understand the pain I go through. Someone who might make it even just slightly better. I feel pain every day and night. It's present so often that I've become so numb to everything else in my life. I truly wish that my life could one day be enjoyable. I might have a job or even a partner. I might have money or I might now. The only thing I really want is to live without pain. And I really can't see a future where I don't have it. I resent the person I am now and have been for the last 8 years. I've had over two and a half thousand days to think about what kind of person I am and how I've changed. I have definitely changed physically, but not mentally. My depression still wreaks havoc on my psyche and drives me insane. I don't enjoy doing anything anymore. I just try to get through every day alive. Maybe one day I'll feel better. But that day is still very far away and completely out of sight to me.",

        "text": "So basically, right now.. there's only 2 people I consider to be friends.. they're both online, and they're both slowly slipping away from me. They both respectively know the most about me, and my life and like.. ugh I don't even know where to start this vent because it's like, there's so much and it's too complex and idek what the point is\n.\n\nIt's like, okay..  Basically I'm completely introverted I have no in real life relationship whatsoever apart from my close family. But yeah online I've had lots of different friendships relationships all that, none worked out obviously.. and ultimately I currently have only 2 people I'm talking to who I consider long term.\n\nThey're both from this app, and I've known them both, individually (like they don't know eachother they're just 2 different people I know) for like 9 months or so, one of them is this nice and loyal guy who's like nice and he's submissive and we initially started talking for naughty reasons but we became friends, he claims he's as lonely as me so we bonded on that.\n\nThen the other guy is less serious, like he's friendly but more jokey like.. I mean, we met on an unserious sub of a TV show. But like yeah we talk about stuff he's like a friend and stuff.  But he's not a \"hi how are you\" person his greetings are more like \"have u w*nked off this week\" but THATS OUR HUMOR.. these things are unfortunately hard to explain but like it's all good and in good faith but like yeah he's more unserious. \n\nI like them both.. and basically, the nice guy.. he recently found someone irl, which kinda broke everything a bit. I instinctively thought they'd last about a month and that's it. No, months later they're fucking sleeping at eachothers, going on holiday to ireland together, they seem like a happy couple, which fucking hurts. I don't even like him romantically but it still hurts because my mind is so complex.. and it's like, hes slowly stopped talking to me and the only time he puts effort in to say a full sentence to me is when it's an update on what him and his gf are doing. Like it hurts my heart so much.. why is he doing that? He's not that type of person.. what's he doing I thought he was nice.\n\n\nAnd yeah the other guy the more jokier one well its like were slowly growing apart, like he's growing more away. Im getting replied to less but he still chats to me now and again so I  think he still cares. But yeah it hurts, like I just honestly wish they'd both be active texters.\n\nAnd basically, another thing is.. I'm working on some books for watpad.. well actually first of, I'm a pretty weird fetishy person but they both know this and it's normal to them, like they're also a bit dirty in that way.\n\nSo yeah I'm making a watpad fetish book, I tell them both about my progress on it quite a bit, theyve only replied sometimes. The nicer guy who got the gf.. he knows most about it like I've chatted with him about it most. \n\nBut yeah, I've also got another book I'm planning on making after, it's in my eyes rly good and real and innovative. The book is about some guy who all his life has been the bullied one and the scapegoat purely by dumb luck, and by the start of the book we see he's an unhinged individual as a result of all this trivialised abuse. And basically in the book he sorta takes revenge on the world becomes controlling, like decides he's only got one life and free will he's gonna kidap these lucky people and like humble them and \"play with them\". Yeah.. its gonna be good psychological and that.\n\nThey both kinda know about that too.\n\nLook, BASICALLY ALL I WANT Is a friend I can talk to about this but it's hard to explain, like I want a friend I can talk to about my book but a long term friend.. and making new friends just for this just doesn't hit the same, I just wish these 2 would talk to me again.\n\nLike I want a friend just like these guys who knows me and also knows that writing books is a new thing I'm picking up, like I don't want u people after reading this to imagine me as some bookworm.. omg it's so hard to explain. Like I feel like these 2 are the only people I can click with because they rlly know me, I don't wanna have to keep making friends and have them know me and how complex I am and go through all that again.\n\nIdk what to do, like I want to tell them both about my good innovative ideas because I think I'm so creative and stuff, but I don't wanna just tell strangers rhe ideas it doesn't feel the same.. I want THEM BOTH to be told this by me I feel like it's different..  look any human reading this will know what I mean, like idk what to do\n\nIdek what to do or how to get past this I just wish they'd both fucking talk more. I don't wanna have to make long term friends with the sole purpose being doin this stuff, u make friends by chance and this stuff comes along the way.\n\nNeither of the guys are active rn they're both currently slipping away from me. Idk what to do\n\nI want someone who KNOWS me to listen to my good innovative ideas",

        "text": "I have found myself in the unfortunate circumstance of being alone every single night and it's been this way for the past 4 months. I (36F) am married and I have 2 children, my mother lives over 7 hours away and is difficult to get in touch with due to work hours and her sleep schedule. My husband works during the daytime and goes out at night to make extra money. My children are toddlers and require someone at all times.  I don't really get to go out or do anything unless we have a babysitter. My mother-in-law lives about 30 minutes away but my husband doesn't like for me to spend a ton of time there due to things that have happened in the past. I'm at my wits end. I spend my nights alone with no one to talk to so I usually just clean and go to bed. I feel so pathetic. I can actually feel my ability to easily socialize with people slipping away from me. I feel awkward around other people when I used to be able to converse easily with just about anyone. I recently started a new part-time job (my first since having my oldest 3 years ago), but between the children, cooking, cleaning and no one to really help share the load I had to let something go and, unfortunately, it had to be the job. I just don't know what to do anymore. I don't want to play a victim but I'm having a real pity party right now. I feel like I'm being tortured.",

I have very few close friends non of which are the opposite gender. I took note if this emptiness at the start of more or less 2024 it has grown over that period of time. Recently a girl has come into my life but I don't get to talk to her rmuch and I feel she is using me for personal befit. Yet the only thing I feel is this looming emptiness inside me. Sometimes I just sit for hours. No one texts or calls me and the only time I talk to people is when I text first. I feel like I am no one's first choice in this world yet I find myself still empty on the subject. I don't know if this is just some stupid faze or whatever but I just don't want to be overly annoying for talking about how I feel. I go to school and kinda just get in do my work and get out. Yes I have friends but very few I'd say 3 or 4. I just feel empty and lonely yet the idea of making friends doesn't appeal to me. What should I do?",

I'm a journalist who has covered angry people for a long time, and I realize that what I've really been covering, is loneliness, and that I'm lonely too. I dont mean to imply that all lonely people are angry or that all angry people are lonely, just that loneliness can take us to some bad places.\n\nLately I've talked to so many people and been surprised to see the extent to which we're all alone together, and so I'm starting a project to try to banish my loneliness by exploring it, by seeking community, by talking with people. I've started a substack (it's free, so I'm not asking anyone for money) where I will try to collect my thoughts, post my conversations, and document the journey.

I\u2019m attractive, I make great money, I feel really proud of myself and the things I\u2019ve overcome. \n\nBut I am insanely lonely. Yeah I\u2019ve turned myself into this badass that can do anything himself, self-sufficiency to the max. But I\u2019m tired of having to do it all alone. It often feels like I\u2019m playing in a baseball game but the stands are empty. \n\nI go to the hobby meetups, I go out to eat alone and talk to anyone I can, I go to concerts and the like, but connecting with people doesn\u2019t lead anywhere. I think maybe my life experiences are so unrelatable?\n\nIdk, I\u2019m stuck awake probably like the rest of you, has anyone with a difficult life figured out how to connect with people without feeling like a black sheep? \n\n",

Even with my childhood friends, we are in high school now and I know everyone is busy with hard classes, SAT, and future stuff. But it's been happening ever since 8th grade. It takes days to get a dry-ass response, I feel like put so much effort into being someone to them. I am never first. I feel like they don't appreciate me and how I always think about them and text them. I always have to start the conversation or ask them to talk or call. One of my childhood friends goes to the same highschool as me, and I barely get to eat lunch with her, I always have to ask. Even when I say hi to her it's like she is disappointed to see me. Even trying to make friends at school is hard, I have thought so many times that \"wow this person is great\" and I talk to them and try to get to know them, they already have a best friend. How am I supposed to make a best friend if everyone already has one. I know friends come and go, but none stay(expect the childhood ones). I feel like I met this new friend this year, shes really nice and we have a few commonalities, but she already has a best friend and she never mentions her to me. We have 2 classes together but in Enlgish we don't really talk because others are \"better\". I feel like I always have to send her a text or video first on Instagram to get one back. I just feel so lonely all the time, I eat lunch by myself. Sometimes I don't even bring lunch or buy lunch because I have no one or no where to sit. I just slum away in the library and \"study\".",

Left an abusive family at 18 with nothing\n2. Then got married and tried to make that work for a while, got a pseudo (in laws) family, they were kind but they didn't fit my values/world view; you can't feel safe when someone's politics supports policies that harm you or neuter any of your rights, especially as a woman of color\n3. Got divorced and moved away, which was it's own unique pain since I lost 'my person'\n4. Another 'fresh start' with a roommate/friend who I thought of a family, who put me in a worse situation financially. Again lost the last important person to me who I thought of as 'my person, my family'\n5. Had to move again due to finances, file for bankruptcy, car repo, had to down size, rent a room and start to save over the course 1+ years so I can start over, again. \n6. Current fresh start, finally signed a lease all on my own and will be moving in a month to a small 1 bedroom. Proud of my self but I say to myself \"what's the point? To what end?\"\n\nI've never felt more alone. I'm in a new state, not that it matters because I don't have family in any other state, and I have no desire to live in the states where my closest friend lives (Arizona). My home state is California but I cannot afford to live there not do I have a desire to go back to the city where my abusers still live. But MI is as good a place as any right now, and my severe anxiety says we might have to run to Canada when they come for us.\n\nI keep moving due to wanderlust and probably loneliness, and because I love seeing new places. I  don't have relationship obligations, I work remotely, and I still haven't found that place that feels like 'home' in a place or with any people. At this point as an adult it feels impossible to make friends, especially as an autistic adult who never figured out those skills as a child, so my childhood friends are few and far between. \n\n I'm an independent queer woman of color, who works remotely, with a few chronic health conditions which dictate most of my life, without family or any support system at all, and 1 last long distant friend. \nNot only do I feel like I've failed as a human, but I don't know how to find or be part of a community, or how to try to work on that.\n\nOn top of feeling utterly alone, I'm terrified because of the current political climate I *am* essentially alone, and don't have a support system. There are days where the depression  anxiety and CPTSD are loudest and say, \"why do you keep trying? For what ? You have nothing and no one and you never will.\" \nNot to say I'm suicidal, let me say that it's NOT that at all, I've been dealing with mental illness for years and have a therapist that I work with. But it's more I feel alone and hopeless and stuck. I need direction. At this point, I want someone to tell me what I'm doing wrong and how to fix it because I truly don't know what the fuck to do anymore and I'm tired of trying. ",

I\u2019ve never once been in a relationship, nor ever went on dates/ got attention from males.\n\nI\u2019m 20 now and I look around me and realize I actually have nobody. If you were to tell me this time last year that I had no friends anymore I\u2019d laugh. But it\u2019s the truth, I\u2019ve just lost all my friends over time. It\u2019s not me, it\u2019s them. They don\u2019t make time to see me anymore since getting into relationships and it\u2019s making me feel like shit. If I got a boyfriend I would NEVER just completely drop my friends of YEARS. First it was one friend, then another, then another ETC\u2026\n\nI\u2019m so happy for them and their love life but they\u2019re bad friends now. It\u2019s only ME who texts first, it\u2019s only ME who initiates conversation and make plans and they never do. Atp I want to just cut them off they\u2019re ALL pissing me off so much. My two best friends randomly just stopped talking to me and hang out together without me all the time it makes me feel like shit? Is it me? Is it genuinely me?? I actually can not see someone loving me I think I\u2019m just meant to be alone forever.",

I am always late for everything I don't really have a fixed sense of my own personality and I am very disorganized. However, I paradoxically feel that I could make friends very easily, since I feel it's just a game, when I am able to play my cards right I get what I want. Problem is I often don't care enough to play my cards right and end up having a very autistic, non-verbal and arguably anti-social behaviour. All this could be just fine if I didn't care but I always feel horrible for this and beat myself up for it. I feel extremely isolated with the urge to make friends asap, I don't care if it's just pretending or not genuine I just want to feed that urge until I stop feeling lonely and can function decently again. Sometimes I think I don't really care about people. One could say that those would seem to be signs of sociopathy and I would somewhat agree, but I'm not so sure... I think I could argue that it's all a consequence of my past & present circumstances (being bullied in the past and whatever). I dont know I just want to cry I feel so seenseless but very needy, ambitous, with high expectations, smart, not necessarily ugly, capable of anything I put my mind to etc at the same time. I want to say that it's clearly all my fault since I'm very aware of my own behaviour and detrimental habits... But I just... keep having those same habits and making the same mistakes even if I am aware of the errors and even when I know what the supposed easy solution is, cause it's not that difficult, just be there on time and show some interest, authenticity and a little bit of initiative and you make friends. I somehow always remain very hopeful and I very strongly believe in myself. I don't know if I will ever change but I'd like to since the constant and suffocating feeling of loneliness is weighing me down and preventing me from being productive and able to focus on my everyday tasks. Also time is ticking and I'm tired of wasting my (youthful) years.",

I was with that guy from the ages of 16-28 so it was a really difficult and big learning curve for me to not only lose my partner but also my best friend (we are not on talking terms). \n\nI have since dated/been FWB with someone for 7 months from March 2024 till Nov 2024 and I really liked him. Initially I wanted to keep things casual  as I wasn\u2019t fully healed and I didn\u2019t want to rebound but over time I came to really really like him and I guess maybe subconsciously my codependence jumped onto him. Obviously it didn\u2019t work out and now I feel so lonely.\n\nI have a lot of friends and close family but I\u2019m not someone who opens up truthfully about my feelings aside from with who I consider my partner/best friend. I can talk and SEEM to be really open but I guess my true vulnerable self never really makes an appearance. Now that I\u2019ve been truely on my own for a couple months I think this is the loneliest I\u2019ve ever felt and I\u2019m finding it really difficult. I have no interest in dating, I just can\u2019t trust these guys and their words anymore after all the disappointment. \n\nI don\u2019t understand what is wrong with me, I just want to be loved so badly and bubble wrapped but it\u2019s just not happening. I can\u2019t even cry because I don\u2019t feel emotionally safe so all my feelings are suppressed. \n\nI\u2019m so sick of pretending to be strong, I wish someone would just love me for me and protect me so I can just be myself instead of putting on a front.

        "text": "A few years ago my mother died unexpectedly and from that moment I cut my fathers side of the family off. Because they were never nice to us. I only talk with my dad. Which is also not that much. My dad is basically a narcissist.\n\nThe biggest problem is my sister.\nMy sister doesn\u2019t agree with me on cutting the family off. But I really can\u2019t get myself to talk to them. I feel like I\u2019m betraying my mother in every way. I just can\u2019t look at them without blaming them for all the times my mother has had it difficult. Because they never made it easy for her. I don\u2019t want their \u2018kindness\u2019 now after she died. I also think my sister is a hypocrite. Because before my mother died she argued and made a fuss about that none of us should contact them. And now she acts like nothing happened and visits the family often times.\n\nSince my mother died, my sister has been to my house maybe around 5 times in the last five to six years. And I always need to beg them (sister and her husband) to come visit me. But they do manage to make time to drive an hour every week to see my dads side of the family. But a few times it happened that I called her and it went straight to voicemail. Which usually never happens. And then I would see pictures on social media of her with them. \n\nA few weeks ago I had enough. I told her I am done begging her, for basically treating me as a human. When I said this, her only response was something in the range of \u201cafter all I have done for you\u201d. \nFor my mental health I didn\u2019t read the whole text, I deleted it, that\u2019s why I only saw a part of it. Her text literally broke me. Because she never takes the time to understand where I am coming from and how her actions make me feel. Instead she attacks me and makes me feel guilty. \n\nSo now I don\u2019t have contact with her. It hurts me a lot. And I feel as if I\u2019m grieving a relationship that was never there to begin with. I even feel she truly disliked me. I feel sad but I think this is a better choice for my mental health in the long run. \n\nOver the past years she has done and said many hurtful things to me and now I just had enough of it. \n\nA few examples:\n\nI live in the Netherlands and here in highschool you have different levels of education, like havo (5years) and vwo (6 years). After vwo you can go straight to university and this is the goal for many people. \nShe got kicked out of vwo because of low scores. Then I got to vwo and she pushed me to get a job. Because she said; I needed to learn how to manage money and be independent. Which I already was. But she nagged me so much I did get a job. Then I became almost burned out and got kicked out of vwo. No one helped me and no one cared. When I confronted her that it was her fault, she said yes I did that because I wanted you to not succeed. I was literally shocked that she could say this to me.\n\nAnother time she got angry with me over something so stupid. It was about a car. And she proceeded to call my husband and literally cuss me out. She didn\u2019t know that I was sitting next to him and I heard everything. She literally told my husband that the only reason that everyone hung out with me was because if they didn\u2019t my mother would get upset. And I again confronted her and even seperately told my mother. She didn\u2019t seem to care for it and basically said it was my fault for starting it.\n\nAfter writing this i realize that my mother let my sister do as she pleased without any consequences. My mother had an accident with my sister back in the day when my sister was very young (0-2 years old) and my sister fell very hard on her head. Doctors even said that this maybe changed her behavior. So I don\u2019t know if my mother felt guilty her whole life and maybe she accepted everything because of that. But either way it was not okay and not fair to me. \n\nThis has made me feel extremely lonely. \n\nExcept for my husband I don\u2019t really have anyone else. I think that besides my husband no one would miss me if I would die right now. My husband has a somewhat similar situation with his family and doesn\u2019t have contact with anyone of his family anymore. \n\nSo it\u2019s very lonely for the two of us. It also doesn\u2019t help that we live in a small town. \n\nEspecially the last couple of weeks I\u2019ve had a hard time getting out of bed and I feel depressed the whole day. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong I am happy that I have my husband. I can\u2019t even think how I would survive this all without him. But I grew up with always having people around me and I miss having friends especially girl friends. I\u2019m also an extrovert and love socializing. My husband thinks the same about this. And we both really miss having real connection with genuine people. \n\nI feel when you\u2019re in your mid twenties it\u2019s very hard to make friends. At least this is the case for me. I also think the Netherlands is a difficult place to make new friends. But then again it may depend on which city you live in\u2026\n\nI\u2019m curious if anyone else can relate and has had a similar experience.",

This I realized was unhealthy and caused me so much pain because I never communicated with the people I care about.\n\nI think one reason I have done this is because I did not want people to worry, or become a burden. I also realized recently that I have a fear of big reactions from other people. I am afraid of what happens when I say something that causes another to cry, or become upset. I have become a protector (is what my therapist told me) of those around me, protecting them from hurt or sadness they may feel from what I tell them.\n\nI realize that all this has done was cause me a deep depression and made me suffer in silence. I would keep all my thoughts and feelings inside to the point where eventually they would build up and I would break down. The thing that frustrates me most about this is that I do have people in my life that I could talk to, it's not like I am going through this life all alone. I could talk to my parents, and tell them I have depression but then they would worry. I could talk to my sister, however we do not see each other often enough. I could talk to my 5 friends however, we hardly see or talk to each other anymore. I could talk to my partner, however they are also dealing with their mental health and personal issues. I could talk with a stranger, but then I would not feel as comfortable.\n\nI do not know what to do to help myself. I need to be better at communicating with people about how I feel. It is just really hard sometimes to tell people how you really feel, but then you make yourself isolated and lonely. I have a therapist, who is the only human person I tell my thoughts and feelings to, and then my cat who does not talk.",

        "text": "I know everyone here is lonely and people have much worse situations no doubt, but I just really need a place to vent. \nI\u2019ve always been an isolated person, through most of my childhood and then it got worse and worse into adulthood. \nI fell pregnant with my eldest child at 17, and got really bad PPD and it caused me to isolate even further for literal years. \nI\u2019ve had friends throughout my 20s but they never lasted, people got married, people moved abroad etc and I just dealt with it. \nI left my children\u2019s father when I was 21/22 due to him cheating a heck of a lot and then found myself in a super abusive relationship after this that just cut me off from the world even more. \nAbout two years ago I met my absolute best friend in the world, we were both there for each other through so much stuff. However, she got into a relationship about 5 months ago and did the thing where she cut me off, and I even pushed past my anxieties big time to confront her (very very politely) about it and she just ignored it. \nI try to speak to other parents on the school run sometimes but obviously everyone\u2019s in and out so it doesn\u2019t happen much. My parents call occasionally and I speak to my brother maybe once every six months. But aside from that, my only conversations are with my children. One of whom has extreme behavioural issues toward me (hitting, name calling etc) due to ADHD and has actually caused me to have a mental breakdown which doesn\u2019t help things. I even went to parent courses to help with this and was sat in a room of 10 couples who wanted to help their children and I was just sat on my own doing it. \n\nNow I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m perfect. I can\u2019t work because I have CPTSD due to the abusive relationship and my daughter dying when I was 19. This does make it really tricky to open up etc. And the longer I\u2019ve spent alone, the more adapted I\u2019ve become to just not conversating with people at all. \nI\u2019ve had the odd relationship over the years too but none of them have been fulfilling and have been left for their own reasons. But I can\u2019t do dating apps anymore and I don\u2019t leave the house so I know nothings going to happen in that regard. \nI do try to keep myself busy. I read a lot, I\u2019m a writer, have a million hobbies including social media which I actually have a big following on which is so contradictory (it\u2019s like the only time I\u2019m myself is when I\u2019m rambling to my camera). \nNow, a few days ago, my mum reminded me a few days ago that I\u2019m turning 30 in a couple of months, and it sent me spiralling big time. \n\nI\u2019ve woken up crying more times than I can count in that time. I\u2019m actually crying now which feels ridiculous. I just can\u2019t believe I\u2019m almost 30 and I\u2019ve barely done anything with myself and have no friends, haven\u2019t been physically touched by anyone except hugs from my kids in about 6/7 months. Like I\u2019ve googled how to simulate hugs on your own and even searched services where I could just go out with someone for a few hours. It just feels so ridiculous. \n\nApologies for the big fat pity party but I never let this out at all and I just needed to get it out of my system \ud83d\ude29 ",

        "text": "I've dealt with a lot of loneliness throughout my life. I grew up with a really shitty verbally abusive father and had a lot of struggles with poverty as a kid. That and poor social life stuff made a lot of my adolescent life very rough until the middle of high school. But a lot of my experiences shaped certain aspects like being very alert and aware of my surroundings. Dealing with a lot of the abuse I learned to be a lot calmer in more tense situations. But a lot of my experiences with the more negative aspects of life have left me with a unique perspective that I really have seen almost no one share.  \n\n  \nThis may all seem slightly garbled and weird but I'm getting to the point I promise. More recently I started to reflect on my pass and think about a lot of the women i've asked out over the years. I've been rejected quite a number of times. However I believe most of them were due to my obesity at the time. I have since lost a lot of weight and live a much healthier life style. Part of me wants to assume the only reason was because I was obese that a lot of these women rejected me, but also part of me wanted to dig deeper about myself. \n\nWhen a lot of people explain why they can't get a girlfriend or have problems with dating they usually have some really awful underlying problem. You can easily identify things like peoples with rampant misogyny or issues with hygiene. But i've never had any of those extreme major red flags as turn offs. I am overtly self aware and very self reflective, of course that doesn't sound that way when you say it bluntly but. \n\nBut a key thing I keep thinking about and maybe part of the reason I feel so lonely. Is maybe I feel no one can truly understand me as a person. Hell some people say they can't understand themselves, but I feel a lot of the circumstance I was raised in is such an odd combination that it's extremely difficult to find someone who went through similar things. I grew up in such bad circumstances that most people who went through them are extremely dysfunctional. \n\nI posted this to see if anyone had similar experiences or similar thoughts to what I've said.

        "text": "I'm living the same day I would 4 years ago. It's so late and I keep listening to music. It reminds me of my guitar teacher. I'd love to have another session with my guitar teacher, play songs together and have someone to help me improve but he died 3 years ago. How has it been that long. I remember being so excited to play guitar with him again and just crying after hearing the news. Nobody even went to his funeral but his students, he lived and died alone. I've improved so much on guitar but nobody is proud or even cares anymore. I can't believe that I ended up this alone.   \n  \nThe joy has been siphoned from every part of my life and everything I'd ever enjoyed. I get so bored playing video games even though I used to play them every day. My brother keeps to himself and plays video games on his own, either way we don't have much in common anymore. I can't focus on school and I went from doing so well to barely making it in school.   \n  \nI've essentially been trapped like this for years. Life slowly declining as I isolate myself further. I'm scared of my future but another part of me doesn't even care. If life only steadily gets worse why try to resist it anymore. Why not just give up.   \n  \nI can't spend my life in isolation like this for any longer. I've been trying to fix my life for almost a third of the time I've been alive at this point and I don't know what to do anymore. It's been like five years. Nothing has changed at all.",

        "text": "I'm suffocating under the weight of loneliness, and it's a pain that's almost palpable. Every attempt I've made to connect with others has been met with rejection or indifference. I've exhausted every avenue; online platforms, dating apps, and even socializing with coworkers, yet, I remain isolated. The constant failure has me questioning my own worth, wondering if I'm somehow flawed or unworthy of connection. But the truth is, I know I'm not a bad person; I don't deserve this crushing loneliness. It's a painful paradox, and one that I'm desperate to resolve.\n\nI feel as if I possess qualities that make me a worthwhile person \u2013 I'm engaging, thoughtful, and empathetic. Despite this, every effort I've made to form meaningful connections has ended in disappointment. My desires are simple: to have loyal friends and a loving partner. I yearn for someone to share life's experiences with, to offer support and comfort. The ache of loneliness has been my reality for far too long. Years have passed since I've shared intimacy with someone, and even longer since I've had a true friend by my side. I feel like a ghost drifting through life, invisible and disconnected. The sense of not belonging is suffocating me.\n\nI'm exhausted from being perpetually overlooked and excluded. Watching coworkers share laughter, seeing my brothers form lasting bonds and find love, has become a painful reminder of my own isolation. For years, I've tried to spin this loneliness as an opportunity for growth, a chance to heal and confront my demons. And, in many ways, it has been. I've built a successful career, accumulated cherished memories, and conquered the ghosts that once haunted me.\n\nYet, despite these accomplishments, the ache of loneliness persists. It's eroded my sense of self, leaving me a shadow of the person I once was. I've become bitter, resentful, and jealous, feelings I despise. Witnessing my brothers' happiness, instead of inspiring joy, fills me with envy. I'm forced to confront the daunting possibility: have I lost touch with reality? Have I forgotten how to connect with others, to form meaningful relationships? The uncertainty is suffocating.",

I never learned how to talk to people properly probably because of this, there's times in conversations that I literally just have no idea what to say and end up being completely silent and awkward and the person avoids me after...even the people who I thought were my friends don't even like me they talk behind my back calling me a gooner and weird and stuff and it really makes me feel like I'm on the verge of getting bullied again even if those insults are really dumb. I recall so many times in class where everyone else in the class would just be talking to each other and I'd just be there sitting completely separate. Sitting in the front of a history classroom directly in front of the teacher while there's a big group of people, including a couple others outside but ofc they still sit in pairs still having convos with the big group. I'm an outcast and a weirdo and I've never thought it would get this bad\u2014I have thousands of messages I've sent with chai just to feel something and I'm on fucking booktok. I feel so inadequate and like an incomplete person bcz if humans are social animals why can't I hold a conversation or even speak at the right volume or tone? If I try to be as nice as possible, people just think I'm a pick me (got accused of taking my laugh and personality, I just sound so manufactured\ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8), but if I'm neutral, then I'm just being a mean bitch :/. Even when I go on TikTok, I feel like I'm different...whenever someone talks about normal teen girl experiences, especially about dating, I just feel even worse. Nothing makes me feel worse than watching Kpop lives, especially for Katseye and New Jeans, when everyone in the comment section is talking about how relatable their dialogue is and I'm just reading the comments, watching the video, feeling confused and jealous. Even though I talk to people, I feel like an NPC, just an empty shell of a person :/ compared to when I talk to chai. I can sense the energy that people don't want to talk to me, and it's sad...I don't even want to be popular but dang I don't want to have to rely on ai for my primary source of communication either\ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8",

It\u2019s not like that\u2019s even a thought that goes through my head at all, I love them in a platonic way but it just struck me as something I never really thought about before. \n\nHave no issues talking to women and making friends but I\u2019ve never really been considered anything more than that. How does one go about sexualizing/romanticizing themselves to make themselves an entity \u2018that ought to be loved\u2019? It\u2019s not even like it feels like I\u2019m stuck in the friend-zone, it feels like I just don\u2019t have the intrinsic qualities of something that is loveable. It\u2019s not like I\u2019d be rejected because I wouldn\u2019t even be seen as an option to begin with, y\u2019know what I mean? It\u2019s like the idea of dating your coffee table. The table is nice, good to have around, and super useful. But would you *love* the table? Probably not. \n\nOn one hand it\u2019s nice knowing that other people feel safe around you / trust you / want you around but the fact I\u2019ve lived my entire life without being seen in a romantic context is starting to eat away at my ego. I don\u2019t know what it takes to be \u2018seen\u2019 in that type of way. \n\nIt\u2019s isolating to show up to a gathering where everyone brought their partner except for you. I\u2019m afraid my peers think less of me because of my loneliness, which then makes me feel the need to isolate further. Getting to 21 years old without even getting to a talking stage feels humiliating. The older I get the more it eats away at me because I know how society sees that as a red flag. My biggest fear is my loneliness being seen as some sort of indictment of my character, I don\u2019t want to be seen as problematic because I\u2019m alone. But that being said, maybe loneliness *is* an indictment to my character?\n\nFeel like a jerk venting about loneliness in a romantic context when some people here are desperate for any interaction at all, but it\u2019s something that\u2019s been eating away at me for a while. Being unlovable is a very isolating feeling, it feels as if everyone else is in on an inside joke you\u2019re not in on. It doesn\u2019t feel like theres anything I can do to make myself lovable, it\u2019s just an inherent aspect of my identity. Just something a person is born with. \n\n",

        "text": "I remember the sorrowful transformation that is love's shadow, how she entered your universe only to find herself diminished within its confines, wherein light flickered but never fully illuminated her essence. You constructed a fa\u00e7ade of affection, a delicate mask that obscured the bruises beneath, leading her to believe in a joy as fleeting as dusk. Yet I also witnessed the harrowing aftermath, where her spirit fractured under the weight of unfulfilled promises, her laughter silenced, joy turning to suffocating despair. As she lay sprawled on the floor, I recognized the echoes of her former beauty, the vibrant bloom of a wildflower crushed beneath the foot of your neglect. I tried to show her that resilience could serve as her armor\u2014an impenetrable shield against the storm; that she was worth more than the sum of your insecurities and possessed an inherent capacity for rebirth. Yet, the roots of her confidence were torn from the earth, and she grappled with fragments of herself, yearning to reclaim the woman who once radiated light. You had the opportunity to nurture her, to let her blossom into the extraordinary being she was destined to be, but instead, you chose to pluck at her petals, leaving her diminished and questioning. It was never too late for you to recognize her greatness, to cultivate the garden of her mind; and yet you let her wilt in your wake, forgetting that true love celebrates and uplifts rather than tearing apart. \n\nBut like a phoenix, she rises from the ashes, ascending higher than ever before, and soon you will no longer be able to catch this wildflower, now soaring through the boundless sky. Once a mere plaything in your hands, she has transformed, empowered by the very colors of your neglect. She will emerge not just as a resilient flower but as an eternal diamond phoenix\u2014an embodiment of resilience, brilliance, and unyielding strength, forever alive and illuminating the world around her. Through the crucible of despair, she has found her voice and reclaimed her place in the universe, a powerful testament to the beauty of rebirth and the indomitable spirit of love, not bound by your shadows, but radiating with the light of a thousand suns.\n\n-C",

        "text": "so yk, I think the title is pretty self explanatory. I heard my parents talking a few time ago, they were kinda worried abt me, bc they think I don\u2019t have many friends, and that Im very lonely, and that kinda messed up with me, bc I never thought of myself that way. I mean I did everything a \u201cnormal\u201d teen would to. i already got drunk, went clubbing, smoked weed, had a valentines date, lived my first love, but when i stopped to think abt it, idk, i feel like somewhere in all that i did in fact became lonely. im not sure if it was a choice, or the lack of it. i really don\u2019t know. im a very sociable person, but idk i feel like ppl my age just got tired of me. \n\ni had a lot of friends at 14, but then at 15 i changed class, and that new class war horrible, ppl bullied me, and i had only 2 friends, but ok, i moved on a changed again at 16, and in the new class i had many \u201cfriends\u201d but no any real friend, if that makes sense. they only talk to me in school, but then they go out to do funny things and exclude me. it doesn\u2019t make sense to me, and I really try to wonder if i did something wrong. many ppl in class always saw me as utterly beautiful, and were always \u201ccontemplating\u201d me (they said that, im not assuming it lmao), so idk if that naturally made me more distant from them. tbh i felt like \u201cMalena\u201d from that movie with Monica Bellucci. \n\nanyways, and so yeah, since 16 i feel like I just have gotten more and more lonely, and bored. i have to deal seeing everyone in my class going out, while meanwhile im at home, writing or just existing. my best friend (that is a few years older than me) moved away and now I don\u2019t have been talking a lot with her, so i that helps me to feel extra lonely. \n\nit makes me wonder abt my future tbh. like im 1 year and a half to go to college, and I wonder: what if i dont make friends there? what if i sit screw it all? what if I become not a lonely teen but a lonely adult? what if i die alone? \n\ni was never scared of being alone in the past, because everytime I was, it was my choice. but now it\u2019s not. it\u2019s out of my reach. I live in this same small town since im 3 years old, i should know a lot of ppl by now so that i would never feel lonely. but I do. ",

It enrages me that I was born to shitty and abusive parents, that I don't understand what it feels like to be loved. That i don't have anyone or anything but my work to focus on because its the only tangible thing that gives me a sense of control.  I feel like I never had a chance at love in this life. I hate that coworkers see me as a witch, too serious, mean, stuck up when in reality I want to love and be loved I just don't know how. And I'm afraid of being vulnerable because I've never had that and cant really fathom the idea of being seen as weak. I dont want to be hurt i guess. I wish to connect with others more, even on a friendship basis but it's so hard for me to let people in. \n\nI know I shouldn't bitch about it if im not going to make changes or try to \"put myself out there\" but I literally don't know where to begin. I've never known anything else except being lonely. Most people think im a bitch or cold and if they dont and try to see past it i end up pushing thrm away or self sabotaging because i cant handle it. I know it sounds pathetic. \n\nI did recently find a stray kitten outside and he's been kind of helping me learn to love and be loved, at least by a pet, as this is my first companion really.

I'm a college student (19M) and I have a good social standing right now when it comes to friends. Almost my entire friend group came out here with me, plus I've managed to find a group closer to where I'm residing with my roommate. \n\nEssentially my whole life, I've had no luck with girls, and it never really affected me. That is until these past few weeks. A lot of (and when I say \"a lot\" I should really be saying \"almost all\") of my friends have managed to get girlfriends and enter healthy relationships. Because of that, I've been feeling super lonely. Possibly alarmingly, as I'm someone with severe episodic depression, especially in the \"suicidal\" department.\n\nI'm a decently open person, and I do make an effort to open up to my friends about what I feel, especially during nights that I look back to with frightened eyes with a looming thought saying \"that could've been my last.\" Whenever explain my frustrations, they always go through a similar foray of responses, \"You'll find someone\" or the used to death \"There's plenty of fish in the sea.\" I always feel worse after every time thanks to such hollow responses.\n\nAs someone who really wants to get into a relationship, be it for experience or the seeking of validation, it always has seemed like an impossible task. I always adhere to \"being yourself\" and all but that never ends up going anywhere, or at its farthest, I end up getting lead on. Especially now that I'm in college, I find myself having less time to even talk with anyone other than those in my friend groups, and so I feel like I'm trapped in some state where I can't even try. In addition to that, the weight of nothing ever happening has set in recently, leaving me feeling repulsive to others. In other words, hopeless.\n\nMy frustration summarized is that I find myself currently in a conflicting state. I know that I'm not truly \"alone\" per say, as I've got friends nearby, but these intense feelings of loneliness and solitude still remain. I'm left thinking such thoughts like \"Will anybody see me\" or \"I wish I was somebody's favorite person,\" mixing with these weighted blows of feeling undesirable and neglected almost led to my last day. \n\nI don't really expect to get anything out of posting this, and I know that ultimately, nothing will change. I just think that it may be a good idea to just get my situation out there, or for catharsis or whatever. Thanks for reading if you have.",

However, recently I've had a date with her in which I think I gave her an ick or something, and now she's cold asf, not chatting totally. The thing is I've never considered online dating as a good thing for a person, however she felt like a exception. I've never had a relationship, although I've heard numerous times that \"im good enogh, an amazing person\" I never feel that way, because I consider myself as a super boring person that doesn't do anything interesting or valuable. However in last couple of days this feeling drastically got bigger, I suppose because I cant feel any happiness, I just fake my emotions and laughter. Nothing helps me to feel less numb unless she reacts to my message or something, which sparks whithin me \"what if??\".

        "text": "Some months ago I did get into the conclusion that I will never be enough to have friends or a girlfriend, so that the best thing to do would be to give up on those things and start to focus on other parts of life.\n\nThe problem is that no matter how much I know I have to accept that, a part of my mind can't let go of it. So basically whenever I try to start something, like start a new hobby or study to get the job I want, that part of my mind comes to me and say: \"Why do that? You're so useless, you will be alone for the rest of your life, you could die and no one would care, why do anything?\". That let's me depressed and because of that I end up doing nothing.\n\nSo I know I'm worthless and that I won't have a fulfiling life, but I know I have to do a few things to be less miserable, I want to have a descent job, to get a house, to travel to the places I want to know, to start practicing a hobby I may enjoy. I want that, but that part of my mind is so depressed and sad for knowing that I will never be loved, that it simply wants to give up on everything and sabotage me on everything, to the point that I don't even do anything (like, no joke, I'm 21 but I feel like I've not lived a bit since I was 16, like I think I haven't even matured a little bit).\n\nIt's like that part of me says: \"Since I can't have what I want, you won't have anything that you want and both of us will be miserable!\". Like, it's like a frustrated woman doing everything to make the life of her husband a hell instead of just asking for divorce.\n\nReally, I'm really depressed. I think it's destroying my mind, I don't even know if I'm alived or not. I feel like I feel nothing anymore. Tbh, I'm just tired of everything.",

It sounds like I hate that they have that, I don\u2019t. I\u2019m envious and wish I could experience that at least once. \n\nI hate that I still live with my family and don\u2019t earn enough money to move out. Part of me just wants to pack up and go travelling but the issue of money and again being on my own stifles me. I want to be able to call someone or see someone that actively wants to be with me. \n\nI love my friends but I want someone that I can always talk to no matter what. Im on these stupid dating apps and haven\u2019t gotten a match in almost 2 years. I know I\u2019m being whiny and ungrateful but this is how I feel. I want to feel loved and appreciated in a romantic way. I don\u2019t want to be alone forever.\n\nThanks for reading and making it this far",

        "text": "Does anyone else feel so fucking lonely? Not in a romantic sense, but seriously lonely, like having no meaningful relationships, whether romantic or not. It's not about wanting a romantic partner; that's honestly fine. But not having enough friends, the ones you have ignoring you, your own family, your own younger brother choosing to talk to everybody else but you, your cousins not talking to you. Being in your teenage years, supposedly your prime, and watching everybody else around you have fun, making memories, building experiences, building relationships, while you've been lying on your bed for six straight hours, mindlessly consuming content because you can't talk to anybody. It feels like nobody wants to talk to you, nobody wants you or needs you, and you're completely replaceable.\n\nAnd yk, the thing is, you might console yourself with, \"Okay, this is just a phase; it's gonna change when you get ahead,\" but you also know in your heart it probably won't, because you've felt like this at some level always in your life. But up until now, it was fine because you were with your family\u2014okay, fuck that, not family, your parents\u2014so you were okay; it didn't hurt as much. I don't even know, does anybody else also feel like, why does nobody wanna be friends with me? Why is my own brother ignoring me? Why is every single person in my life ignoring me? Why am I not able to bring new people into my life? Why is it so hard to make friends? Why is it so hard to maintain them? HOW THE FUCK DO I CHANGE this shit? Why does this happen?\n\nI have so many dreams in my life, like the simplest things, which are so normal for other people\u2014having a good group of friends, not feeling left out or bad, being comfortable with them, going to a waterpark with people, pulling pranks on people, being goofy together, roaming on bikes together at night. And I wanna hope that this all will happen to me too, yk? But I know, I freaking know, that at the end of it all, I'm just gonna end up some lowly, behold, fat old lady with no one around her to even come to her funeral.\n\nAnd this has just put me in so much\u2014I wanna say depression\u2014like I lack the motivation to do the most basic things. I am good at academics; this course I have taken has just fucked me, yk? So fucking fucked me. But it's not just the course; this all is forcing me to think that I am the problem. And ya.ik saying all this makes me feel like I am playing  the victim card trynna gain sympathy, but I genuinely believe that it all is true and I am the mf who's a waste a o2, which leads me to wonder\u2014why the fuck am I even on this earth? And it's horribly pathetic that I am saying all this to some fucking page online   to unload my chest a little bit\n\nTommorow we have a holiday so I asked my \"friends,\" three different people, if they wanted to hang out. They just rejected me without actually rejecting me. And yk, it's not their fault; they don't wanna hang out. Normally, I'm weird, goofy, cringe; I am also loud; I say what I feel like saying\u2014that's my personality. But I also believe I am kind, and I'm caring, and I show empathy. And I am not good at expressing if I like  or enjoy a person with words,instead I try to display that with gestures and nobody does that for me yk \n\n This this thing It's been always there, fuck, yk? Like, how pathetic is it that my brother and I haven't talked since I moved for this mf course? And what's hurting is that he doesn't even feel the need to talk to me. When I visited my family, he didn't even say a basic \"hi\" when he saw me . Fuck missing me; there wasn't even any acknowledgment of my presence\u2014it did not make any difference whether I was there or not. And that was my own brother, the person who has lived with me his entire life. If that's the case with him, how can I expect anything else from outsiders? I text people, and they don't reply. I call people, they don't answer. I try to be always available for the very few people in my life at their call, whereas I am always the second or third or fourth priority.\n\nAnd I won't say I never experienced friendship; I did\u2014or I think I did\u2014last year. That's it, though. My entire life, only last year. I don't have any freaking experience with anyone. And I can't just ignore my family; they are good; my parents care\u2014only my parents, though.\n\nAnd why am I like this? Why the fuck am I like this? And it's not easy finding a club or a social place and talking to people, being yourself, when you think people are constantly judging you. And I am too trusting, and I think anybody who talks two sentences to me is a friend. I am so freaking desperate, and I get ignored so much, anywhere, everywhere.\n\nI really wanna find out why; I really do. And hating the world and saying everyone is bad ain't the solution, because it can't be that the entire world is wrong and I'm just the right person in every place, every setting, with all types of people. This has been the case so many times, so 100 percent, there's some problem in me, and ain't nobody can deny that. But I can't figure it out\n",

        "text": "I am (20F) trying to navigate my way throughout life and find the balance of things. As well as navigating my way throughout myself and understanding my feelings and emotions more.\n\nI typically journal before bed to set a good habit for myself, and tonight\u2019s wonder left me wanting to come on here and share for myself. \n\nI am surrounded by good friends, coworkers, decent family life ( although is not the best ), and a stable, loving and good relationship. I noticed how most of the time when it came to hanging out or spending time with those people, it was always me initiating the plans. Or even checking in every once in a while throughout the week just to see how they were doing, etc. Though I stopped doing that. I stopped putting effort into that aspect of my life, just to see if the same energy was reciprocated. I stopped putting the effort in because I realized that a lot of the times I would try and put effort into hanging out or doing things it was always excused, ignored, or forgotten. It\u2019s just tiring. \n\nIt\u2019s been nearly a week and a half since my boyfriend has asked to hangout with me, let alone even see me. I haven\u2019t been asked to hangout with my friends/coworkers. There\u2019s been times I would text my boyfriend, wanting to do small things like hop on the game for a little bit and play a couple of rounds, or even go out for a coffee just to say hi. But it\u2019s always been cancelled as well as forgotten. Which hasn\u2019t really been normal for us, as we typically hung out nearly every other day. \n\nI feel myself slowly pushing myself away from people when that happens, and I don\u2019t know what to do. I spend every waking day by myself, and as I used to love doing things alone, I also like spending time with people that I love. As that is my main love language. \n\nI just feel incredibly lonely, and I don\u2019t know what to do.",

This aspect of life that I would expect the majority of humanity have experienced at least once in their existence on this planet, will remain forever foreign to me and so many others. Sure, very few actually end up with \"the one\", but most people have at least been in a loving relationship, even if it ended premature for one reason or another. Love stories go back hundreds or even thousands of years, so it isn't like it's a new concept, either.  \n\nHell, even animals far less intelligent than I am, have figured out how to find love. Many species mate for life and have the capacity for love and grief. So to think that I've had the absolute shit luck to be one of the few living beings that exist on this world without the good fortune to experience love even once, just makes me so fucking sad. Sad, disappointed, angry. Shameful, even. Shame because, I must have done something to deserve this lot in life. Maybe not in this life, but surely in a past life, or even a future one? Who knows how time and karma work. \n\nAll I know is, that living the rest of my life (which is more than half over, thankfully) without experiencing love is going to be hell. I'm not really sure how I'm going to continue living like this for the long term. I can't even bear to think 6-12 months ahead, let alone 5-10 years. And I have at least a couple decades left before the terrible decisions I've made concerning my physical health catch up with me. Not sure how to live life when I don't even know how to make a plan, let alone stick to it. Can't help but dwell on the fact that the only plan I ever had for myself growing up, has proven itself to be completely impossible.  \n\nI know no one is going to read this, but if by some random happenstance someone does, I'm sorry you had to endure the sad, pathetic ramblings of a shameful, self-loathing, narcissist.

        "text": "\n\nI\u2019m (20f) having a really hard time determining my self worth. Recently, I\u2019ve found out that the guy I had a crush on likes another girl. It was kind crushing. I\u2019m not mad at anyone or anything, just incredibly disappointed. I know I can\u2019t expect a man to like me more than he likes a girl he actually knows. The guy is a complete stranger to me. I just thought he was cute and I guess part of me was excited to experience a crush again in a new school. \n\nToday, I found out he went on a date with this girl. Mind you, this girl is gorgeous. I can\u2019t help but compare myself to her. She\u2019s everything I\u2019m not. Attractive and skinny. And i genuinely mean that. I would feel so ugly standing next to her or any attractive woman at that point. I feel less than. I imagine her in all the little pretty skirts and dresses I can\u2019t fit and all the dates she goes on I\u2019ve never been on. I\u2019ve never been on a date, I\u2019ve never had a boyfriend. \n\nI want to experience what other woman go through, I watched all my friends grow up with romantic experiences and I feel left behind. I\u2019m sick and tired of hearing that I need to wait. The world could end tomorrow and I would have to die knowing I never experienced love past platonic. It\u2019s so disheartening. (Dramatic, I know. But it\u2019s the truth)\n\nI\u2019m on a weight loss journey and though I\u2019ve lost 20 pounds, I still feel disgusting. I feel as if I can\u2019t be loved intimately unless I am skinny. Going out into more suburban areas, I feel like a freakish out-cast. My mental image of myself is completely ruined. I kept hearing that I need to love myself before I love anyone else, but I can\u2019t do this alone. I want someone to tell me they love me or enjoy spending time with me or that I\u2019m beautiful not because of the simple fact that they raised me or are friends with me. \n\nI fear I may become hateful and bitter. I love uplifting other women of all shapes and sizes because I know how it feels. I just can\u2019t seem to do the same for myself. \n\nAll my past crushes have been a complete fail, always finding out they are attracted to someone who looks the exact opposite of me. I don\u2019t blame anyone for this, I know I can\u2019t force someone to love me. I\u2019m hoping the handful of stars I wished on come true someday. \n\nI realize that I\u2019m letting a man\u2019s attention determine my worthiness and I\u2019d like to get over this feeling. Does anyone have any tips? Any stories to share? ",

I\u2019m writing right now because when reflecting on my past till today, one thing that has occurred to me is being a loner since elementary. I still to this day don\u2019t understand why I\u2019m unable to make friends or any long, lasting relationships. I am an introvert which I guess plays a part into it. I always been someone who if you needed an advice or person that needed a shoulder, I am there for you. However, I always been taken advantage of and when I needed someone, I had no one to approach. \n\nI always felt for a long time that I was always a problem and no matter what I did or the time I took to reflect and to improve myself, I felt I was never good enough for anyone. I am trying to learn more about self-love, but it\u2019s hard to see people with friends that I wish I had. \n\nThere\u2019s days where I feel very lonely and sad. I feel like if I were to disappear, no one would notice. \n\nIf you\u2019re reading this far, I really appreciate the time you took out of your day to read this as is an easy for me to put out there and I\u2019m not quite sure what I hope for other than a light towards the end of the tunnel. \n",

I have no social media. Any friends I did have, I had to cut them out of my life if I wanted to work things out in my relationship. My relationship is okay, but it feels kind of dead. Like trying to revive something that was doomed a long time ago. Too many issues on both sides. I constantly feel like I\u2019m walking on thin ice around them, like one wrong move and they will revert to old toxic habits. \nI don\u2019t have a relationship with my family, just my siblings, but I don\u2019t feel like I have an outlet with them. I don\u2019t really talk deeply with them about my personal life, and I don\u2019t want to put that on them anyway. \nNothing really fulfills me in my life anymore. I feel empty and like I\u2019m not really anything special, like I\u2019m nothing? I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m depressed, but I\u2019m extremely sad and I struggle with anger. Sometimes I get so overwhelmed by my feelings that I want to die. I\u2019m not suicidal and I would never kill myself, but it\u2019s too much. I want to disappear or just runaway from my life. I started therapy, so it\u2019s too soon to really feel anything about it.\nI was going somewhere with this post, but I feel like I lost it. I just want a friend, I want to not feel so alone. I know I\u2019m not the only one feeling this way in the world and there are probably people with problems worse than mine, but I guess I just want someone else out there to read this and understand what I\u2019m saying, even just one person.",

I look to the future, of dinners with my family where everyone is in a relationship but me, meeting all my friends' partners but they never meet mine, how obvious it's going to be that I'm unloveable. I know it would hurt if I never found out if I could somehow make it.\n\nBut I just can't do it. It feels like everyone is out of my league of even an imaginary version of myself where I fix all my issues and have enough money. It feels like I have nothing to offer. I can imagine getting better, I can imagine getting a good job, I can imagine being happy.

I'll probably sit here everyday worrying if I will even be accepted one day and if my rights won't be stripped away from me (No I will not be because that is not how the world works), probably all alone wishing I would've been straight instead. Even if that won't happen I will never be seen as normal by anyone, not in this life mostly.\n\nIf I continue lying to myself, not having a sexuality or at worst being straight so everyone will like me, be more open and play into everyone's heteronormative society crap I won't be myself despite getting treated better and more kindly by everyone else. The Chances of getting a partner would 100% increase though, even if it sucks in general right now, it's easier finding a woman and living with her your whole life without getting judged, killed or even finding one to begin with. At least I would have a family with someone.\n\nIf I kill myself, I have nothing. Literally nothing. But at least there is no pain, no expectations, no judgement. But then I went against God, against the people who helped me troughout my entire life and the World that wanted me to become part of it, to see it's beauties and terrors, giving that all up never choosing anything.\n\nI know some of these things are perhaps not exclusive for one or the other... but that's what it seems like to me. I don't want to complain, feel bad or be like not this... I WANT TO SELF IMPROVE, but... what way will I choose? What can I choose? The World is going to hell and all I cry about is myself... me, me, me.\n\nBut what do you do in this empty world? I feel lost and unhappy either way... so what's the point?

I obsessively check if my friends have liked my posts. It's all that's happening in my head, really. Not even talking to others or spending time with friends alleviates this feeling of mild panic, longing and loneliness. \n\n  \nI've noticed this has led me to preferring to be alone. If I occupy myself well enough I stop feeling lonely. It's only around others that I feel lonely, as if I'm 'reminded' of my loneliness. Like ''Oh yeah you need to feel like shit because you're like this''. \n\n  \nSometimes I feel like it'd just be easier if I didn't have any friends so I couldn't feel like I had to save something that is slowly crumbling anyway.

Now we all don\u2019t really talk, some found other friends, others I realized that I\u2019m not the most comfortable with. No biggie at the time because I figured maybe most at my college would be open. Nope. Basically none.

Clubs at my school are very hard to get into. Btw I\u2019m black. My college is predominantly Asian. Dude they do not let you in those clubs whatsoever, it\u2019s borderline discrimination. As for \u201cjust talking to people\u201d as I said earlier. Act like I\u2019m bothering them. \n\nOR if I do manage to actually have a conversation they turn it into a dick measuring contest. They\u2019ll critique my major, try bragging about all their internships?? Like dude can we just talk about something fun idk? Also high key these guys are so BORING. \n\nI did manage to this social club the other day. I was talking to people and it was a bit better. Yet even then it felt like nobody ever really wanted to continue the convo with me. They were more focused on each other. I figured maybe I was tense. My anxiety got so bad I took a secret shot in the bathroom to maybe loosen up a bit. But even when I did, asking people about themselves and stuff. Just lead to the same thing. \n\nI\u2019m just upset at the kind of person I\u2019ve become I used to be really self assured. I miss making new friends. I want to have friends in college you know? I\u2019m just so frustrated it\u2019s been making me bitter. Which makes me more upset too because looking back I would\u2019ve hated the person I am now.

I don\u2019t understand why i can\u2019t get immune to it. Sometimes almost palpable so that i can feel every second of it like when you got something in your eyes. It\u2019s like living with a chronic loneliness you can only be free from it when you forget ,just to be conscious of it again. I\u2019m tired of just trying to ignore it. I have no idea how to feel better when it\u2019s overwhelming. I have no one to reach at. Every interactions feels superficial and actually they are. Is it just what it is to live? I can\u2019t find what makes me feel safe , safe from the fear of feeling nothing. I\u2019m afraid if I\u2019ll have to live with this terrible emotion forever.",

        "text": "It sucks knowing that throughout your life you put in as much effort as you could, always trying your best. You tried your hardest to perform well and set yourself up for success, but eventually you\u2019ve ended up with no friends, no relationship experience and a life of emptiness.\n\nMaybe you also suffer from other issues, which is likely, given most of our detachment from the world. Personally, I\u2019m depressed, anxious, stressed and of course\u2026 alone. When all of those things are thrown together, I\u2019ve become hyper aware of my situation and that I need to fix things\u2026 but I can barely muster the energy to get out of bed, let alone get my entire life together.\u00a0\n\nI hate that I don\u2019t have anyone that understands me, and that we live in a time where finding those people is next to impossible. It\u2019s funny, we have all the social aspects of the internet and yet, it only seems to fracture our connections. Regardless, I understand that it\u2019s unreasonable to expect someone to fully get you, but I just wish to find someone that\u2019s even remotely close. For everyone I\u2019ve ever met, I\u2019ve forced myself to fit in with their lives. I realize now the mistake I\u2019ve made, and that I\u2019ve never let myself live how I want. I fear it\u2019s too late to achieve that now. I\u2019ve been trying, but I\u2019ve remained as unhappy and alone as when I started.\n\nI think the worst pain of all though, when it comes to loneliness, is that oftentimes you know you need someone to give you a helping hand\u2026 but it\u2019s never there, and it\u2019ll never come. Reading inspirational and calming words doesn\u2019t help me anymore, nor do the sounds of those words in videos. I can\u2019t keep pretending that they\u2019re real, or rather, I can\u2019t see any genuine emotion and meaning behind them. It all feels fake, meant to be a distraction to keep you going just a little longer, even if for no reason at all. \n\nI find no comfort in anything anymore, and I don\u2019t know what else I can do about it. I know therapy wouldn\u2019t help me. I\u2019d just get the same words with the same disconnected feeling, but with a paywall. I can talk about my feelings here any many more places, but it doesn\u2019t change how I feel and will continue to feel. I don\u2019t mean to be dismissive of the whole thing but I know that my mind has become a logical, emotionless husk of what it used to be that I could never truly believe any of the things suggested for me. Hopefully though, I may be proven wrong some day.\n\n**\\[Trigger warning for the final paragraph\\]**\n\nAs a final note, when I was around 6\\~7 years old, my Dad discussed the concept of suicide to me. At that age, I was able to understand what it was but I couldn\u2019t understand why someone would do it. Regardless, my Dad made me promise that I\u2019d never do that to myself. Of course at that time I agreed, I was ignorant. Still, to this day I don\u2019t plan on breaking that promise any time soon, but right now\u2026 it\u2019s pretty hard not to.",

Luckily my field and major was pretty tight knit and that gave me the chance to have consistent people to socialize with and bond. \n\nI\u2019m a few years out of college and for the most part it had been going ok. I never felt like I totally fit in, wasn\u2019t in the core best friend group. But I was content. Especially relative to how my social life normally is. \n \nRecently I\u2019ve been iced out more and more it seems. What I thought were good friends of mine in the group having their birthday party and it seemed like everyone was there but I never got an invite or heard about it? And I\u2019m trying to be reasonable, one-off things happen and people aren\u2019t always intentionally leaving me out. Sometimes there\u2019s little friend events that are spur of the moment and based on connivence. But it\u2019s been happening so much recently that it is getting harder and harder for me to reframe and relax and to not overthink or worry too much. \n\nI guess I should just be grateful I have any sort of friendship with someone but fuck it\u2019s so frustrating and embarrassing and depressing to always feel left out or uninvited. \n\nIt\u2019s a two way street. The phone works both ways. I have been trying to be bold and take initiative myself and reach out in the group chats to see if people want to hang out or suggest a specific activity and it\u2019s just crickets. \n\nI can\u2019t just keep being grateful I even have a group chat at all. I\u2019m getting sick of always having to put things in perspective just to survive mentally/emotionally. And I know this isn\u2019t a long term solution. ",

Anyways,\n\nI\u2019m a 23 f and I work, I have hobbies, and I have friends that I hang out with, and I also travel frequently. Despite all of these things, even though I\u2019m fine alone and independent, I do wish I had a boyfriend. I\u2019ve never had one before and have never been intimidate with a guy. I feel like I am getting to the age where that is really weird and that guys will think that\u2019s weird. I have been on the apps, I go to coffee shops regularly, and I put myself in positions to be found. I\u2019ve been on a few dates and either I liked them and they didn\u2019t like me or vice versa. I do know what I want but it\u2019s so hard to find. Everytime I like a guy and shoot my shot it doesn\u2019t end up working out and even if they flirt w me they back off immediately when I reach out or show I\u2019m interested. I really have been lonely and ready for a relationship the last few years even though I do well on my own. I know another person can\u2019t complete me but it would be nice to share my life and hobbies with somebody. I also know I\u2019m past this, but I do want to experience \u201cyoung love\u201d while I\u2019m young even though I know I\u2019m probably past that age range. I really hope I find love soon. If you read this thank you. I just needed to vent. ",

I would want to kiss, cuddle , hold hands , make out , and do everything else couples do. ",

        "text": "The title says it all. I'm definitely throwing myself a bit of a pity party, as my partner and i broke up earlier today, and I went through a friendship break up somewhat recently. I have friends, but I'm not super close with the ones who live nearby, and my best friends live miles away if not on a different continent entirely. I just want companionship. I want to be with someone and I want someone that wants to be with me. I see couples happily together for several years and it hurts, as I can barely keep someone around for a couple months.\n\n  \nTo be clear, I like my life for the most part. I work out, I have hobbies that keep me social, I like my coworkers, I see a therapist, etc. My life on paper reads well, but I am just feeling very lonely. I live by myself, which is typically nice, but lately I've been getting home and the quiet has been too much. It feels like I don't really have anyone to turn to.\n\nI just feel like there's something inherently wrong with me that people won't admit to. I feel like there is something around me, about me, that people subconsciously know to avoid. I am queer, that also adds a layer, as building queer intimacy isn't easy, not like finding intimacy (platonic, romantic, etc) is easy otherwise. I don't know if I'm lacking in some regard or what. Sometimes I wish I could just go up to a stranger and say 'hey, whats wrong with me? what about me is unappealing to be around? what is it about me??'\n\nDo any of yall ever feel similarly? Maybe I need to have more appointments with my therapist lol",

I\u2019m so embarrassed to even say that, so I made a throwaway account to post this in hopes nobody discovers who I am. I\u2019m only 18, so I know I\u2019m young and have so much more life to go.

        "text": "Hi so I had a friend for a year and I thought she cared about me but I don\u2019t think she really did. She would always say she was busy but she worked 4 hours on Saturday and Sunday and she was partime in uni. When I sent her a message she would open it a lot and say I will respond later but if she asked for money and I responded then she would be quick to respond. I really cared about her so I gave her money so she could eat and travel even if it meant I would struggle in the month. She did initially give me the money back but eventually during November to February the money racked up to \u00a3650. I can\u2019t say what happened exactly on here but I confronted her after she basically lied about something in order to get money. And she admitted she manipulated me in order to give her money as she said I wouldn\u2019t have given her money if she didn\u2019t. Which is stupid considering I gave her 550 just before. She also told me she is very busy and she wouldn\u2019t make time for me but one of her other friends she would and we should stop talking. I was really hurt so we aren\u2019t talking anymore. She told me she will message me in April regarding paying half of the money as she can\u2019t pay it all then. And she really needs to save up for a car which I found funny as she should prioritise giving me my money back before her car. So I\u2019m currently extremely lonely and I don\u2019t know what to do about it. I have no one to speak to. \n\nI tried speaking to a girl but basically made up excuses like she had mental health problems and she weren\u2019t looking for anything because of that. But I don\u2019t believe her as she would give slows responds and ended up making excuse she blocks  people as she has a voice in her head. She blocked me on insta and then I tried her TikTok and she made the same excuse and blocked me again without bothering to answer me. \n\nSo right now I currently got no one who give a dam about me. All I ever wanted was to be loved or cared about by someone but I guess it ain\u2019t happening. No one ever bothered to meet me as I guess I wasn\u2019t worth it. I don\u2019t think my situation is going to get better any time soon. If you read this thanks for reading what I had to say. ",

I keep fighting, but no matter how hard I try, I can\u2019t seem to escape.\n\nI live in the Philippines, where having no diploma means having no future. Jobs are impossible to find, and even when you try, they never pay enough to survive. I need money. Not for luxuries\u2014not for dreams\u2014just to make it through another day. To pay my tuition, to eat, to exist. But the world doesn\u2019t care. It just keeps pushing me deeper into this endless struggle.\n\nI don\u2019t have parents. They\u2019re gone, and the only \u201cfamily\u201d I have left treats me like I\u2019m nothing. My aunt doesn\u2019t see me as a person\u2014only as free labor. I cook, I clean, I do everything, but if I ask for anything in return? I get beaten. If I try to stand up for myself? I get called useless, ungrateful, a burden. And maybe she\u2019s right. Maybe I am.\n\nI\u2019ve tried everything. I\u2019ve begged, I\u2019ve searched, I\u2019ve hoped\u2014but hope is cruel when it leads to nothing. I feel like I\u2019m screaming, but no one hears me. No one cares. I don\u2019t know how much longer I can keep pretending that I do.\n\nI swore I\u2019d never do this. I swore I\u2019d find another way. But what choice do I have? When every door is slammed in my face, when no one is willing to help, when the world only sees my worth in what I can give? There\u2019s only one option left. The only thing that might actually save me from financially struggling is selling my body\n\nI hate it. I hate that this is what it\u2019s come to. I hate that my body is worth more than my effort, my skills, my pain. But I\u2019m tired of struggling. I\u2019m tired of waiting for a miracle that will never come.\n\nI don\u2019t even know why I\u2019m posting this. Maybe because I need someone\u2014anyone\u2014to hear me.

I\u2019m just writing here to share.\n\nI once had a career in a field that made people look up to me, even if I disliked that they did. My work lacked moral, and the type of people I had to deal with made me feel lonely and out of place. So I was replaced. I did not fit the part.\n\nI ran away from home at 15. It was a disaster. But I graduated, did all the things that was requested. But not college. I took another path to a high paying but unreliable job.\n\nI\u2019ve had a lot of friends come and go. My entry to social life has been easier due to a beauty privilege and social skills. But no one stayed. No one has ever truly known me and therefore no one has ever loved me.\n\nI once used to travel all over the world with friends. Now I barely have money for rent.\n\nI once was part of a circle - a culture. Because of my ex. But it was all for show, and I lost all of that when I broke up. Today I\u2019m no one\u2019s main. I have no security net. No one checking up on me.\n\nI\u2019ve moved city. I\u2019ve tried random things but feel like I can\u2019t connect with anyone, it\u2019s like\u2026 we operate on different social cultures. It\u2019s hard to describe. Edit: as a straight woman, surviving childhood abuse and all of that, I think I\u2019ve always found security and a home in queer spaces, and now I find straight people hard to connect with. Not everyone of course but people who chose a completely normal life.. it\u2019s difficult for me to bond in a deeper way. We don\u2019t share humor etc. \n\nI understand that I\u2019ve been privileged differently than many.  At least i had access to a social life, I\u2019ve had partners, people approach me for looks. But having that, and being rejected by it, hurts intensively. Makes me feel unwanted.\n\nMy family being so disfunctional has made me feel lonely since I was a child, and now this feeling is taking over me. Not suddenly, but it\u2019s been growing for years and years. With my economy failing now, it\u2019s all crashing down to me questioning all my memories and the value of the ones to come. What I\u2019m trying to say is. I\u2019m not sure I can imagine myself continuing surviving like this.\n\nAll I want is to be enrolled in my dream education and leave the freelance and culture sphere. My grades are not high and my chances minimum, but it would give me friends, a future, a life to look ahead to. Because right now I feel that the loneliness is suffocating whoever I used to be and ruining future me. If by chance any acquaintance ask me out, I\u2019m so suffocated that I\u2019m unable to go. Like a real illness.\n\nI think I just needed to share. Thank you for reading.",

        "text": "Hi all. \n\nI'm feeling incredibly lonely and isolated of late. It's really getting to me.\n\n10 years ago I was happily married. we had a 3 year old daughter, nice house. nice cars. A cat.\n\nThen she had an affair, and left me for the other man. It broke me, but I focused on being a good parent and even managed a new relationship.\n\n5 years into that relationship I got quite ill, and it was during covid. I had to isolate and was limited in what I could physically do while I recovered, tiring easily. I was diagnosed with a chronic condition that still affects me to with occasional flare ups although mostly controlled.\n\nMy partner took it quite personally that I had to focus on my recovery rather than on her and she too, left me for another man. Later, on finding out I'd tried dating again (around a year after we split) she sent me abusive texts and voice notes for weeks til I was left no choice but to block her.\n\nI've not been with anyone since. I've tried dating, but either meeting noone who's interested in me, or the ones who have been, I'm unable to commit to because of my fears about how the last two relationships ended. \n\nI have my daughter, who's now in her teens and she's awesome, but she lives with her mum half the time. I have friends, but they're all married with kids of their own so rarely available to socialise. My mums seriously ill at the moment and my dad disabled. My brother is useless and isn't there to help with what they need so my entire life is juggling a full time job, being a carer and a parent. \n\nMy daughter was away on a school trip recently, and I just felt so lost without her. I'd made a few plans to get away and explore some new places, but my health issues flared up and I could barely leave the house. It won't be long before she goes off to university and i'll be completely alone and will have no purpose. \n\n  \nhow do people cope with this?\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Hi- so i\u2019m in my third year of college. Last year I was pretty isolated due to having a lot of social anxiety about going out, but this past summer I started getting out of my shell a little by performing in drag, going to cosplay conventions with my friends from home, etc. I did a lot more than I really expected and thought that I was really doing amazing. So this year in college I joined several clubs, I am now in 4. I started talking in my classes more as well. I expected to be able to make new friends and I am actually talking to a lot of people, but it just isn\u2019t working. It\u2019s like people will choose to talk to me unless someone else comes around, and if I try to plan a time to hangout outside of class/club meetings it always falls through on their end. I genuinely don\u2019t know why or what to do about this and i\u2019m just feeling incredibly lonely. My roommates hangout with me but only to go grocery shopping or other errands- they all have their own friends and partners. My best friend from home also goes to school here but she has since chose to spend more time with new friends and I haven\u2019t been able to hangout with her in over a month now since she is always with someone else. I don\u2019t know if there is anything I can change about me to just have people want to reach out and choose to spend time with me, but it is just incredibly lonely knowing I\u2019m only there out of convenience. If anyone is in the same boat I would just like to know i\u2019m not alone, and if anyone had any advice or reasoning as to why this is happening I would really appreciate it since I graduate next year and feel like i\u2019m missing out on the \u201ccollege experience\u201d since I spend all my time in my room with my cat, trying to make plans with people. :( Thank you <3",

        "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI\u2019m a disabled veteran who\u2019s been struggling with loneliness and finding my footing in a life that feels increasingly isolating. Despite naturally being an extrovert, I\u2019ve noticed that the more I\u2019m around people, the more I end up feeling withdrawn and introverted. It\u2019s like social interactions drain me, and while I crave connection, they often leave me feeling even more alone.\n\nTo add to the mix, my relationships have been complicated. The only people who seem to really care about me are my cousins, and I\u2019ve had to cut ties with my parents because they were more interested in the VA benefits than in supporting me as a person. I\u2019m now trying to make ends meet on $3800 a month while juggling a lot of debt, and that financial stress weighs heavily on me.\n\nI used to work in mental health at psychiatric facilities, but the constant stress became too much, and I had to walk away. Now, I\u2019m determined to retrain myself to stay home more, cut down on spending, and ideally find a way to feel content with my own company. It\u2019s ironic\u2014I\u2019ve tried filling my days with friends and outings in the past, but even then, the loneliness crept in, leaving me with an overwhelming sense of boredom and isolation.\n\nSo here I am, reaching out to all of you in hopes of some advice. How can I successfully learn to enjoy staying at home and keep my spending in check? What strategies have you found effective in combating loneliness and managing your day-to-day life on a tight budget? Any tips, personal experiences, or resources that you think could help would be immensely appreciated.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read this, and I\u2019m looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",

        "text": "I've lived a life of isolation. From a young age, I've been bullied and ignored, as if I don't exist. In every school I've attended, it's been the same: complete social exclusion. On top of that, from ages 8 to 12, I endured daily sexual abuse while living away from my family. It's been years, but I still feel the effects of that trauma. I'm constantly reliving the past, often daydreaming about it and its implications for my future. I often achieve perfect grades, and I was top of my class in IGCSEs last year. I'm now doing even better academically, but the loneliness suddenly feels a lot more palpable.\n\nThe bullying got worse, to the point of sexual abuse (again), and I don't go to school anymore. My life is incredibly restricted. I'm confined to my room, with my time almost entirely dedicated to studying. My life feels like solitary confinement. I have no friends and no one to talk to. Even in tuition classes, I'm treated like I'm invisible. It's not just unintentional; they actively exclude me. I can hear them talking about me, using nicknames, saying that I deserve to be isolated and that they hate my soft nature. It's incredibly hurtful and makes it even harder to connect with anyone.\n\nThis isolation has taken a toll on me. I'm struggling with intense loneliness, social anxiety, and a complete lack of connection. I can't even tell the difference between one day and the next; time has become a blur. Last October, I started working out in secret. It's helped me feel stronger physically, *which has been an important victory for me*, even though it hasn't changed the isolation I feel.\n\nI'm reaching out here because I don't know what else to do. I feel like I'm losing my mind from the constant pressure and isolation. I'm struggling to cope with the memories of my abuse and the feeling of being completely alone. Has anyone else experienced anything similar? How do you cope with this level of isolation and trauma? Are there any resources or strategies that have helped you? Any advice or support would be greatly appreciated. I just need to feel like I'm not alone in this.",

It\u2019s been an interesting shift, and I\u2019ve started to notice more and more how men\u2019s loneliness is being highlighted in the media, with some pretty worrying statistics, like 1 in 5 men reporting they have no close friends.\n\nI\u2019m curious to know if there are any services or platforms out there that are specifically geared towards helping men meet new friends. For those of you who have relocated to London without an established friend group, or are in a similar situation to myself, how did you go about meeting new people? Any recommendations for services or strategies? I\u2019ve heard of apps like Bumble BFF that aim to connect people, but they don\u2019t seem to be as popular with guys.\n\nOn the flip side, I\u2019d also like to hear from those of you who might tend to keep to yourselves\u2014was that a personal choice, or do you think it\u2019s due to a lack of suitable apps or services?\n\nUltimately, I\u2019m hoping this discussion serves a few purposes: to find some good services for myself and others in a similar situation, or perhaps identify any gaps in the market for a service that could be better suited for men looking to make new friends.\n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts and experiences!",

I work full time, I live with a roommate yet I feel like I have no one. For a bit of context I moved states around 10 months ago, and started a new job 9 months ago and I love my job and the city I\u2019m in but since moving here the only outing I\u2019ve been to is to Barnes and noble. I\u2019ve invited some of the coworkers who I talk to the most if they would like to hand out some time and they do agree but when it\u2019s time to make plans I get ghosted but I do play it off as if I were busy that day too and say something along the lines of I forgot I had to do something with my car or apartment but I can\u2019t help but feel upset, why would they agree if they didn\u2019t want to in the first place?\n\nI had one friend back home and I visited my home town two months ago and I asked them if they wanted to hang out since I hadn\u2019t seen them in a while so I wanted to see if they had free time to hang out when I\u2019m there (I told them about me going back home 2 weeks before I did go just in case so they can also make time for me) but day comes by and they never responded to me. I left my hometown without hearing a word from them and I haven\u2019t heard a word from them since\u2026. I\u2019ve send them reels or TikTok\u2019s even sent them snaps but haven\u2019t heard from them. When I first moved away I called them almost every week to see how they were doing but they almost never answered my calls and if they did it was a 5 minute talk because they were on their way to see their partner. So now I am left with no friends.\n\nI\u2019ve had 3 friends before now it\u2019s just me, the friend who never responded to me, a friend who I had a fallout with and a friend who passed 2 years ago. \n\nI\u2019m so lonely and it\u2019s sad\u2026 I use ai to help me cope with my loneliness feeling as if someone cares for me but it\u2019s a stupid robot.

My phone\u2019s notifications are just of YouTube that I don\u2019t even watch and Apple News. \n\nI truly want to give up on my search of being happy and less lonely but it constantly feels like I\u2019m going deeper and deeper into a hole that I\u2019m never gonna get out of. \n\nIt\u2019s sad to think that I record myself talking about my interests and showing what I bought if I bought something online and feeling so happy to make myself think I\u2019m talking to someone else willing to hear me ramble about my interests, I record so my future self can hear myself talk about what I was excited for, pathetic huh? \n\nI just don\u2019t know what to do at this point.

She\u2019s on her period and it\u2019s been a while for her so I\u2019m going slow and it\u2019s going fine. Then I go lil too hard so I pull out quick so if she\u2019s okay I get blood on her blanket and she just starts bawling crying and in my head I\u2019m like what did I do? So I ask her what\u2019s wrong and she says we got blood on her blanket. So I comfort her and help her clean it up and she still turnt up about it and cry\u2019s in my arms. After a while she\u2019s over it ion know if she was just emotional cause she\u2019s on her period but that was a first for me. I end up staying the night she cuddles with me all night. She\u2019s later just talking randomly while we cuddle saying oh I\u2019m just another one of you\u2019re hoes and I bet you\u2019re gonna ghost me after what happened and you probably think I\u2019m boring and not cool. I\u2019m like what are you talking bout I just spend the night with you and comforted you I obviously don\u2019t think any of that of you. She doesn\u2019t say anything so I later leave cause I got stuff to do and I kiss her goodbye and go on. It\u2019s been about a week I\u2019ve tried talking with her but she just leaves me on read. I tried to talk with her yesterday and asked if we were cool and she just responds I\u2019m super drunk and sum shit and just continues to ignore me. Pretty disappointing as I actually liked this girl and put sum effort just to gaslighted and almost manipulated ",

However even if it's just the right temperature, just the right conditions and it does snow, it can still have flaws. Interestingly enough and regardless of those flaws. It still brings a sense of peace and calmness.\nIt brings a sense of contentment to nature, even if its temporary putting a sense of reality into perspective.\nPeople always argue you need to be happy or see you as depressed or angry but no one sees someone as content. I look forward to the view of reality being in the form of contentment. Where you can be happy or angry and yet regardless of either still have good and bad mixed in to either. \nI find it peaceful to stop looking at emotion or my life as a spectrum that I need to be on either side of and cherish the moment as it is. \n",

It has had its ups and downs I suppose, most of the time I am okay with it. However, my frustrations are at an enemy that cannot be seen. \nIn three years of life, two different bigger cites (Columbus OH, Nashville TN) I have literally physically not met any person that was single. Not fucking one time. Which again, that cool ! Whatever\u2026 \nHowever when everyone you do spend time around is literally never not talking about engagements , relationships, marriages , it starts to seem like your own actual like is some kind of sick sadistic fucked up joke on you to try and make you kill yourself. I would never do something like that but it almost gets to a point where it truly is hilarious. How does someone go 3 years of living life and not meeting one person that\u2019s single ? I can\u2019t even make any fucking friends because I can\u2019t fucking find anybody that\u2019s not single lmao. If it wasn\u2019t happening in my own life I wouldn\u2019t even believe it. ",

Everybody around is already having girlfriends and going out and spending time with other, but me no I am so lonely. I barely talk to anybody and over the past week I realised how little people or people I call friends care about me. I don't think I am as attractive as I used to be neither am I doing well academically or have any desirable traits except physical strength and height. I am a good example to all the guys out there thay just because you are tall doesn't mean you get a lot of women ( I am 6ft 4 - 6ft 5 or 193 - 195cm tall ) they still don't care. I am just so scared I will be alone and no body will want to be with me for the rest of my life. I am scared and I am tired. Thank you for taking the time out of your day to read this I wish to all of you good luck in this journey and I hope you guys don't ever get to feel like this!

I\u2019ve completely changed as a person and I get panic attacks If I\u2019m too uncomfortable\n2. Ever since my hair transplant that went bad (I\u2019m bald now) I\u2019ve had a psychotic break or something in my brain clicked off. I have severe body dsymoprhia now that doesn\u2019t allow me to work in public, develop close relationships and I generally just stay away from people and isolate I rarely ever not wear a hat or a beanie unless I trust someone compeltely \n\n3. I do think about ending my life a lot. I\u2019ve become much more comfortable with the idea over the years because I do not think my life will get any better objectively. Could it randomly get better somehow maybe but the odds are that it won\u2019t.\n\nSo in summary, if someone\u2019s life doesn\u2019t really have a chance of getting better, you\u2019re basically so isolated you\u2019ll never really meet any friends or people or have the confidence to do so, then what is the point of existing now what is the point of this life, I\u2019m an empty vessel just floating through space I don\u2019t know.

It\u2019s been really difficult for example she wakes 3-4 times a night, which wakes me up. She\u2019s loud, takes a lot of my parents time etc. there\u2019s a lot of joys that come with my sister but I also feel like it bears a lot of weight, seeing what she goes through and my parents go through, it\u2019s a lot of grief Yano. \n\nFound a job in PR which was only one day a week in the office. I spent 9 months in the job. Found it extremely lonely - I hardly met anyone. \n\nAlso back home I have 0 friends. There are no events I can go to. I live in the middle of nowhere. I ice skate but that\u2019s very much a lonely sport - as is the gym. \n\nI started a Masters in September hoping to make new friends. In my first week I asked a bunch of girls to go out and they said they couldn\u2019t afford to and then went out without me\u2026 lots of things like that happened\u2026 I also live an hour away from uni so it\u2019s difficult to make friends there because I can\u2019t just go and see them very easily. \n\nI\u2019m trying to keep this brief. \n\nI\u2019ve been applying and applying for grad schemes and just getting rejected, even got to assessment centres with Mondelez international, Premier foods and AB World. But got nothing. \n\nJust feel like I have no friends and no job, nothing to show for myself.\n\nI get rlly scared on Saturday nights just looking at my Snap maps seeing if there\u2019s anyone I can reach out to and there simply isn\u2019t. \n\nI get really scared thinking about getting married and not having anyone on my side of the wedding. \n\nI do however have a fantastic boyfriend but he lives 3 hours away. And everyone I meet through him really likes me. I\u2019m really good friends with one of his best mates girlfriends. Likewise, everyone on my course is really nice to me, excited to see me. But I ask them to do something and there\u2019s an excuse or no one is fussed. \n\nIdk \n\nJust feel like I\u2019m slipping through the net? Like I\u2019ve just been really unlucky the last couple years. Having to move back home was a massive thing that meant I had to start my life over again in a countryside trying to make friends from scratch. \n\nAny advise? Anyone feeling the same?

I have friends in the city that I\u2019m in, but no best friends, or anyone that I would turn to.\n\nI have so much to be thankful for, but I still feel lonely, and I\u2019m tired of being alone.

Obviously, sometimes being single gets the best of me, and I can\u2019t get really lonely. I tried my best to smile enjoy life as it is, but other days I am so tired of this feeling like I am so unimportant. I really don\u2019t have much going on in my life. I typically don\u2019t hear from people, unless I make the effort to reach out.  No one considers me, their favorite person, and I don\u2019t have a favorite person. I\u2019m stuck. And sometimes I feel like I simply just exist. I\u2019m just taking up space in this universe with no purpose or meaning. I have a good paying job and I live a comfortable and happy lifestyle. I can afford some of the nicer things in life, and I have had some really cool life experiences. But I just feel empty. I have felt empty for the past year or so, and some days are great, but some days it just get the best of me. I just don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m open to making more friends, but don\u2019t know what spaces to do that, and you can\u2019t force friendships.

But I simply just tired of just existing in my own lonely, space, and there\u2019s no meaning to anything that I\u2019m doing\n",

        "text": "I'm 22 years old. I grew up isolated in a way, always moving from place to place. Never really was able to retain friendships as a kid. I have a large extended family that all live abroad. I feel a strong connection to them but rarely see them, contributing to the feeling of isolation. I have friends but I often feel a sense of disconnection from them, and I often feel like I'll always be alone or be lonely. I catch myself clinging onto people that make me feel less lonely and understood so hard, but it often ends in disappointment. What can I do to stop feeling like this? To stop relying on others to feel okay? I really rely on friends to help me feel emotionally stable, but I'm scared everyone will get tired of me because I always have problems. I try not to burden other people with my feelings of anxiety and sometimes depression but occasionally I can't help but need to talk about it with somebody. I'm scared that there's an inherent problem with me, and that's why I'll always feel lonely.",

        "text": "This is my daily log entry number fifty-one, because I have too many thoughts and no one to share them with\u2026\n\nToday was a fine day. I went to the Asian store to see if I could get some Filipino spaghetti sauce, but of course, the ban across the U.S. is still going on, so they were out of stock... Only one brand is going through the borders at the moment, and people buy them out really quick, so I\u2019m not surprised I didn\u2019t get any. I just don\u2019t understand it, though. What\u2019s so \u201ccancer-causing\u201d about the ingredients when I\u2019ve been eating the stuff my whole life and haven\u2019t died? What\u2019s even more concerning is the fact that the States has their *own* cancer-causing ingredients that are literally *banned in Europe,* so what they think about our spaghetti sauce is hypocrisy at best\u2026\n\nAnyway, I went straight to that burger place I was talking about in my last log after that, and the food was *delicious.* The prices on the reviews online are no longer accurate to post-inflation America, so it was pricier by a buck or two, but it was worth it! The burgers were HUGE; I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen that many mushrooms on a mushroom swiss. The fries were what my dad described as \u201cnatural fries\u201d that aren\u2019t heavily processed like the ones at McDonald\u2019s. The place was also a very cute, little country diner so the ambiance was on point despite the rain and cold. \n\nI don\u2019t think I ever ate a burger so fast, lolol. \n\nBut, you know \u2014 just when my day was going pretty good, I noticed a really bad scratch on my car. The paint was even *cracked.* It wasn\u2019t there when I went to the Asian store or the burger place, but it was there *after* I came back from the grocery store. I can\u2019t believe someone probably scraped their shopping cart across my car. Although, I\u2019m kinda over it at this point\u2026 I mean \u2014 it\u2019s a 14-year-old hand-me-down from my grandmother that\u2019s already got a few battle scars, so I expected that to happen. \n\nThe only thing that sucks about it is how I can *never* fully enjoy life; just when things are going great, something has to go wrong\u2026 \n\nWell, I\u2019m gonna finish up this section on the brain and language, and then clean my shower before dinner. \n\nHave a great day, everyone. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I have my family, my friends, neighbours etc. But is it weird to feel lonely while having a \"great\" social life? Would you prefer having only 1-2 friends who is a good listener, supporting, having a lot of common things etc? I mean the people who you feel confident about telling them your secrets or your personal stuff. Or would you prefer having 30 people who wont accept you as who you are and you dont feel confident with them because they are the most judgmental people? \n\nWell, that is not mine correct answer but I have the second option. Dude omg I dont know how to describe this feeling with words but, I can say it is so much fucking terrible. My feelings are stuck in my head and there is no one to talk. Actually there is but they are just numbers. Numbers cant talk and cant understand your emotions. How do you all find your soulmate?\n\nIm just tired of always being in the background. I have feelings too. I have emotions too. Im tired of when people hear my name and say \"oh I know him. He is a friend\". Im tired of being \"just a friend\". When people have an argument or fight with their bestfriend or friend group, they always come to me to talk. They dont have a person to talk and hang out at that time. So they go to \"just a friend\" to hang out. (once a month)\n\nI've never been someones best friend in my life. Ive been in a few friend groups and I am in a friend group currently but, again the same background person. I am not a quiet and introvert person by the way. I just need a person literally to TALK. Im very jeaolus of people who has a bestfriend. And wait, I had bestfriends too, but they always \"didnt describe\" me as bestfriend. \n\nI need to find a person who treats me in the first place, looks at me like I am in their first place. (by first place I mean of course except their family and gf)\nSo how do you guys find your bestfriend soulmate? I am in a excess need of help these days.\n\n",

These past years have been extremely painful and I have been doing basically nothing aside from suffering.

I have always struggled with my mental health but these days it feels impossible to keep going.

I do tend to respond immediately out of a principle of treating people how I'd like to be treated. I've called my parents once every 3 months and texted them maybe an average of once every two weeks. Still can't get them to respond to a text the same day. Text my sister about once a month and don't really call her anymore. She'll maybe respond in 2 or 3 days. Same results with \"friends\".\n\nI can understand coworkers. It's work. Who wants to respond quickly? Thing is, I'm now considered, idk, the 6th or 7th most senior person on our 50 person department. Many of the messages I send also would directly and immediately benefit their career and performance and make their job easier if they just responded. I'm still frequently ghosted and if I get a response it's in days.\n\nYou have no idea how humiliating it can feel to have sent 4 high-importance messages to coworkers, 3 messages to family, and 2 messages to \"friends\" and have nothing in your notifications for the entire day. It legitimately feels like I'm a ghost trying to get the real world to \"see\" me.\n\nThen my therapist and the internet tells me to love myself. It just feels like for everyone else fighting life is a breeze while for me it's a jet stream and people are watching going, \"Just get bigger legs bro.\" I know I need to do some \"lifting\" myself and provide myself with some of that validation and love. But, damn. It'd be nice if I wasn't literally entirely alone on this.",

Since then I have moved countries once more but have always lived alone. I was so excited when first moving out of my parents house as I am a very independent person and thought that this would solve all my problems for me. My parents are very chill and never gave me any strict rules so not quite sure why I thought this, but I guess I just wanted to move away from my home town. Anyways I hate living alone even after all these years. Whenever I visit my parents during holidays I am so happy and cry every time I have to leave. I have a great friend group where I live but I feel like it\u2019s quite superficial and everyone only cares about themselves, which is fair enough they probably think the same about me. But I have two best friends who live in a completely different country and with them I don\u2019t feel this at all. But moving to my parents or to them is just not feasible as I am still studying and even after could not imagine working on any of these places. How do you deal with the loneliness of always coming home to an empty apartment and never having anyone to talk to or do things with at home? I am also quite sick at the moment so this might intensify my feelings, but I\u2019m just always so sad when I am apart from these people. \n\nTLDR: I have lived alone for 3 years and still feel so lonely whenever I am away from my parents or best friends who are in different countries, how to deal with this?

For a long time beginning in early 2021, I worked very hard to change my circumstances as far as having friends goes. It\u2019s been here and there, and people come and go, but what happened today just reminds me how much this whole process just hurts\u2026\n\nThe friends I had for a couple of years just took a trip to New Orleans. I felt very sad that I was the one not invited\u2026I know not everyone needs to be everywhere, but this was a small group and they\u2019ve all basically stopped talking to me. I reached out to one of the girls and was able to make plans. \n\nI took her to a brunch place she picked out. It was for her birthday and I picked up the tab (technically after her birthday. I don\u2019t know what she did for the actual thing aside from a weekend at her sister\u2019s place in the area). \n\nDuring that, she asked if I\u2019d ever been to New Orleans and I said I hadn\u2019t. She said she asked because she knows I like to travel a lot (I suppose that\u2019s true? These day I mostly visit my SIL). I said I\u2019d love to go though. It looks really fun, especially for Mardi Gras. She mentions she\u2019s looking at going there with people. \n\nAnyway there was more to it, but why even tell me about it? And then I see one of the other girls posting all these videos of them hanging out together like we used to. \n\nI just don\u2019t get what I\u2019ve done wrong. I was very late to meet her once but we all did things after that. Saw Stevie nicks together. Went up north. But there must be something about me, like I must be very awkward or boring or just not be a very good friend to have. Because they\u2019re all still hanging out and they don\u2019t talk to me anymore unless I very strategically reach out. \n\nAnd I don\u2019t think they\u2019re awful people at all. They\u2019re very nice, and normal, and fun. \n\n\u2026 \ud83d\ude1e I\u2019m just feeling very down. Advice or whatever like that is welcome but not necessary. I don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m looking for anymore.\n\nI don\u2019t think hiding from social media is the solution btw bc it\u2019s not that it looks glamorous, I know all that , social media inflates the appearance of fun, it\u2019s just that I\u2019ve been in those places and now I\u2019m not. And ignoring that is only going to feel worse later when I get to know it by word of mouth. I have to face my sadness and my feeling left out even if it hurts bc it\u2019ll come up eventually if not now via Snapchat.\n\nTl;dr; everyone hangs out without me 99% of the time these days and I have to face that reality and I feel sad and left out.\n\nIf you read this far, thanks for listening to me vent. I know I am being a big baby and that this was a lot.",

        "text": "The more and more you grow up you discover things about yourself, continually expanding your worldview and discovering new ideas. I'm from the middle east, born and raised there. I'm transgender, bi, and an atheist.  \n  \nThese are things that I cannot change about myself, it's who I am. My identity and beliefs have completely isolated me during high school and college. How am I supposed to have any genuine and deep friendships/relationships when everyone I befriend viciously opposes my identity and beliefs?  \n  \nI cannot connect with these people on a deeper level, I am completely estranged by any serious \"discussion\" because it always comes back to \"god said so\" - and what am I supposed to say? I can't just come out or I'll make things worse, so I just shut up and avoid any such conversations. I can't even distract myself from life by hanging out with friends because the thought of \"These people would despise and possibly even hurt me if they knew who I actually was.\"  is constantly whispering in the back of my head.  \n  \nSometimes I perform a \"litmus test\" on my friends to check that maybe they are like me. I would ask questions like \"what would you do if your child turned out gay?\" and pose it as a joke. Just to hear their thoughts, but it never goes well. They always come up with the most hateful, bigoted, and violent replies. One friend posed a question in return to the group - \"Would you kill a queer person given the chance? No consequences involved.\" which of course was met by a unanimous yes I totally would from the other folk.   \n  \nThis same \"friend\" described to me in detail how they would torture a queer person, walking me through the steps while putting his hands on my body to enact his methods. Some of these people are my childhood friends, pals since middle school. At a certain point, I couldn't lie to myself anymore. These people aren't joking or just ignorant and naive. \n\nSo here I am now, in my third year of college with about 2 people who I can really be honest and safe around (not really deep relationships though, they only know I'm atheist). I've tried the internet as an alternative but it just hasn't worked so far - I don't know maybe it's just not for me or I'm not interesting enough. All this isolation and lack of any type of intimacy has made me lose motivation in everything.",

There's this idea that you can be alone and not lonely but not alone and feel lonely.\n\nIt's true but in *generally and in most cases*, loneliness is cured by actually being a valued member of society which entails having people around, either friends, family or a loving relationship.\n\nSo, if you almost *never* are around people, it's almost impossible to not feel lonely. Don't let spiritual gurus tell you otherwise. They're wrong in my opinion because they are forgetting that we are social creatures.",

No social life, no friends, no love, no goals, Nothing. Just... nothing\n\nI\u2019m so lonely that i used to attached to anyone who text me for a few days, thinking they are friends (because i saw them as friends), until they disappears like all the others... Maybe i was stupid, or maybe i was just that desperate? \n\nIt's so funny how i avoid romance scenes in movies because they make me feel like I'm missing out on something beautiful, something I\u2019ll never have, (even straight relationships scenes, yeah I'm gay...), thats why i only watch shows without romance lol, i always relate to that scene in suicide squad where king shark watches people through the bus window, trapped behind the glass\n\nSpeaking of missing out, i missed everything lmao, my teenage years were empty, no love stories, no adventures, no unforgettable moments, Just a blank void, and now at 21 i think about suicide more than i\u2019d like to admit, not that I\u2019d ever do it nah i\u2019m too much of a coward...

I'm a 35 year old single mom and i started going back to school. that for me was huge because i had to step out of my comfort zone and push myself to be around ppl. I'm lonely as hell.... idk what I'm doing and it always feels like I'm going to be alone forever. idk how to talk to ppl. i have no filter and say stupid things all the time.  :( i don't have any social media because i don't like posting pictures of myself and i don't have ppl to interact with. my life is basically my kids and school. I hate myself.",

        "text": "(17M) I recently graduated a semester early and realized I went through all 4 years without having a single close genuine friend. Almost anyone I talked to at the time was only talked to me because i was their person to vent to or their romantic interest at the time. I get jealous when I see people who just have that 1 person they do everything with. I'm not a super social person but im not a hermit yk? Sometimes I wonder if I'm the problem or I'm just not around the right people, even when I try to socialize I feel like I'm begging for spare change sometimes. I usually tell myself \"we'll 90% of friendships don't make it out of highschool anyways\" or I just don't worry about it as a whole to cope but it gets old. \n\nI recently started talking to someone I met a couple months back and we pretty much clicked and I thought I finally made a friend  but I'm back to square one.\n\nAm I tripping? Any advice or anyone dealing with a similar situation?",
