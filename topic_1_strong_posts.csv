"And so, I need to get some things of my chest.","*Every day I wake up, then I start to break up...*

  
Just for clarification - I'm writing this after 10 hour night shift in my country, and English is not my first language. 

  
Anyway, I feel empty inside for long time. I'm right now at the end of my studies... Went all without love. And you know what's worst? The thing that I was in love once. 

The story begins before the university. I knew a girl, who cheated on me. That's the important part - and the fact that her new boyfriend had to brag about ""stealing my girlfriend"" on my DMs. 

Went to the university in diffrent city, hoping to find someone. Was there not enough stories about loser who goes to new place and finds his love? Five years later - this is not one of this stories. Because of being desperate, I pushed people away from me. I was acting pathetic and honestly? I would stay away from myself. However, I just want to put emphasis on the fact, that I'm NOT the same guy as five years ago. I'm not acting all ""I'm so sad, so miserable"" (and yes, I know the fact that this post goes against this). 

I think the worst part is that I know that it's not them, not ""being misunderstood"". The blame is on me, the burden is mine to bear - that it was me, who pushed away any chances. And who lost. 

But well, I didn't give up. Had to survive, being a coward. Yes, a coward, because It's not hope, it's fear that kept me still. Fear of death, of making the last straw... Call it however you want. Mind that it was pandemic, and I was literally locked up. 

So I started looking for people. After all, that's the advice everyone will give you, right? Dating apps are biased (and with my face being the 100% working anticonecption, I had no hope. i tried them, so it's not just ""it would end that way!""), so the best is to have a hobby and go there, to find someone who will love you, and the pasion will join you two!

Yeah, sure. Here's a list:

\- I playe TTRPGs. Joined a server four years ago, with our community recruited in a way ""I know a guy who wants to play"". Guess who's still alone. 

\- I play video games. I'm on a server from one game I really like. Guess what. 

\- I joined a students organisation focused on integration - basiclly we meet for once for roughly two weeks and drink alcohol, sing shanties... Not a parties, mind you. More like ""a group of colleagues goes out"" is best description. 

\- I like to read books. So started a small book club. 

And I want to tell you one important thing, why fate decided that I'm gonna stay forever alone. 

When there's a girl in one of the higher groups... She has someone. A boyfriend, a fiance, a husband. Of course, not every girl. 

Of course it's not every case. There are girls who are single. They are lesbian.

That's the 100% girls who I meet in these spaces. And ending my studies, I feel like my options are ending. Yes, there is work... 

But being a night creature I am, I will be looking for Night Shift. That usually are single employee.

And now, what's the most burdening thing? I'm still a virgin. Yes, I know, sex is not that awesome, it will be bad, because every first time is bad, it's not the most definig thing in your life...

They're just telling a hungry man that food is not important and it will taste bad. A metaphor for me, but can you really tell in our culture ""you should not want to have sex once""? And yes, I know about sex workers. It's just... It doesn't feel the same in my mind. I put the diffrence between sex with someone who loves you and paying someone for sex.  

And I'm afraid. Because I don't want to become a wizard. 

Among my friends I am know as the ""clown"", ""the jester"", ""the meme professor"". And yes, I tell jokes about being a wizard, about the right hand. And yes, they laugh with me. 

But then comes a nights like this one - where I feel like a nobody. Like I could disappear and they wouldn't even notice. The family and pressure do not help, but this is not this kind of sub. It's just that I feel like the funny kid when I come back to my home, or sit in work when nothing happens. And start thinking, how my bed will stay cold. How I can't even hug anybody with romantic feelings.  How I am alone in all of this. How even if there is a girl, I lose headstart. Because I have some kind of honor - I'm not going after taken girls. 

And worst? How I tasted this. How I know what it feels to be loved. How it feels to be important to someone and knowing someone is important to you. How it feels to kiss. 

I miss this feelings. 

A question that will forever remains - is it better to stay in the unknown, never knowing how it is being loved? Or is it better to taste this, and then never more?

To end this in a bit positive note, I will quote a comment I once read on youtube under doomer mix. Yes, I listened to them. Yes, I was going on nightwalks. Yes, I was... And I still am a doomer. And yes, the comment is cheesy and stupid... But I like it.

  
*We all live all our tragedies alone, but at least we're together.* "
I’m spiraling and don’t know what to do,"
(Sorry for the messy English, it's not my 1st language)

About 8-9 months ago, I (19M) walked in on my then GF in bed with another guy. Needless to say, this one event (and the ensuing messy breakup) did a number on my mental health and it took me a very long time to get back to where I was. I went on a healing journey, picked up some hobbies, stayed consistent at the gym, and I tried to expand my horizons a little bit. All to make me a better person and with the goal of becoming more desirable. Don't get me wrong, I'm proud of my progress, but I was perfectly happy with the person I was before the breakup (Gym 5x a week, fluent in 3 languages, decent personality, etc.), so my main motivator behind further self improvement was finding a life partner.

Now recently, I felt ready enough to start dating again. The apps were a complete disaster. Less than 10 matches total over 2 months (I tended to swipe right on 50% of profiles), with most either never responding or being bots/scammers. I did also go out and meet people, both through my hobbies (Rugby, book club, volunteering mainly), and at bars and clubs (usually went out with my friends on Fridays). I've always struggled to talk to women (really bad social anxiety and ADHD), so I never got anywhere at clubs and bars. I was able to give good impressions but I could never keep someone's attention before they got bored or moved on to the next guy. I had a bit more luck at the food bank I volunteer at and met this wonderful girl there.

We hit it off really quickly. Turns out we share a lot of the same interests (she was also a big reader and had been interested in rugby), and she even had the same tastes as I did with both TV and books. It all really seemed too good to be true, but when we get comfortable with each other I asked her out for coffee. Things went really well, and we committed to a 2nd date. The 2nd date also went well and we started dating regularly. We really clicked and started dating regularly. I made sure to be myself, which she seemed to enjoy, and I didn't bring up anything too sexual unless the conversation prompted it. I felt like I may have finally found that happiness I was chasing with my ex, so I made plans to ask her to be exclusive on our 6th date. We made plans, and I paid for a reservation at a pretty nice restaurant. I also set up a small surprise at an overlook nearby where I'd pop the question.

I never got that far.

On the day, I texted her in the morning to make sure we were still on, and we updated each other throughout the day. Originally the plan was for me to pick her up and drive us, but she told me something came up and she'd meet me there. I guess this was the first red flag. I got to the restaurant, and I waited. I tried texting and calling, but 0 response. I waited until the restaurant called and told me they couldn't hold our reservation anymore, so I cancelled it, went home, and just cried for a very long time. I've been rejected, ghosted, and even stood up since I had started dating again but it never felt like actual betrayal before.

This was all 3 days ago and I don't think I've ever felt this lonely. At this point I've lost my motivation and only get out of bed to attend classes and get my homework done. I feel like some kind of freak, undeserving of love. I push everyone away, I did it with my ex, and now I've done it with this girl and I don't even know what I did wrong. She seemed fine earlier in the day but just dissappears later. We've met and hung out so many times. I just feel disgusted by myself. I thought I could handle failure but at this point it feels like a pattern with me as the common denominator. I feel pathetic getting this hung up over someone I wasn't even in a relationship with, and all the repressed memories from my past breakup have come rushing back.

I've started to resent dating, but there's nothing I'd hate more than to become that one guy who sits in front of his computer all day and blames women for all his misfortunes. I want to be better. I work on myself constantly in order to be someone I can take pride in, I work out 5 times a week and I'm proud of my current state. But whats the point of living this life if I've got no one to share it with? All my close friends rave about how awesome their partners are, and how great they feel as a couple, while all I could do was grin and bear it with the hopes that I would also find someone I could share that joy with, but not anymore. I'm so close to giving up and I just can't see the point of going thru all this effort when it results in nothing.

Sorry for the vent, but I'm just so frustrated, it seems that no matter what you do, something happens. Either someone funnier/better looking comes along, or they realize they're not ready for a relationship, or they find out I'm just plain ugly. I just wish I could at least know why."
Sometimes I just don't know what to do,"Kinda a bit lost 1/2

I'm 25 male Autistic living in Scotland. I have ended up being homeless partly through my fault but also partly parents are to blame. 

So since the age of 12 me and my parents been arguing non stop by the time I was 16 I came out as Bi/Pansexual kinda had a rough time my dad said I'm not gay until I have had up my arse and I came out to the rest of my family as I wanted to bring boyfriends home etc. My fathers dad then informs me I should be disowned verbal abuse and all sorts and then basically police got involved as he called me a p oof and basically went to court he got a slap on the wrist and was told does it again back to court… 

18 me and my parents argue they start to use the threat of pack your bags and leave 

2020 I lost my gran ( my mums mum) before covid I then isolate with my grandad and its decent me and my parents don't argue I finally come home to my dad feeling guilty but he basically said that he didn't miss me being away.

Throught all of this I'm arguing and getting the threat of pack your bags and leave. 

November 2024 I start my own business 

Christmas 2024 I get told that I'm acting spoilt and that basically I always do this and try to be the centre of attention. 
( I was upset my siblings had more presents than me) 

January 2nd I approach my team lead who is also our first aid for mental health officer to discuss the feeling I have of taken myself off to a mental health institution to just catch a break away from the arguing she says that she is approachable and basically if I need mental health support to send a text or phone and we can chat the following day when I'm back on shift… 

Feb/March I put a housing application into the council parents make it out that I'm the worst son ever that i am doing this to hurt them… 

April 8th 2025 we argue all day near enough everything is stressful my dad might have cancer etc and we basically have been arguing all week my parents have enough and tell me to pack my bags I do I decided enough was enough of this all I pack my bags and leave to stay at my grans. 

I work Wednesday I send my team lead a text to say look need to talk mental health stuff and explain what's went down comes into work they avoid me my manger pulls me aside ask how I am I say just peachy I'm here and she goes what do you mean I tell her I'm homeless she then says oh I'm sorry and then proceeded to say that I need to stop reaching out to mental health officer as seemingly she gave me her personal number… 

Yesterday I have had to re-apply for universal credit as my appointee doesn't want to be my appointee anymore I have tried to speak to shelter Scotland I have no clue what to do.

Life feels monotone and I think its starting to get to me.,"I usually never minded it as much but recently I've just felt tired all the time. I'm not getting work done like I've used to. Always putting it off til late at night and then I do basically nothing for the whole day. And its the same shit every week too.
Just getting up and going to class, sitting down in my room. 

I'm always glad I left high school but everything after has never exactly felt exciting. Am I supposed to be enjoying life? I'm not, or atleast I think I don't. More like putting up with it. You're supposed to be glad to go to college but I'm sure not. You're supppsed to have friends but I sure don't. Everyone I knew I left back in high school, and even then I never did anything with them. 

I was a fucking idiot then and still am. I had friends but I never did shit. They'd ask me for my socials and what did I do? I blew them off. Can't have people thinking I needed ""friends"". Oh no, I was ""too good"". Same shit here and now. Brief conversations with classmates that ends once the lecture is over. Every now and then me and a girl converse when we spot each other on campus. But its like a fucking random encounter in a video game. 

None of it is constant. No one talks to me outside of class for the most part. No one messages me. My only hint of sociality is my fucking family. And I hate it. I know what my problem is, I'm not even fucking trying to get out there. Yet nothing changes. I'm still sitting on my ass in my room all the time. I used to not care about it. After all, the only person that really matters is myself right? But now I feel so tired and lazy. I hate being lazy. But I don't ever wanna do my work. I just put up with it. For today, and the next, and the rest of the week. And the next week. The month. The year. Fuck this shit.

Sometimes I wish I was born an idiot so that I wouldn't have to think so much. Then maybe I'd have some joy in myself. I can't ever like anything. Or be excited for anything. Not my birthday in a few weeks, or finishing this semester. I don't like how my body is either, I'm skinny, and have a belly which I don't like. Not that it matters anyways, no one ever sees it.

It just all feels monotone. Thats the way I can describe it. Its not hell. That would probably be more exciting. Its just boring. I wish I had actual friends, but I'd prolly just keep them at arms length too. Forgot about a girlfriend, no one's ever interested in me. And I'm not really even asking for help here either. Its funny in a way. I'm just screaming out somewhere, maybe hoping someone answers, but I'm not gonna even answer back. It's not like anyone fucking cares. 

Fuck this shit. I hope you all have a good day. Mine are always the same. "
I'm wasting away my 20s,"hi, im new here but i didnt know where else to turn. i just desperately needed to put my thoughts into words and feel heard by someone, even if its just a bunch of strangers on the internet.

covid changed a lot of things for me, as it did for many of us. i didn't realize how good i had it until i let everything slip away. i had several different friend groups, hobbies that made me feel fulfilled, and a bright future ahead of me. i was a senior in high school, so we never got a real chance to say goodbye to anyone. life shut down, we graduated remotely, and then it was time for everyone to go their separate ways. before i could even realize, everyone was already setting out on their own lives. and then there was me.

i was nowhere near ready for college. i didnt know that at the time of course. thats why i dropped out- twice. i completely fucked my freshman year by meeting an abusive guy on tinder. i was isolated from the few people i managed to start getting to know. and my friends from high school had long forgotten about me by then.

running away from home to a new city was what really put the final nail in the coffin of my social life. i didn't realize until then that i'd never truly made a friend organically by myself. i'd always just been lucky enough to be approached first, or met people through mutual friends. covid took the few social skills i had and made them nonexistent. i've been almost entirely alone for the past 5 years and the older i get the further away the hope of finding any worthwhile friends seems to drift.

im living my parents again. our relationship has always been strained. i can tell im not what they pictured when they first decided to become parents. i've always been more alternative in my interests and self-expression. my parents couldnt be more different from me. the only thing thats kept our relationship afloat is the blood relation and shared history together.

i've had a boyfriend for the past 3 years and he's the only person i've ever felt like truly gets me. although that in itself is kinda sad. i cant make a single friend but i can get a romantic relationship so easily. seems like sex/love may be the only thing people see in me. any man i've tried developing a friendship with has showed me that much at least. i feel awful for constantly having to put so much emotional burden on my bf, but he's genuinely the only one i have at this point. i'd probably be dead without him in all honesty. we both really want to have a future together, eventually get married too. but i cant stop thinking about how if we were to get married, i wouldn't even have enough friends to have any bridesmaids, or even a maid of honor. 

im back in college now, this time going for straight A's. im joining clubs, well, a club. it's been 2 years now and i still havent made a single friend there. the closest thing i have to a friend are my coworkers, but our relationships are very surface level. it's gotten to the point where i LIKE going to work, despite how much my job sucks, solely because its the one place i get to socialize with people my age, and get paid for it. 

everyone is always so busy so we can never make plans, myself included. by the time im done with school and work, im too burnt out to even want to try socializing. and then im sitting in my room crying about how lonely i am. and the cycle just keeps repeating.

every time i try to make friends or even so much as talk to people i feel like a burden. i never know what to say, so in most cases i just awkwardly stand around people, just waiting for the moment i can say something relevant or contribute in any way. occasionally, i'll get a laugh. but i'm constantly feeling like a 3rd, 5th... 20th wheel in everything i do. like nobody ever wants me around, like im constantly just intruding in others conversations because at our ages everyone already has their established friend groups, so nobody ever even gives me a chance. at this point im just hoping that i'll attract people if im just THERE. if im around long enough, eventually i'll assimilate with the people around me and maybe grow a deeper connection with someone, ANYONE.

so i guess all this is to say that making friends in your 20s, especially when you've fucked your life up as much as i have, is really damn hard. so now i'm just sitting in my bed wasting away what are supposed to be the ""best years of my life"" crying and venting to strangers on reddit."
"Virgin 28M, never kissed or had a girlfriend","I just don't understand it. I don't understand it. I wish things had turned out differently. But here I am at 28 years old. I just wish I knew what a kiss felt like. I just want to be able to be intimate with someone. I just want someone to love me. Why is that so hard to find? My dad tells me ""let her come to you, she'll come to you in time."" But he's been saying that for the past decade. That's all he does. He doesn't actually help me meet people. Whenever I explain how I feel to him, he just gets agitated and babbles on about how lonely he feels too, which doesn't make me feel any better. Literally nothing has happened romantically or even like finding a friend who is a woman, in my life at all. No one really seems to care, no one cares.

Nothing is happening and nothing is going to happen. I'm done pretending, I'm done hoping. The only thing I want is the answer why, and I don't know. I have no opportunities to meet people. From some small town in the US. I work from home full-time. Dating apps don't work. I am a Christian and have tried Upward for months. I swipe right on every single profile I see, like 200 swipes a day. I get a few, maybe 2 likes a day when I do this, that are literally all comprised of unattractive or overweight women that I just don't feel attracted to. I'm not bashing them. It's just not my thing. And even when I do message them on the app, which I do even though I don't feel attracted to them - because you might as well try, right? - they never respond. I'm not asking for a movie star - just someone who looks even somewhat decent. What is wrong with me, why are girls repulsed from me? Why do they immediately lose interest in me as soon as they see me? What is it about me? I just don't understand it.

I tried eHarmony, which is a scam and no one replied to me on that platform either. It's like the site is dead. I'm not into hookups, so I don't use Tinder. And I tried ChristianMingle to no avail. I don't know what to do. I don't think there's anything I can do. 

I just want someone who cares about me, will reach out to me and hug me and love me, but it's just too much to ask from a woman to do that. They're just not willing.

I used to have hope, when I was more ignorant about the world, a long time ago. As the years passed and I started getting older, my hope slowly eroded away. Now I realize it's already too late. I'm supposed to be way farther along in life - I have several mental illnesses that set me back a long way - but no one really cares anyway. Everyone is too wrapped up in their own romantic drama and their own lives to care about me. I just don't understand.

The few friends that I used to have mostly just told me that I need to be happy single, marriage is not as glamorous as I think, and compared my situation to people worse off than me. Didn't help much.

My life isn't going anywhere, and my life is consumed by work and depression. I just wish I had a solution.

It's so discouraging when a doctor or therapist refuses to see you,"This will probably be long...so I've been trying to get help again after about a year of not seeing any kind of professional and I've encountered one obstacle after another. I had recently tried going back to an outpatient program and that didn't go well but I'd like to stay on the medication they had placed me on. I've made several phone calls, trying to get an appointment with a new prescriber, and left messages but no place is returning my call. I went back to a community mental health clinic today and was told that the nurse practictioner will no longer see me. When I asked why, all they would tell me is that he will no longer see me. She said it in a really cheerful, fake voice. Like it's so common to be refused mental health treatment for no reason.

I was told, however, that I could go back next Tuesday and see the psychiastrist who works there but I still don't trust them. I'm trying to form a back up plan to get my medication in case things don't work out. All that I want is Trileptal. Before that, I was on Lamictal but I find that this is working better. However, I strongly suspect that I'm going to run out before I can get a new prescription and I'm thinking of giving up once again and just facing things with no medication or therapy.

A walk in clinic here in town told me on Wednesday that they would give me a one month supply of Trileptal on a time basis. They were very serious about that and I could tell that they meant it. I could get a 30 day supply but never ask them again. However he said that he first needed to see my bottle of medication and I didn't have it with me. I started to go home and get it and go back that day but I didn't. And today there was a different nurse practitoner working. When I showed him my bottle he made a face and said that he could only give me enough to last me a day or two and I could tell by the way he was talking to me that he really didn't want to deal with me at all. He said that if I run out, then the pharmacy would give me more. I almost started laughing. I told him that there was no way the pharmacy was going to give me more pills. Doesn't matter what kind they are; they just don't do that. I informed him that the other person had said I could have a one month supply, one time only. He said no, that's not how they work.

But it's not just medication. I was once discharged from an outpatient program for not making enough progress. The director even called me into her office and chewed me out. I rememeber her pointing her finger at me and yelling, ""You haven't chaged at all!"" ""You haven't changed at all!"" I'll admit, I had lost all the progess I had made which I'm sure is frustrating from their end. But nobody gave me credit for all the progress I had made there before I started gettting depressed again.

It hurts so bad to be treated this way by mental health professionals. The very people who are supposed to help. I think they're often disrespectful simply because they can get away with it. They're stressed out and they take some of that frustration out on us. Or they associate mental patients with trouble. Or drug seeking behavior. Mostly, I think they just see us as profoundly sick people who they would often rather not have anything to do with. Why they chose this career, I have no idea but it seems obvious to me that they see us in a negative way and this often makes me want to just hide all my symptoms the best I can and have nothing to do with mental health treatment."
"I just want romance, is this too much to ask?","God, I tried. Dating apps: Tinder, Grindr, Feeld, Bumble, Pure, you name them.

The constant swipes, people ghosting me, fake accounts, and so on. Available brain time. Commodification of people, to consume affection & attention. I fucking hate it.

I just want true real pure romance. Romantic love.

I am sick & tired of FWB, sex friends, fuck buddies, ONS, fuck that shit. I'm so tired to be seen and to see others just as fuck meats.

I know love is real: I have friends, family, art, my studies/college, passions, dreams, goals.

But romance? Where is romance?

I want to eat ice cream on a hot sunny summer day with my significant other. To feel the grass under our bodies and to make out while listening to a playlist I made for them.

I want to write praising, worshipping poems to show how wonderful they are, to express how much I love them.

I want to do groceries together, to compare products, to share about our childhood favourite dishes and to talk while waiting in the queue.

I want to take silly pictures with them at a photobooth after a movie night.

I want to take their hand when we wait for our food at a restaurant and to gaze at each other.

I want to shower them with gifts.

I want to fight back my ADHD and to be able to watch a movie or a series with them while holding hands together on a sofa couch in the living room.

I want to massage them after a long day at work.

Oh, to be seen as a love interest for once...

Oh, to show love. To be loved and to love.

Is this too much to ask? Nowadays? In today's society?"
16M and autistic (high functioning),"im very lonely right now. i haven't had a gf in all of my life and i don't leave my house or even my room basically all day every day unless i have to go to school. i kid you not im listening to this rn [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOLmkjaciJQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOLmkjaciJQ) its a asmr comfort video, i know its kind of embarrassing but i really hate myself in the sense that i am unable to find someone that can love me. i hope that one day i can find someone that will and all i need really is a girl that can comfort me and make feel loved and needed. i feel like a second friend most of the time and that when people think of their best friends i will probably be last on their list. i just want a gf that can love me and hug me even when im sad. i just want someone warm that i can snuggle with in a warm corner with the fire lit and i can talk about how much i love them. but sadly that will never happen and i will never experience teenage love or even adult love or whatever its called. i just need a gf not for any sex\*al means but just innocent love in the sense that we can just hug and talk to each over and share a meal as we relax. its gotten to a point where im so sad i forget to eat so im a measly 50 kilograms right now (its around 113 lbs) so i just want someone to go to a café with me in the winter and drink a hot chocolate together as we both look at each over and smile. I've been rejected before by someone which i genuinely thought i would marry one day but i was dumb to think so. im genuinely not bad looking some could even consider me above average, however i think that maybe im just not nice to be around. i just need comfort above anything rn"
