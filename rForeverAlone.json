And they stay far away from us. Being an ugly man talking to a woman fucking sucks😂 \n\nThey literally think it’s gross that you have a crush on them if you’re ugly I can’t count how many times I’ve gotten an “ew” because a girl assumed I was crushing on her. \nAnd you had like 5 relationships b4?!? Ugly guys don’t even try to get relationships because of how unrealistic it is for us. You’re lying. \n\nSame with forever alone people, you’re not forever alone if you have hundred’s of people in your DMs or you’re dating every week.\n\nI’m not gate keeping being ugly, maybe I am idk. I’m just annoyed because they have no idea what it’s like. The struggles of being outcasted and outshined by everyone, yet they use my insecurity as a way for handout compliments. Fucking pathetic.

She has three kids and two ex-boyfriends. But weirdly enough, we vibed really well. Same music taste, same films, even some overlap in gaming—she played World of Warcraft, which I hadn’t touched in a while, but it got me back into it. I even found her character in-game.\n\nWe met up for coffee. I live in Edinburgh, she’s in Musselburgh. She was in the process of moving from one place to another, and things just… seemed to click. She was funny, relatable, tired-looking but still sweet. We both have some traits of autism and ADHD, so there was this mutual understanding that felt rare and refreshing.\n\nBut now? She’s ghosted me. Like, completely.\n\nCan’t message her on Facebook anymore—just says, “this person cannot be messaged.” Her profile is basically wiped from my end. I didn’t even get a warning. She even blocked me on WoW, which really hit weirdly hard. I still have her character’s name on my list, so maybe I’ll try messaging her there, but I’m not holding my breath.\n\nI really didn’t see any red flags. At first, sure, I was cautious—thought maybe it was a scam. But after meeting her in person, I thought, “nah, this is real.” She seemed genuine. We had a similar lifestyle, and despite me not having kids or any relationship baggage, we seemed to connect well.\n\nShe did say she’d been having a rough week, so I thought maybe she just needed space. But this sudden cut-off? It's confusing as hell. Probably one of the most baffling ghostings I’ve experienced—and I’ve been ghosted before.\n\nAnyway… just venting. I’ll probably send one last message in WoW and see what happens. But yeah. Back to being single. Again.",

I wasn’t sure if you’d just needed space, if you were overwhelmed, or if something else was going on.

But I’ll admit, for someone like me who’s also neurodivergent and finds comfort in clarity, the sudden silence has been really hard to process.\n\nThis isn’t about guilt-tripping or chasing. It’s just me reaching out as a human being who cared and who still hopes you’re doing alright. If you’re in a better place and feel like talking again, I’d still be here. If not, I’ll respect your silence and step away quietly.\n\nTake care of yourself—truly.\nAnd if nothing else… thank you for helping remind me that I still can feel something.

We could be talking for days weeks or months, and things seem to be a lot better than nearly every girl that ghosts me immediately. Then somewhere down the road when I least expect it, I end up getting ghosted or getting a message from the woman why she wants to move on.\n\nI’m gonna say the chances of her being an avoidant is probably small in regards to why she ghosted you like that, but a lot of things are telling me that she probably was trying to use you and only pretend to love you only to do what she did at the end to you. \n\nThis is very likely a major reason why I’m still single because even women like these people who tend to show greater interest than nearly every woman still eventually ends up, ghosting or dumping us. I think she lost interest and tried to block you on Facebook or other platforms because she’s afraid that if she is upfront and doesn’t ghost you, she worries that that you or any other man will threaten to harm her. There are some men out there that when they get rejected for any reason they will threaten to harm a woman. I’m definitely not saying that that’s what you tried to do or what you would do.

For someone who actually dreams of serving, playing a shooter isn’t fulfillment—it’s escapism.\n\nIf something is ‘unreachable,’ the natural response isn’t to settle for fiction—it’s to work toward that goal. Avoiding relationships because they require effort isn’t practicality, it’s just fear disguised as logic.\n\nAlso, flying a plane doesn’t cost millions. Plenty of people become pilots through affordable training programs or university fees.\n\nAnd a girlfriend doesn’t cost an extreme amount either—some dates, gifts, maybe a holiday if you’re serious. The real ‘cost’ is commitment and time, but with that comes mutual support, something AI will never provide.\n\nFake support isn’t support. AI might feel like a safe alternative with no surface level risks, but the real risk is stunting your social and emotional growth by avoiding real relationships altogether. That’s not a solution, that’s self sabotage - whether you like it or not.",

Avoiding relationships because they require too much work is being efficient and realistic. I only have so much energy I can put into things in a single year. I play games because games require very little energy. Getting into a relationship with a real person isn't realistic for everyone. Normal people only have so many friends exactly for that reason.\n\n> Also, flying a plane doesn’t cost millions. Plenty of people become pilots through affordable training programs or university fees.\n\nA plane absolutely costs millions of dollars. To fly one on your own terms would require millions of dollars in maintenance and fuel. A pilot isn't \"flying a plane\" so much as he's maintaining a flight plan, to make sure people make it to their location safely. Furthermore it requires decades of training, while a flight simulator requires zero, so you can just pick it up and play it and switch to something else when you get bored of it.",

We are talking about being in a relationship, which billions upon billions of people have done. \n\nSaying something ‘will never be reached’ regardless of effort is just an excuse to avoid trying. Plenty of people achieve things others call ‘unreachable’ because they actually put in the work instead of rationalizing why they shouldn’t.\n\nAvoiding relationships isn’t ‘efficiency’—it’s self-imposed isolation. If you truly don’t want a relationship, that’s fine. But don’t act like it’s an unattainable goal.\n\nAs for flying, you’ve completely changed your argument. Before, you said becoming a pilot costs millions—it doesn’t. Now you’re talking about owning and maintaining a plane as if that’s the same thing. Most pilots don’t own their planes, just like most people don’t own restaurants but still work as chefs.\n\nAlso, the fact that flight simulators require zero training is exactly why they aren’t real flying—they don’t prepare you for anything. Something that requires zero effort and struggle will also have zero value. That’s the same as an AI ‘relationship’—no depth, no effort, no real experience. You’re just cycling through distractions instead of engaging with reality.",

I said:\n\n> while flying an actual plane requires decades of training and preparation and millions of dollars, \n\nThat **flying** it costs millions of dollars. The pilot of a normal commercial plane isn't really flying it. He's by all account following a very specific flight plan. He doesn't get to randomly make a loop just for fun. He doesn't get to nose dive and accelerate just for fun. He doesn't get to stall the plane just to see if he can recover just for fun. It's a job -- people can die. You're not really \"flying\" anything at all when you're operating a real plane, not unless you managed to get clearance for some crazy things, but that's extremely unlikely, because getting clearance to do anything weird costs a lot of money.\n\n> Also, the fact that flight simulators require zero training is exactly why—they aren’t real flying they don’t prepare you for anything.

You’re saying it’s ‘unreachable’ to get into a relationship with an attractive, healthy woman because you’re unattractive or unhealthy? \n\nThat’s just defeatism. There are countless examples of people improving themselves in these areas, not by being perfect, but by putting in the effort—and that’s the key. Relationships are built on growth and mutual support, not some unattainable ideal of perfection.\n\nAs for the pilot analogy, you’re still changing your argument. Now you’re saying being a pilot ‘requires millions of dollars’ because of things like clearance and theoretical fun loops—but that’s not what regular pilots do, and that’s not what we’re talking about. A commercial pilot is still flying the plane, and you don’t need millions to get there.\n\nIf you want to fly a plane and do loops for fun, you could train to fly a smaller plane. It doesn’t require millions or a strict flight plan. You could easily get a private pilot’s license, which would allow you to fly for fun, do loops, and even take spontaneous detours. This whole argument about pilots not ‘really flying’ and needing millions is just a way to deflect from the point. The reality is that with training and effort, you could get there. And that’s the same with relationships—if you put in the effort to improve yourself, relationships aren’t out of reach.\n\nFlight simulators are great for training, sure, but you spoke about them in a hobbyist capacity & they still don’t replace real-world experience and training. That’s like saying AI relationships can replace real relationships—they can’t. You’re still missing the point. Anything worth having requires effort and struggle, and without that, there’s no growth, satisfaction, or real value.",

She turns you down. You may make it about yourself when she might be a lesbian for all we know.\n\nHere is another way to look at it.\n\nSay you are a straight guy.  A lonely gay guy approaches you, when you turns him down he may make it about himself when in fact the truth may be that you were actually flattered by the approach, only you are not gay.\n\nThere is a saying which goes like *overnight success actually took many years to reach.*\n\nThis means most people believe in magic bullets;\n\n- apply for a job once and get it.\n\n- approach a person once and connect\n\n- try a business once and succeed\n\nYou get the idea?\n\nTruth is everything in life is like a movie. The 1hr 30min movie they show us is what we think life should be.\n\nAnd the behind the scene video which is thousands and thousands of hrs long, the real life we ALL experience.\n\nThat is the numbers game I am talking about. For everyone you see in a relationship, they were rejected more than you could count. \n\nSuccess is actually not the key to any relationship, failure is. This means to get success, the trick is to seek failure.\n\nThink about it. You can't be in a relationship with anyone who comes into your life. that means you have to search the right one.\n\nOf course they are always there but how do you know them?\n\nImagine entering a stadium looking for someone whom you don't have their phone number.\n\nYou have 3 options;\n\nFirst, you could give up, the task is daunting\n\nSecond, you could ask the first person and hope fate makes it the exact person you are looking for.\n\nThird, the hard road. Go through everyone who look similar to the person (you find attractive). Yes, some will spit in your face, some insult you, but eventually...",

I don't see anyone I've met from school, nor do I speak to them via social media despite having them added. I graduated school in May 2023 as well. This what I suspected in my Sophomore year, but I still gave it ago. The people I met, the few experiences I had were great, but ultimately they meant nothing, as I am completely alone for the first time in my life. The only people I interact with are family/coworkers. Meeting a woman outside of school/college is near impossible, since I barely see women my age and if I do, they most likely aren't opened to being approached. With friendships, sure if I try hard enough maybe it's possible, but I've no reason to believe it'll last. It really sucks being so lonely ",

One teaching stood out to me, “the first 15 years of your life is based on karma from a previous life and the next 15 is based on karma you earned,” or something to that affect.    Why did it stick with me? I was 31 at the time. I blamed my parents for my struggles and upbringing. At 18, I “ran away to the army.” Once out of the army, i dealt with PTSD, had many failed relationships, thought myself as awkward, financially illiterate, cheated on partners, failed and dropped out of school, couldn’t keep a steady job, all around made bad decisions and was a terrible human being. I went into a deep depression in my early 30s. I drank two bottles of wine every night and smoked blunts daily for at least 4-6 years. It was safe and easy to remain the same and to keep blaming my parents when I was in my early to mid 30s. The kicker was that I hadn’t lived with my parents since I was 18. I was influenced by my upbringing, but ultimately my current bad decisions and life difficulties are mine. I have no one else to blame but myself. It took a lot of time and effort to recognize that I am not bound by my circumstances. I sought help and am rebuilding my life, one baby step at a time. I wish I had done it sooner and I hope you do too. Best of luck.",

Despite my hard work (I have a cousin who said I’m the bravest socially anxious person she knows) I can’t shake off that fear around people, which affects even my network abilities, I can’t make myself grow and become attractive to men, lonliness is very tough when it’s been a majority of your life especially even when your own family is toxic. Well intentions but your response is quite hurtful. Why? Because it’s very minimizing, not everyone is the same or has the same circumstances of affected by the trauma the same. It’s like when rich people tell a single mom whose poor “well just work hard”. It comes across as super insensitive. No two people or two circumstances are the same but people shouldn’t be so insensitive as to assume “everyone is like me”. This group is supposed to be a safe place for people like me, it’s not supposed to be destroyed for us. If my thoughts don’t flap it’s because I’m quite upset. Because I’m tired of this attitude from normies that we are all the same and with the same amount of hard work we can all have the same successful results. This is my one safe place.",

Women rate 80% of men below average, where men's ratings of women were a perfect bell curve. \n\nIf you look to message rates on dating apps, the most attractive and successful men with the highest rated profiles recieved as much attention from women as a slightly above average woman (6/10) would recieve from men. The women rated 7/10 and above recieved 50%‐150% more messages than 10/10 rated men. Women are forced to be more selective based off the volume of disproportionate attention they receive. \n\nIn terms of traditional dating, women typically want a man who will have:\n- The confidence to approach\n- Charisma to lead conversation\n- Financial success and stability to provide\n- Strength to protect \n- Experience to plan good dates\n- Natural leadership skills or overall status. \n\nWomen usually date up. They want a man that is funnier than them, more confident than them, and more financially successful than them. OP specifically states in her post that she is NOT attracted to men like her. \n\nMen date down or typically don't care about those same prerequisites women have. \n\nMen typically want a loyal woman with some sort of purity. That's it.\n\nWomen initiate divorce in 70% of marriages. That number increases to 90% when focusing on only college educated women. \n\nTo put things in perspective, would you, as a woman, ever consider settling down and starting a family with, for example, a  Burger King frycook? Probably not, but never in my life have I heard of a man who wouldn't consider the inverse. \n\nThis is not supposed to be some big gotcha, women should ABSOLUTELY be more selective than men when it comes to dating simply because of the life altering implications that can potentially follow. But to think men are more selective than women in dating is truly asinine.",

Go to the gym and see how many women are wearing those bubble butt yoga pants with a normal bust size, go to the beach and see hot women in bikinis, men will pick the hottest women to date and sleep with. No way in hell have I ever been able to even be in the race, forget the finish line.",

In the biological context (some may say \"chemistry\") it's the genetic and immunological compatibility that matters.

In other words, you want to spend time with them because you *like* something about them. Without the initial interest no relationship could be formed. So even before any improvement can be commenced, the people have to have something *attractive*. That means not affected by [lack of] improvement - immutable.\n\nI will try to come back with more ideas if you are not bored or disgusted by the above.",

Most people just feel too awkward telling you how awkward you are despite claiming to be your ‘best friend’. I agree, our lack of social skills need severe work, at least for most of us here. However, as well intention as your comment is, it is a bit minimizing, like how normies make us feel. Imagine being so poor at math and telling yourself that you’ll get by without a tutor but then when you get a tutor, you do so much better. Many of us here are the way we are because we have missed out on socialization growing up, at least a decent amount if not completely, socialization is best learned as a child just as language acquisition is because that is when your brain is developing. If you don’t have enough social exposure to have a decent amount of skills (luckily I had basics due to being exposed to family, relatives, family friends but it wa still bad since I didn’t socialize much as kid), coupled with nobody to help you, you will continuously feel, just as if you are a bad at math and don’t get a tutor. It’s easy to tell someone that this is the way to be more positive but when that way is unattainable, life really brings you down, especially as your age. We are not born out of the womb negative. Rejection, socially, romantic, even in the workplace, the loneliness, etc., etc. It all gets to you after a while, especially when we live in a social world. I know you mean well, but I can see why someone downvoted you.  I understand a lot of the people on this sub complaint and don’t even try to help themselves. But I am telling you, that this is coming from someone who has really tried to work on her self socially, and even to dress better to fit in. However, it can only improve so much because it’s a circle. When you have social anxiety, you can only make so many friends outside of your comfort zone who will look beyond that, so you don’t get a whole lot of practice to get out of it. I got some in college, but not as much as I needed it of course. And like I said, you can’t make up for you what you missed out on your developmental years. It’s like, how homeschool kids are awkward. I remember trying to explain to my aunt, who was a therapist for God sake. And finally, she just gave up and said “ you can only work with the opportunities you have” . I was literally trying to tell her that those aren’t enough. If it worked out for you great. Us human beings don’t live in a bubble and positive experiences create a positive mindset. The sub is the only place where we can openly talk about our bitterness, our pain, our loneliness, and how we are treated above feeling this way.",

I go out for school, work, shopping, running errands, walks/hikes etc. being cooped up in my room too long gets me restless, so I enjoy the routine if anything.\n\n“You must have high standards, settle for a girl in your league” \n\nI have very low physical standards, Regardless, women in my league seem equally uninterested in me. \n\n“You must be a misogynist”\n\nI’m not? It’s hard to disprove this because people are going to believe what they want to believe. I’ll say that I’m not just looking for sex, but genuine love so it would be pretty strange for me to hate the people I am so desperately seeking love from.\n\n“You don’t try hard enough”\n\nI’m sorry that after years of social ostracism I’m not motivated to lower my guard and put myself out there. I’m terrified of rejection, and with someone like me it isn’t an irrational fear but pretty much a forgone conclusion. \n\nThese are just on the top of my head. The concept of someone just not being physically desirable enough simply escapes some people. I’ve even had friends make some of these assumptions about me whenever the topic has come up. I don’t want to address the main issue with them, as I feel complaining about being ugly comes across as validation seeking. Of course I won’t pretend I’m a saint and I certainly have issues beyond my appearance but I’m sick of people immediately jumping to conclusions. Too many people simply cannot fathom any other reason for being FA other than you being a shitty person. \n",

Or not perhaps a return, because nothing would be different, but rather a timeline in which earlier years were completely different. I used to just wish to go back to my mid 20's. Then as time wore on and I missed out on more and more of life, I fantasized about a different experience in my college years. As of recent, I dig further into past and can't help but helplessly romanticize a teenage experience that was the opposite of what mine actually was.\n\nI used to think I missed the boat out of FA life when I was a few years out of college, but now I realize that the issues that I face in and out of it were the same ones that were persistent throughout, well really my entire life, but critically, during high school.\n\nI'm spending my Friday night in a library trying to be busy so that I don't have to spend another Friday evening completely alone in my apartment. I'm surrounded by teenagers of various ages and I can't help but feel a mournful rage for what was stolen from me by an unrelenting anxiety. They're all studying and hanging out (how they can do both is beyond me - it's a very wealthy area so I know they're all taking difficult classes) having fun and laughing. There's some couples of course. Giggling and just enjoying life. One of them left to go get Starbucks and came back. How nice that must be to have someone to...well honestly just do fucking anything with.\n\nThere's so much that's lost if your high school experience is. I grew up in a very toxic religious and anxious environment, so a lot of basic human experiences and thoughts were made to feel taboo and dangerous to me. Sexuality especially. During the years where you are supposed to be experimenting and being interested in flirting and dating and getting some physical experience, I was brainwashed into thinking these ideas were signs that you were morally distorted. But now, looking around at these people and hearing what they're whispering about, it really set in that even the most shy looking people have the same urges as everyone else. Carnal desires, maybe even taboo desires. Things that their parents would not want to hear about. The difference between them? When I was there age, my controlling parents really convinced me and my siblings that disappointing them would result in a lack of love and care from them, so even these types of thoughts were things we became afraid of.\n\nThose years NEVER come back. You can try to recreate them or the experiences that you are supposed to have during them, but it will never be the same. Whatever benefits they give you will only be a dim replication of what your soul truly was crying out for at that time. Milestones exist for a reason and if you miss enough of them, you eventually find yourself completely off of the path of normalcy and the more you try to find your way back, the more you find yourself increasingly lost.",

I say this because I noticed the advice that people give me is either comes from condescension, lacking understanding about my situation, and having no empathy. I'll give you example, sometimes when I post I get people telling me that I'm not entitled to a relationship (That's like saying to somebody who's dehydrated that they're not entitled to water.), I get people telling me that I am desperate (as if I'm not going through life being completely alone so I'm going to idolize friendships/relationships), I have people telling me that I need to be self-confident (as if that deletes the need for a community), sometimes I even get people asking me why do I care what other people think (and when people say this they completely ignored the fact that these people spread rumors about me so not only do I have to worry about being bullied by one person I have to worry about being jumped by multiple different people). I even had one person coming to my DM's asking me if I wanted male attention, just because I come online as a woman and I talk about being lonely it doesn't mean you have to treat me like someone who throw themselves at every jack and jill that gives me attention. You don't have to speak down at me, I got standards too believe it or not. I'm starting to feel like all the advice or the lectures that people try to give me (especially the ones where I didn't ask for advice) is almost designed to not help me but to make me feel frustrated and misunderstood. I never understood why married people or people who have never struggled with having absolutely no friends or being bullied every single day of their lives think that they can speak over someone like me. I'm not asking people not have their opinions I just really wish they knew their  audience before giving out advice. The only thing that is working for me right now is body neutrality, accepting that I might not be the most likable person because I am fundamentally different, and going out with family and friends every chance I get. Does anyone else feel this way?",

It just makes me think there's something about my personality that's lacking to the point nobody wants to stay around despite how much i try. All my dating attempts can be summarized as: meet someone who has similar interests or hobbies and we talk for a while there seems to be a lot of mutual interest I think I finally find the one -> they slowly lose interest in me or just ghost me before we even go out, not giving me an opportunity to find out what went wrong \n\nAm I just too boring or uninteresting? Or is it just as superficial as my appearance? I really don't know and I probably won't ever find out because I've lost all hope in finding love or romance at this point.",

Recently I was set-up with this girl by a mutual friend. I really really wanted it to work out, our mutual friend was really excited about it and she was very attractive, much more than the girls I usually match with on dating apps. We went out a few times, and we got on but I feel like I was really awkward, and I was too nervous to go through with much of anything romantically. \n\nAfter the third time we saw each other she got very quiet and slow in her replies, and even though I kept trying to arrange something she kept cancelling. Eventually as expected she said we’d be better as friends. Even though we barely knew each other I was pretty devastated. Feel like such a let down. I’ve since started using dating apps again but it’s back to me having zero luck. Either I have 0 matches or the girls I do message don’t reply. I feel like that was my one chance and I completely blew it by being awkward as fuck. Feeling pretty hopeless about my future prospects rn.",

Finally, she asked if I had any interest in getting married.\n\nI could have said anything, how every woman I’ve asked out either rejected me or strung me along. How my parents' toxic marriage destroyed any notion of a happy one. Or how I hate myself so much that even being with a woman might be toxic for her, which I promised myself I would never allow. But I couldn’t say anything. I just looked at her, and after ten minutes, she dropped the topic and moved on to something else.\n\nGod, I hate myself.",

And that encompasses many deeply held values that will always work against me in every way possible.\n\nYou're allowed to lean right and be straight. You're allowed to lean left and be straight. You're allowed to lean left and be gay. Under absolutely no circumstances are you allowed to lean right and be gay. \n\nThe acid that gets spit in my face when guys I meet learn about this is astounding. I may as well be telling them I'm an actual Nazi sympathizer. I have my reasons and none of them are rooted in hate, but I'm so tired of explaining myself that I just straight up say I'm not getting into it. At that point they'll draw their own conclusions and I say let them. If it's such an issue then it's already over anyway. \n\nAs if that's bad enough, I'm religious. I attend church. It doesn't really get any deeper than that, I'm not going on missions, I'm not taking part in activities, I just go to church on Sunday. Once a week for an hour. It just feels like cleansing my soul. I have absolutely zero requirements for a potential partner to also be religious or become religious for me, but still, I find myself being challenged on this, and once again, I'm no longer interested in explaining myself. \n\nI have the freedom to whatever political opinions I may have and the freedom to worship however I please. Yet gay men think I don't have these freedoms and I'm in the wrong by exercising them. I'm name called, insulted, ostracized, and generally treated poorly over them. \n\nI get it. I'm an outlier. Something that the gay community has decided is inexcusable. I was raised in a rural lifestyle, on a farm where the pavement ends, on a dirt road. By parents who love me. Parents who know I'm gay and love and support me, despite their religious and political beliefs being hated by people like me. It was a simple life. For most of my childhood I had no social media, not even internet access. In those days, all we had was dial up internet and our use of it was limited. If I wanted entertainment, I went outside. I'd play in the old trucks, the barn, I'd play with the cats or in the sandbox. We had a Nintendo 64 if I felt like I wanted a little screen time but even then I couldn't waste a whole day on it. Even where I went to school, there were few to no other gay kids. It was me and one other I knew of, and we would never be attracted to eachother. I love my rural upbringing, he renounced his. We'd grow up to go in completely separate directions. Even so, I wasn't part of the \"in crowd.\" I didn't go with the football or volleyball team to other schools. I just played my piano and drew my pictures. So I didn't even have the opportunity to explore romantically and sexually then.\n\nI was also raised religious. Never in an overbearing way though, in more of a due diligence kind of way. Go, listen, try to learn something. Try to let it make you a better person. I got away from it at one time, but it left a void so I went back. It's been a source of comfort for me ever since. I talk to God often, I don't ask for things because I don't believe in divine intervention, at least not anymore, but just when I feel like I need someone to listen.\n\nIn addition to these beliefs, I was also raised to believe sex is sacred. It's something to be shared with someone you love, when the time is right. Not something to give out to anybody and everybody, or treated with little to no value. \n\nNow I'm a grown up and still adhere to these beliefs. Not because I was programmed to, but because I truly believe in them. My parents raised me to make my own decisions, not to just do something or believe something just because they told me to. Yet now I'm finding I'm thrust into a commutity which I'm forced to try to date in where I don't get that option, the option to believe what I want. I'm told I have to believe what others like be believe or my beliefs are wrong.\n\nI'm basically the opposite of what's allowed. I could count on one hand the number of men I've met who genuinely shared my beliefs and didn't wind up challenging me or just flat out hating me over them, but there was always something in the way. Sometimes they're old enough to be my dad which I'm not comfortable with, sometimes they exhibited behaviors I considered to be red flags, sometimes they lived a thousand of miles away, etc. Even when I got to the door, it was still locked.\n\nThough I still remain attached to my roots, I now live in a city. At 31 years old, it's been 13 years since I officially put myself out there and started trying to date. I told myself a long time ago that all of my deeply held beliefs are going to do nothing but work against me. It's been nearly impossible to find like minded men as a result and the changes I'd have to make, I'm not willing to. Nobody should have to fight against their own instincts to appease someone else. \n\nI've hunkered down for many years alone. I still look but I've tightened my enforcement of my standards. I don't give out multiple chances, if a guy blows it, he's out. And the thing is....I'm fine. Honestly, yes. I sometimes long for that feeling of butterflies, I've longed for that touch, I've longed for that look that you get from someone who you're everything to, I've longed to be taken to that place...that beautiful place of euphoria with the only person I'd ever want to go there with.\n\nBut inside, I know the hand I've been dealt. It's very poor. I know it's not about the hand, it's about how you play, but sometimes the hand is so bad you can't play your way out of it. You just keep losing, over and over again. I'm prepared to keep losing. It's all I know how to do. Maybe one day I'll get that hand, that hand that's unmistakable. The one that nobody, not even the most foolish person, could ever possibly screw up playing. Until then, I'm just gonna keep playing the game how it is. From a position of complete and total disadvantage.\n\nI just go out and live my stupid little life, looking forward to the same routine. Anticipating my stupid trivial Amazon orders, going to visit my grandma, and Sundays when I go to Mass then go do my errands afterward. Getting in line at the coffee shop to have my weekly treat, a good cup of coffee, and hoping I'll catch the eye of a cute guy and we'll hit it off and I'll have get that stupid little romance we all dream of. One without Tinder. Organic.\n\nBut for now, I just go on. Down the same old dirt road my life has been on. The one I was born on and will probably die on. Seeing that double lane silky smooth highway to the side of me with cars blowing past at twice my speed. Wondering if I'll ever reach an approach that'll let me get on there before I run out of gas. But I don't mind the dirt road. \n\nReminds me of home.",

Of course, it's still super awkward because it's illegal in the Ukraine, but the whole idea of paying for hugs and getting hugs in return in a clear fashion seems much more sensible than any socialisation which in turn might never even be properly consensual or clear-cut?\n\nAfter all, in normal relationships, you will mostly likely get cheated on, but an escort can never cheat on you because she's beyond such categories.\n\nThe only danger could be getting an emotional attachments, but some customers do attend the same escort once in a while, judging by the reviews I've seen, so it's not too weird.\n\nAlso, while it might be not that often, turning sex into a routine could be a danger, so keeping things fresh isn't even that bad.\n\n(Apologies for the write-up, nobody's gonna read this, should probably have written it in my own thread, oopsie.)",

The skewed distribution of likes women provide, however, resembles that of Tinder: about 16% of women’s likes go to the top 1% of men, about 41% of their likes go to the top 5% of men, 58% of their likes go to the top 10%, and almost 96% of their likes go to the top 50%.

I try to change I take advice from many people but It always ends pretty bad for me there’s something in me that’s fundamentally broken I guess, something that a lot of other people have but I just don’t. I’ve done what I was supposed to do, at least that’s what I thought, they told me to start to be more talkative I did that but it ends up with people talking behind my back calling me obnoxious, so I became quiet of course I spoke here and there but not nearly as much as I used to. But even so, now people call me a weirdo? They ask why I even came if I won’t talk? I’m basically invisible to people but when I’m not I’m a nuisance to them. And the worst part about it? Like I said I have no excuse for this nothing is wrong with me yet something is wrong with me, I feel like I don’t deserve what I have because other people have to struggle and yet unlike the average person that I supposedly am I mess up can’t get into any relationships and end up with people hating me because something is wrong with me.  And on top of that it seems like if you’re not in a relationship that’s weird, People around me talk like it’s the norm yet I struggle this much my parents question me saying at this point there’s no way I can’t have a girlfriend and that maybe there’s something wrong with me, well I agree with them but I don’t know what it is or how I can fix or change it. I’ve done so much to change who I am, but what I realize is that I want someone who only cares about who I am but that’s nearly impossible seeing as their is nothing  interesting about my personality. So yeah, I want to be ugly because being the way I am now doesn’t help and it hurts my stupid fragile heart when I realize that everyone else has no problems. If I was ugly It would be the norm not to be able to get into relationships so I wouldn’t have to worry about pleasing people, so I could just be left alone in despair. I hate myself now but I feel like if I was ugly I wouldn’t because I was born that way, it wasn’t in my favor anyways so theirs no reason to be sad whereas now I’m just feel horrible because I see how ugly people talk about how they wish they were at least average and I am yet my life still sucks, feels like I’m wasting my life and ruining someone else’s by doing nothing with it.\n\nTl;dr- I wish I was ugly because then I have an excuse to be such a loser at life.",

It feels like a secret people I've tried asking out and everyone else is aware of, yet is lying to me. Being ugly would kind of be an obvious answer that would finally quench the continuous thoughts.   \n  \nYes, it's a really shitty way to think, especially to those that have things like facial deformities, and I acknowledge that. But I guess we're both looking for a quick way to end fruitless hope. Even if the solution is painful.",

Like, I can see everyone around me engaging with things I can’t quite access yet—intimacy, romance, even just casual touch. But it’s like I’m watching it through a glass, feeling the warmth but never quite reaching it. There’s a distance between what I want and what I can have, a gap that feels wider every time I try to cross it.\n\nI wonder if everyone else feels this way. If they’re just better at pretending they’re not. But I can’t help but feel like I’m behind in some way—like I missed the boat on learning how to share those moments of closeness without overthinking them. And now I’m stuck in this cycle, wondering how much of this is just in my head and how much of it is real. The sexual longing, the desire for touch, the intimacy I crave—it all feels so intense and yet so distant.\n\nI want those experiences. I want to feel that natural flow of connection with someone. The kind that happens when you’re not overanalyzing every touch or word or moment. But every time I think I’m getting closer, I feel like I’m just pushing against the walls of my own limitations. Like I’m trying to catch something that’s always just out of reach.\n\nMaybe I’m chasing something I can’t have right now, and I just need to learn to let it come to me when the time is right. But, damn, it’s hard when the thing you want feels like it’s always slipping through your fingers.",

No meth for me, thank you....\n\nI don't even know where to start, but yesterday, she told me I was always down, and that if I feel like life’s too hard, I should just end it. She said it so angrily over a short voice message. This is the same person I thought I could trust. She was the only person I had left in real life, the one I tried to be there for, no matter what. Every time she was down, I was always there, never once complained, even when she lied to me. Even when the lies were obvious, I didn’t want to see the red flags.... 🚩🚩🚩\n\nBut once I started questioning the truth, she just snapped. She criticized me and told me, over and over, to kill myself she doesn't give a shit. When I needed her the most, she wasn't there for me. Every time she needed anything, babysitting, a listening ear whatever, I was there in a heartbeat, but when I needed something? She was too busy, or there was \"no time right now.\" What kind of \"friend\" does that?\n\nI don’t know how to process this. Even though she’s hurt me so deeply, I still have things in my apartment that remind me of her, memories that used to mean something. We shared moments I’ll never forget. But now, when I think back, I can’t even be sure if she was ever truly happy in those moments, or if she was just pretending for the pictures...\n\nShe’s been using meth yeah that Breaking Bad stuff for a while now, and I honestly don’t even recognize the person she’s become. How could someone change this much? I feel like I could cry, and honestly, I want to. I thought I found someone I could rely on, but in the end, she’s not who I thought she was.\n\nAll I want now is to feel cared for. To be held by someone who makes me feel like I’m not alone. But right now, all I feel is the pain of losing someone I thought was my friend, and the loneliness\n\nOnce we were out at a party with other people she knew, and she was nearly hit by a car. We talked about it afterward, and if she had taken one more step, she would’ve been dead, getting hit by a car going about 60 km/h (around 40 mph). It would have almost been a deadly accident, and she wasn’t even phased. I don’t know what it was, maybe the meth she was on, but she didn’t even care. \n\n  \nThen we were out for a party another time, and she was like, \"Want to try some snorting, some meth?\" I was always like, \"No thanks,\" but after her asking like five times, I just pretended to snort it so she would shut the fuck up. At that point, I knew all I wanted was a friendship, but not like this. A friendship like that means nothing. Literally. She’s a great mother to her child and so on, and her husband, well, I feel sorry for him. No matter what he does, she criticizes him. I would literally rather have no wife than this. I guess this marriage is worse than being lonely by a hundred times.",

                "text_body": "**Sorry, this turned out to be a long post. But thank you if you take the time to read it, I appreciate it. =)**\n\nSomething that has bothered me for as long as I can remember is judgemental people. Maybe it's because, when I was a kid, I was pretty different. A lot less \"typically masculine\" than a lot of my peers. Like I didn't like sports or rough play, I liked stories and intellectual pursuits, etc. And, as you can imagine, there had been times that I got bullied or judged for that. I suspect that this made me someone who is fundamentally very against judgement, and this is also why I try my best in most cases, though not always successfully, to not rush to judgements about other people. But it seems to me that a lot of people do rush to judgements. And there's one specific type of judgement I want to talk about today: The judgement of people who are not single by choice.\n\nToday I just happened across a video on Youtube which was meant to be \"satirical.\" And in this video a woman acts in an obviously sexist and obnoxious way while simultaneously blaming everyone else for being single. I think we can all guess what was being referenced here.\n\nNow, in itself you could argue this video isn't a real judgement. Because presumably those kinds of toxic people do exist and you could argue it was only making fun of those people specifically, and not everyone who is single against their will. And that's fair enough. But to me it comes across as being part of a larger pattern.\n\nI frequently go on the r/amiugly sub. The reason I do this is because I have body dysmorphia and so I am deeply insecure about my own appearance, which gives me great sympathy for other people who are very insecure about their appearance. I never want people to feel like I feel about myself often, so I go on there and compliment people who are feeling insecure. I never lie because I do think it's important to be honest to people, but what I do in fact do is just not comment on anyone I think isn't at least somewhat pretty. Not because I don't want to boost their self-esteem, I do, but just because I don't want to lie either.\n\nAnyway, because I visit that place pretty often, I see a lot of comments. And there is one type of comment that I see over and over and over again. When someone is at least somewhat attractive, they will often get the reply like \"It's not your looks, must have a bad personality.\" And, of course, when OP responds to that negatively they almost always get dogpiled and people take their negative reaction as \"proof\" of their bad personality.\n\nOr when people talk about romantic loneliness on the internet sometimes. Some people can be understanding. But I very often see people who are instantly hostile. Making cruel jokes and just saying cruel things, it seems to me justified in their minds by them just assuming that the person must be romantically lonely because they're a toxic person.\n\nAnd whenever I see it happening, it bothers me. Because these people, who are already in a vulnerable place, are being harmed even more. And for no reason other than people rushing to judgement.\n\nNow, to be clear, there absolutely are people who are toxic and single against their will. There are people who are sexist, and hateful, and obnoxious, and all of those things who are single. Maybe they're single because of those things, or maybe they became those things because they were single. But either way, they do exist and I don't want to deny that. And obviously they tend to be the people who get the most attention on the internet because social media algorithms promote outrage and feed on anger.\n\nBut while those people do exist, that doesn't justify the idea that JUST because someone is single against their will they MUST be a sexist, obnoxious person with a terrible personality.\n\nIt feels like many people just jump to that conclusion though. That if you are single against your will and lonely, that must mean that it's either that you're ugly or you just have a bad personality (and therefore it's okay to be cruel when they're vulnerable). As if all of dating is just about those two things. But of course this isn't true.\n\nPeople who are autistic and struggle with social cues might find it hard. People who have social anxiety and find it hard to meet new people might find it hard. People who struggle with severe depression and can barely leave their beds, let alone be an exciting presence in someone else's life. People who struggle with body dysmorphia who are too insecure about their appearance to risk dating. People who are poor and have to work a lot. People who are just plain unconventional in their behaviour and appearance but in a completely harmless way.\n\nAll of these people can be good, kind, loving people and yet at the same time still struggle a LOT with finding a partner. And with romantic loneliness.\n\nAnd I think there are an increasing number of people who just don't seem to be willing to accept that. Who just assume you're a bad person if you're single against your will and lonely.\n\nI suspect part of it is heuristics, mental shortcuts people take, which in this case basically goes something like \"all cars are transportation, so all transportation must be cars.\" A logical mistake.\n\nI think part of it is just that social media bombards them with videos like what I mentioned and often rewards cruel jokes.\n\nPart of it I think is something called the \"fundamental attributional error.\" Where people tend to attribute their own successes to internal factors and failures to external factors, while they tend to attribute other people's successes to external factors and failures to internal factors. You can look this up, it's a concept from psychology.\n\nAnd I think part of it is just the \"just world fallacy.\" Which is basically the idea that some people have that the world operates justly. That people always get what they deserve. If you're poor it's because you're lazy , if you got scammed you must be stupid, if you are lonely and struggling it must be because you're obnoxious and sexist. And the real world just doesn't work that way. Awful people can live successful and happy lives, incredibly kind and loving people can end up in a ditch somewhere alone. It's just easier to think that bad things happen only to bad things, because then maybe bad things won't happen to you.\n\nBut the world isn't fundamentally just. The world doesn't operate on giving people what we deserve. The only thing that can make the world just, is us. And how we treat others. By not rushing to judgements and being kind and understanding of people who are vulnerable.",

It’s like if we don’t have any luck no matter what we do, Then we are forced to go through experiences where others definitely make us feel unloved and try to make us feel inferior like we are third class citizens because we don’t have a partner AT LEAST YET….",

And it barely even counts because they technically met in high school and then reconnected at the gym years later when he was there with his friends, who were also hers.  I wouldn't even consider working out a hobby honestly.\n\n2.  **Hobbies are not a viable substitute to experiencing normal life experiences.**  The common notion is that to distract yourself from your loneliness and the fact that you're missing out on basic developmentally crucial experiences, you should simply bury yourself in hobbies.  Forget the fact that if you're depressed, eventually you'll experience anhedonia and find the circle of things that you are able to find interest in constantly dwindling, eventually they simply become a coping mechanism and far enough down the line, it becomes similar to escaping through drugs and alcohol.  When ALL you have are \"hobbies\", you'll be pissing away time and money in an unhealthy manner just in an attempt to distract yourself from reality.\n\n  \n3.  **Most people don't have any actual hobbies**.  How many people do you know actually are passionate about something that they engage with?  I'm not talking netflix or eating out, or any other passive activity.  Most people don't develop strong devotion towards one hobby or activity because they're busy experiencing life like a buffet.  A little of this, a little of that.  The way life is supposed to be.

If they can name any, I would bet that there's a 90% chance that whatever they say, it will be something passive, essentially just a time sink.\n\n  \nI'm not saying that you should not have any of your own, I think they can be great, but the reality is that a very small percentage of the population has any interest in any hobby (one of the most overused words) outside of watching tv, scrolling social media, and gossiping.  They're busy living life in a way that we are locked out of.",

Like they think about these things all the time. I just don't see how you truly believe most people do not have anything they care about.\n\nAlso, you say that some of these are just a \"time sink.\" i.e. they are just watching a movie. But people who like movies love movies dude. they want to make movies; they want to discuss movies. Every week they are looking at the new movies coming up ready to watch and discuss them with their friends.\n\nThats the whole point of the advice. It's easier to make friends with people who share a similar interest with you. It's way easier to start making friends with someone who loves gaming if I love gaming. Conversations and questions flow easier. Sure, not every single person you're going to talk to is going to click with you but it's a hell of a lot easier than trying to make friends with a random person that you have nothing in common with.\n\nMost people I meet who do not have hobbies are people who work too much since they have no time for them. I'm not saying the advice will work for everyone or even that its great advice but it's better than just approaching people on the street randomly.",

People who enjoy the same hobby. The thing is it's almost impossible to do that with untreated depression, believe me I know.\n\nYou have to manage the depression first, that could include, medication, therapy, working out, and/or a solo hobby but that's a hobby for YOU. Once you have your depression managed (as best as you can) then you can hopefully explore activities involving other people.\n\nIt's at this point you're looking for a hobby that involves people. This is where the meeting people starts. Remember in your example you thought if you asked people what their hobbies were they wouldn't have any? Well, if you picked up a hobby to help manage your depression YOU have an answer to that question when people ask YOU. And maybe they're into it too, or know someone who is (or not) but it's a conversation starter.\n\nThis is daunting as hell when you're looking at it from the beginning but it's a path worth following.\n\nI'm at the stage where I think my depression and anxiety are managed so I'm looking for things to do that involve other people.

You can see it in the comments in this thread. Some people say playing a guitar is a hobby, but watching sports or movies isn’t. Others say watching sports or movies is a hobby, but only if you engage with them in a certain way. Others say they aren’t because they’re passive: you need to actually be actively doing something, like making movies or playing sports, as you would actively play a guitar or compete jiu-jitsu for it to “count” as a hobby. Some people say reading is a hobby (most, in fact, I’d say), but I’ve seen people say it’s not really a hobby but just something everyone does or can do. What about watching TV or Netflix? Are those hobbies? Does it depend on how you engage with them?\n\nMy point is that the idea of “hobbies” is more complex than what may meet the eye. So, if you struggle with this advice, or with developing or understanding hobbies, that could be partially why. The simple truth is that what “counts” as a “valid” hobby is going to be different for different people. In other words, hobbies mean something different to different people.\n\nI personally think it’s helpful to think less about “getting a hobby,” and more about “getting an interest,” or “getting interested in something/or things.” You don’t have to develop an obsessive passion with a particular topic like a professor, but just cultivating an interest in some topic, subject, or activity. You’ll find that you will actively engage with anything that you are really interested in, or developing an interest in, even if it’s relatively passive compared to other “active” hobbies. Once you have interests and work on them, you’ll find some that go hand-in-hand with a corresponding hobby or similar hobbies.",

Want to talk about the brilliance of DW Griffith’s film-making in contrast to his horrid subject matter? I’m your guy. Can’t tell you how many times women that were interested in film brushed me aside for a cuter guy who simply said, “Hello.”\n\nI remember talking about existentialist novels with a woman at a bar. Another guy came over, barely said anything and with minutes she was practically pawing at him. What did they have in common? Nothing. Wait, no. That’s wrong. What they had in common was attraction.\n\nYeah, hobbies are great. I adore my hobbies. However, if someone isn’t attracted in the first place, your hobbies don’t mean a damn thing.",

I started reading Norwegian Wood by Murakami and it happened literally in the first chapter.\n\nThe main character was experiencing intense nostalgia for a girl he loved as a young adult, and realizing that I don't even have anything to be nostalgic about broke me down and made me cry. As a 29yo kissless virgin I have 0 relationship experience, 0 romantic experience, 0 memories.\n\nThere were a handful of girls I liked, and think about them from time to time, but even then - there was nothing there. It's more in the realm \"what could have been?\", than anything of actual substance.\n\nReality is that the answer to that question is nothing. If it could have been, it would have been. No point in empty coping. Call me crazy, but I think that pain would be preferable over nothingness.\n\nAnyways, I'm writing this because I regret not actually trying more when I was younger. I always had some excuse, some fear, something to \"fix\" first, and here I'm now.\n\nI finally did the work, fixed (most) the stuff I wanted to fix, and for what? To make compromises for women who never did and never would do the same for me? So I could be safe/smart option for women looking to settle down after \"having their fun\"? Yea...I ain't about that life.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the work I put in was absolutely worth it in a personal sense. My confidence is iron clad, I'm the best I've ever been, and I would even say that I've genuinely reached a point where I'm content with staying single, but I won't delude myself into thinking I'm better of then if I had someone to love.\n\nThere is no doubt that there are plenty of younger guys here following the same path I walked on, so I want to warn you, as I would have warned my younger self if I could talk to him.\n\nFuck the excuses, fuck the anxiety, fuck the fear of rejection, fuck trying to avoid discomfort. Trust me, there is no rejection and there is no loss as painful as regret of wasting your life.\n\nIt may or may not be too late for me, but I see so many guys here giving up at the age I would give anything to go back to. I remember thinking it was over for me at 25, heck even sooner, but looking back, if I could go back to that age with the mentality, confidence and knowledge I have today, by now, I would have been married and have kids, instead of being in the position I am.\n\nEh, it is what it is. I may be beaten and bruised, but I'm not giving up, even if my chances look pretty bad right now. If nothing else, at least I won't have regrets in the future. I'll try to improve and hope for the best.\n\nThanks for reading, and good luck!",

That's pretty rad, action is naturally better than inaction or worse, regret and constantly self beating on yourself. Try your best to not let that consume about your younger self and what 'you would have done with your thoughts and insight now', you said yourself you're not here to settle or make unfair compromises the others at that stage period wouldn't have back. That's awesome. 👍\n\n\nKeep making actions, I believe you're doing something really neat with that.",

I never leave home unless I have to. I like my alone time too so if she's needy it'd never work.

I'm 25M, about to be 26 in less than two months...most people my age either are in a relationship or have had one in the past.  Some people in my age group are even married already.  And then there's me, with exactly zero relationship experience to show for all the years I've spent on this stupid rock.  I've never had a girlfriend, never been kissed, never been on a date...hell, I've never even had any girls show any semblance of romantic interest in me.  And as much as I've wanted to try to stay hopeful, it only seems more and more futile the more time passes.  If it hasn't happened by now, then why should I expect it to happen now?  Especially when I somehow made it this far in life without even one girl being interested enough in me to want to start a relationship with me.  Maybe it's just not in the cards for me.  It just feels impossible that after all the time I've been alive I couldn't even find one girl who wanted to be with me, especially when practically everyone else seems to be able to find love with no problem at all.  The only explanation I can think of is that it just isn't meant to be for me...why else would I not be able to succeed in experiencing such a wonderful part of human life that so many other people can accomplish without a second thought?  A tiny part of me still wants to hold out hope, but the rest of me thinks I'm just harboring delusions for something that's never gonna become a reality.  Hence my original question...is it even worth it to keep trying for the one-in-a-million chance that I'll somehow find a girl who actually likes me and finally wind up with a loving partner by my side?  Or should I just embrace the darkness and pull myself out of the game so I don't spend the rest of my life torturing myself for an unattainable dream?",

Everything in life is luck and chance based, treating it as like that's the golden rule is deeply dangerous because it'll build false hope and resentment inside for people who *do* feel romantic attraction and crave it, hoping it'll 'just happen'.\n\n\nTrust, it doesn't. That's just society's toxic romanticizing of romance, ironically. Until we can slowly chip away at it and shut down the idea of 'soulmates' to begin with, best anyone can do is correct any time someone does by reminding them people grow and outgrow things, even other people. No such thing as soulmates or a 'twin flame' or whatever people wanna call them else, there's just **people** in the world. Some people might want to try creating a relationship with another, that's a choice made based on multiple factors from how they meet, how they get along, and if their general ideals align. And that's *if* the chance arises for them to even meet in the first place *AND* at the right time.",

They don't have some magical ability to know something about someone, and can we stop pretending that them being interested or uninterested is some measure of what good and bad qualities another person has?",

I'm ugly (strabismus, scoliosis and one of my legs is a bit shorter than the other one) and women in real life are creeped out by my presence. Everything I'm getting from them are weird looks and insults. Nothing else. On social media apps I'm getting seen and block. On dating apps is the same, 0 matches. When it happens to get a match is either from an OF girl or a bot. I'm into tech, anime, manga, comics, walks in nature, a little cooking and repairing electronic things like phones, tablets, laptops and PCs. It seems like these hobbies are a no go and boring for most women. I do have a job and I do workout too but nothing changed to be honest. ",

Signed up for some activities, tried searching a job, started with some classes as well... Nothing. My head won't stop telling me I will never make it. Everyone just repeats to me that \"It will eventually come\" and that I need more self-confidence. How the hell am I going to have self-confidence when every single girl I've met in my entire life has rejected me? How am I going to have self-confidence when, despite my friends being also FAs, they at least got to experience it once, and me being a bit older than most of them, has never been able to? People tell me to just meet girls through friends but well, none of my friends know girls. \"Well, I guess I'll have to use dating apps\" And then everyone proceeds to tell me how shit they are and advice me to never use them. How do I find someone then? I'm so tired and I'm here trying to hold my tears while writing this and getting another \"It'll eventually come\". The thought of never finding someone makes me feel very sick inside. I just had to get everything out or else I was going to explode...",

I was on a campus tour a few days ago and they mentioned that you can search for roommates on social media when you apply for housing. It got me to thinking that if I had social media in high school I would have had more friends, been more popular, and have graduated high school not a virgin, but it's too late, it's almost over. My parents didn't let me have social media, but they don't understand that the only way to date and talk to women in high school is through Snapchat and Instagram. They were the picture perfect high school couple, Dad played football, mom was a cheerleader, they got married not too long after high school, then had me in their early 20's. I am the complete opposite, an autistic loser who has few friends, not involved in extracurriculars, and spent most of my teenage years not talking to people IRL because I was that one \"quiet kid\" and then after school turned around and became an insufferable edgelord online. I'm nothing like my parents. The few years where I had all that freedom and didn't have to pay bills and shit I wasted. High school is supposed to be the best time of your life, but for me, it was the second-worst time of my life, the only thing worse was middle school. I was a social outcast who was intentionally excluded from other people all because I didn't have social media, and now I can't do it over again because once I graduate I'll have to start paying bills and shit and won't have time to start dating, just doomed to be a lonely masturbator for the rest of my life. It's hard having the emotional intelligence of a 7th grader yet being 18 and about to enter adulthood. If only I had gotten in Snapchat in middle school would I not still be a virgin, and would have had some respect, but it's all over, and I can't do high school over again.",

Girls would reply to my snapchat story and call me ugly, screenshot my stories to then send around for me to only get made fun of the day after so I would dread going into school.\n\n Really fucked up my self esteem and to this day I don't post anything anymore because of the way they made me feel at school and I've then grown up to see myself as ugly. I receive compliments from my family and maybe an old customer who comes into work but it feels like pity compliments, almost like the world can see through my loneliness and see how broken I am so they pretend to be nice. I can't really explain it that well but I can tell it's not genuine, more like \"aw bless you, here's a fake compliment\". \n\nLike you, also on the spectrum, no friends and zero dating experience in school. I'm also nothing like my parents either who met at a nightclub, for me to grow up and hate those things so I feel safer and happier at home. Nothing but an isolated loser outside of my dead end job \n\nGood luck with further education and moving into college dorms. I never did further education and just graduated then went into work as I couldn't cope with the bullying and didnt want to put myself through it again during university. Oh and my lack of independence, being on the spectrum and always being a bit behind others I know I wouldn't be able to cope with so much responsibility. I've always felt so many years younger than I actually am. \n\nI can't relate to anyone my age whatsoever and I feel so embarrassed being in public, especially at work I feel so heavily judged by everyone. I was telling my coworker about one of my interests for her to say \"my son collects stupid things like that\", but then tried to play nice and say \"its good you do that, we all like what we like\", like no I heard you the first time. My interests are stupid to average people. Got it! \n\nI really can't imagine anyone wanting to be with me anyway which is why I almost flip flop out of being so active in this subreddit and then disappearing lol. I want nothing more than to feel good about myself and to stop hating myself so much, but then only step outside of my bubble and it all comes back again.. from work, to seeing friend groups, couples, valentines day, Christmas, halloween. Everything is extremely socialising orientated as thats what life is about. I do not have that but wish I did. I wish I was in a relationship, but also know how ugly I am (confirmed through high school experiences and life in general)",

Most people can't relate to to the idea of being constantly rejected by the opposite sex, even hated by them. I am not a virgin. I've had sex, but I've had frighteningly few relationships, and long dry spells. I've had women go out of their way to tell me they think I'm ugly. I haven't been with a woman in years.\n\n\nMost people simply can't relate to that. A lot of them still hook up young, get married and have kids. I've seen my own circle of friends decline as they all bow out and start families. I know that I'm a looser. I already earn less than my peers, I have less job stability.

I had zero friends after graduating from high school at age 17 and drifting away from my social group there, until 32 when I decided it was high time to stop overfocusing on my education/career and start developing a social life. As I push close to 40 now, I'm much happier with two sizable social circles, I've gotten laid a decent amount of times (still no Casanova), and I'm at least on the cusp of girlfriend territory right now (it's complicated).\n\nYou have to stop beating yourself up for being unsuccessful so far and realize it's not all on you. You're trying, but you can't force other people to give you a chance. All you can do is be your best self and keep meeting new people until you find your partner/tribe. And getting older, especially as a man, does help slightly. You're still mentally developing and still finding your footing as an adult in this world. You feel uninteresting because you simply haven't accumulated enough past life experiences to draw on yet. You haven't seen glimpses of success yet to encourage you keep going. But you're only 19. Only about half your peers have even lost their virginity yet, yet by age 25 over 90% will have. Statistically, you're very likely to be among them. The only thing you can't do is give up entirely, because if you give up then you seal your fate.\n\nThe biggest thing that helped me was developing that self-confidence, and it was after years of self-improvement effort *didn't* lead to better outcomes. I started at 32, but those first three years didn't bear much fruit. I got discouraged at first but the more I improved and the more boxes I checked, so to speak, the more I realized I wasn't the problem. Being able to let go of that aura of self-loathing really helped my mental state, and eventually the fearlessness to be brazenly open and honest and vulnerable with a sort of \"inner swagger\" to how I started conducting myself started to win people over.\n\nBut in the end, success is down to luck. All you can do is give yourself the best odds and more tries. Keep putting in effort to self-improve and put yourself out there. When you need a mental health break, take a step back and coast on minimum effort for a while until you're ready to hit the gas again. At your age, success will probably find yourself than later.",

I can't say I'm surprised, I've been on enough failed dates to know that I should always keep my expectations modest - after all, I am far from gifted in maintaining charm.\n\nI was getting along real well with this gal I met at my friend's party in late Jan, the second date actually went so well that we ended up sharing a kiss in my car at the end before I dropped her home. The third date was also nice albeit more tame than exciting.... but I got to kiss her again as we shared boba tea. But then, like Michael Corleone or Silvio Dante said - When I thought I was out, they pulled me back in!!!!\n\nLong story short, I felt like we exhausted our conversations a bit by the fourth date and in a moment of panic I became a little forceful with the talking and started talking about how I was still being haunted by a past rejection of someone I felt strongly about - now that I think about it, I seriously am mad at myself for that. \n\nOh my God, just OH MY GOD what the fuck was wrong with me!?? Why talk about someone else when a girl I actually had something nice going on with is right fucking there!??? I was a moron in that moment. Us not having anything super exciting to talk about would not have been that bad, she still had a great impression of me and some moments of silence would not have ruined my chances with her; I wish I knew this then and there rather than later on when I began pondering.\n\nAs you might've guessed, we didn't kiss after I dropped her home after the fourth date. Just a hug (a rather reluctant hug from her) and a good night.... she's still replying to my texts but the response time is now longer and she now makes less effort in talking to me. Can't blame her.\n\nLike the old saying goes - it can take a long time to build your reputation, but it takes only moments to destroy it.",

Just accept that this may never happen, grieve a bit, and move on with your life. Don't look at others, don't reminisce, just make the best of what you have.

I can believe the story. Less charitably I could say that it's shocking how many healthcare professionals are in the sector out of pressure from their family, even if they lack any ambition of their own to enter such a field. To not be in that of one's own choosing must be alienating. Such a route through life can leave one being at a loss for how to deftly interact in an environment that was never of their choosing. Least charitable is that the field seems just ripe enough for a sob story of achievement and graft without just rewards. Boo hoo. I sincerely hope it isn't the latter case.\n\nIn my life I can't say I've seen a more densely clustered space of young, pretty, successful people as in a university hospital. It's similar again in the ambulance service. Many are the times I've been out about my business behind the wheel of my semi, and the paramedic pulling out ahead of me has been a young woman easy on the eye. I have to expect that they're all struggling to find companionship and meaning to.

If they cared they would match those efforts. So ultimately I still havent tried. I was in the negatives my whole life and now I'm barely clinging to an unstable 0. I'll just stay here.",

I slept last night without much else to do or be except an empty bed and a broken heart, and when I began dreaming (I remember up to 4\\~5 dreams per night), I had this wonderful instance where I actually had a loving girlfriend.\n\nShe was like I imagine a great girlfriend would be. She was cheerful, empathetic, and seemed to truly care about me. In the dream, she dragged me into this mall, always giggling and never leaving my hand. We intertwined fingers. I think we were escaping from her father who was there to pick her up, but she just wanted to stay with me, \"Just a bit more\". Physically, I don't remember her face that much, except for notable things like blonde hair? It was dyed on the tips with a pinkish colour, I believe. Honestly, I don't remember, and I wish I could remember her face and voice, at least.\n\nThen I woke up. Immediately, instead of doing anything else, my subconscious urged me to resume sleeping. To see her again. So, as I was sleeping on my right side, I turned to sleep on my left side, and that was what I needed to continue the same or similar dream. It is a strategy I've used before to prolong a narrative within a dream. And there she was again. In a bedroom with the draped curtains and dotted sunlight sneaking through. The smile, the genuine smile someone gives you when they *love* you and think you're their priority made me melt, and for a brief instance, I felt happy. I felt cared for.\n\nShe caressed my cheek and said something, but even though I don't remember what she said word-for-word, I understand now that it meant \"We cannot be together\". I woke up. I tried to repeat the same strategy to no avail. My subconscious must've urged me to continue sleeping many times after; I couldn't dream about her again that morning.\n\n  \nWhat a depressing moment of blissful joy.",

In other words, they fit the beauty standard that trending at the moment (glass skin, no skin conditions, big lips and some sort of alternative style, wigs that sit completely flat).

The only thing you need to worry about is standing up on your own two feet and being an independent adult. Your parents raised you and did their duty in caring for you until you were an adult.

I just have no motivation or drive to do anything anymore. \n\nI honestly do have a lot of good qualities.

Not to physically harm anyone, but to destroy souls as mine has been destroyed beyond measure, without mercy. It's as if my passion must be directed toward one extreme or the other... love or hate. Anything in between feels mechanical and lifeless. When I remain in between, I yearn for death at every moment.",

It's a hollow and peaceful feeling on the inside, a very bizarre feeling mixture, knowing I won't ever actually feel genuinely fulfilled and warmth at being recognized as a person by the world and having others to go through life with beside. I know it won't mean much of anything to hear from another stranger online, but I do wish, not 'hope', that somehow, someway, a miracle just happens for us as soon as possible. That something will just radically change our situations.",

I thought it was normal, that the conversations didn't have to be so intense. We went from constant flirting to more mundane conversation. Again, I thought it was normal, because you're getting to know all the facets of a person and you don't need to know just one thing. \n\nIn three and a half weeks, I went from being someone different, someone she genuinely liked to be with, someone she felt unusually comfortable with, someone she couldn't just reverse the relationship with, to just being friends. Three and a half weeks after a twelve-hour date in which, once again, we kissed at the end. Apparently, she stopped feeling that the relationship made sense while we were kissing - or at least that contributed to the conclusion. \n\nI don't blame her at all - although it would have been nice if she hadn't taken three and a half weeks to tell me that she only saw me as a friend. I only blame myself for believing that, as a 35-year-old virgin, I could escape a life of being forever alone.\n\nSorry to vent, but my world has collapsed",

Remove all traces of her, find purpose, let yourself heal and move on. That’s all I can say at the end brother keep moving on.",

That is not some great injustice done to you. That is how dating works. The fact that you frame this as “going from someone she genuinely liked to just being friends” as if friendship is some kind of cruel downgrade speaks volumes about how you view relationships. You were not tricked. You were not led on. She gave it a chance, and it did not work for her.\n\nYour reaction to this is completely disproportionate. “My world has collapsed” is absurd. Your world did not collapse. A woman you went on three dates with decided she was not interested. That is all that happened. The reason it feels like your world collapsed is because you are placing an unhealthy amount of emotional weight on this situation. That is codependency. You are not just disappointed by the loss of this relationship, you are treating it like the loss of your entire chance at happiness. That kind of thinking is exactly why you are struggling. You are not looking for a relationship. You are looking for someone to validate your existence. That is suffocating. That is not love. That is neediness, and it drives people away.\n\nInstead of wallowing in self-pity and declaring that you are doomed to be “forever alone” after one minor dating setback, you need to take a serious look at why you are reacting this way. Your entire post screams desperation. You placed this woman on a pedestal and convinced yourself that this was your one shot at escaping loneliness. It is possible you did something that gave her the ick, and rather than assuming you are simply unlucky, you should focus on self-improvement.\n\nThe fact that you are a 35-year-old virgin is irrelevant, except for the way you clearly make it your defining characteristic. Nobody wants to date someone who is consumed by their own perceived inadequacy. If you keep framing yourself as some tragic, undateable figure, you will make that a self-fulfilling prophecy. Relationships are not about finding someone to rescue you from your loneliness. They are about being a whole person who can connect with another whole person. Until you understand that, you will continue to sabotage yourself.",

Thoughts of \"I'm the ugliest being the world has ever seen\" are also pretty common, however since a few here have showed their faces, its hard to say, how many of the members of this sub are simply overly-insecure about their appearance. Its also hard to ascertain someone's social issues by looking at their engagements here, as people tend to be more expressive online. There's also a number of us, who has to deal with some sort of trauma when it comes to dating (a crush getting together with someone who is similar to you, but isn't you; a very awkward or hard to swallow rejection, etc.)\n\nThis leads to people just accepting their fate, or give up after some surface level trying, or at the first sign of failure. In a lot of other cases people shun advice, labelling it as \"toxic positivity\" and \"generic and meaningless\" and while yes, hearing the same advices can be tiring or even disheartening at times, I don't think \"someone pointing at a potential partner and writing up a script for you to follow\" would help (or be even morally correct), granted a lot of us here would go a long way with some appropriate encouragement.\n\nI feel like with the right encouragement, advice, and social skill development, most of us here would likely find love. But a lot here tends to just accept, that \"it can't be changed, I'll be a loser forever\" and are burning up in the flames of their depression and self-hate.\n\nSorry, if I ended up offending, hurting, or making any here uncomfortable.

I can grow as a person, but it is probably going to be very limited considering that I don’t have the typical experiences of most adults given my isolation. Even if I do grow or continue to improve and work on myself, it hardly means anything if I don’t have anyone in my life to actually see that and to apply it in their life. If I don’t put myself out there if I don’t try, maybe in rare cases, I get friends, but I don’t really get dates. When I have definitely tried I don’t really make friends as no one reciprocates.

When I finally had these things, and still struggled with dating I thought maybe it was social anxiety. I took care of that to a large degree and now I really don't know what the fuck and I'm getting closer to 40 by the day. There is no reason I should be so undatable and yet here I am. I thought I had comfort in knowing I was still young. The true source of comfort was knowing there was something to work toward, that I had some sort of control over the situation. \n\nNow I have no control over it and it's all the same. The last of the tiny improvements I made is being able to keep in touch for a month until it falls to the wayside. It's only gotten this good for 2 years in a row. I don't think I'll ever get past that hurdle because most of them start online even though I'm willing to move.",

No longer did I think about \"what if?\" No longer did I languish in self-hatred, convinced something was irredeemably wrong with me. No, I proved it isn't my fault. The problem is society, this dating market, not me. Not to say I'm perfect of course, nobody is, but by sheer process of elimination the problem can't be me because I've fixed or improved on everything possible.\n\nNow I can at least hold my head high, tell myself with conviction that failure was not a moral failing on my part but a simple inevitability, make peace with being alone and start putting that effort toward enriching my life in other ways. Because as important as a good relationship is to one's well-being in life, it is not the only thing.\n\nTo your comment about not wanting to move, though, I will say I've been making the effort to drive to the big city 90 minutes away from me 1-2 times/week since the start of 2024 and I feel like it's helped my social life more than anything else I've ever tried.",

Of course I like and love my mother and female relatives, this is by no means a woman-hating rant and I acknowledge that some of the things I’m about to say are personal shortcomings. \n\nIt’s been a while, but I’ve definitely had crushes before but there were always superficial and often developed before I spoke a single word to the girl.  I don’t think I’ve ever had interest in a woman because I liked or cared about them as a person, it’s was always because they were pretty, maybe they said hi to me once or laughed at a stupid joke I made. The last time I had a crush like this I was 14-15, she and her friends suspected it and I was brutally ridiculed. I’m 22 and though I’ve gotten significantly less superficial, I don’t think I’ve had a legitimate crush since then, I am physically attracted to women and am obsessed with the idea of a relationship and romantic love but can’t find myself liking or caring about any individual woman. Anytime I find myself developing interest, I subconsciously end up picking at their flaws or potential flaws or just convincing myself they must be in a relationship, I do this until I am completely uninterested and I has worked pretty much every time. I’m also quick to forget about girls, I might notice a cute girl in class but as soon as it ends she’s out of my head, like I lack object permanence. I wouldn’t be surprised if this was some kind of defense mechanism to prevent me from expressing interest, I told you how that ended last time. \n\nI find myself thinking about being in a relationship often, but struggle imagining the type of girl I’d share it with, again my experiences really make me question if I’ve ever even liked a girl. As shitty and egotistical as it sounds, I catch myself questioning if there is even a woman out there worth my time and emotion. I don’t know what the hell I even want anymore, and I don’t know if this rant is cohesive but I just needed to dump my thoughts and feelings. Again, please don’t mistake me as a misogynist, I genuinely do not hate women and have tried to acknowledge my flaws but I hope my explanation gives some insight on why I think the way I do. ",

I think of it as being sexually attracted to women but not mentally attracted to them. I don’t think I have ever had a strong crush on a girl (even back in school) though I find myself wanting a relationship often which makes no sense. I think part of it stems from watching many of my male role models have very poor relationships with women and it made me subconsciously never want to get close to one (plus the fact that I’ve never had a positive experience or been shown any interest from a women). Then in college I had a few female friends before I dropped out and I feel like I honestly can’t look at women in the same way as I did before that. I think the only reason I feel lonely and bad about being single is my biology, that little voice constantly telling you that you need someone but the other part of your mind telling you that you don’t. It’s a real mind fuck at times.",

I started getting friends yes, but I'm not the one people chose or their first option when they think of their friend.\n\nthough I have found some people to be my ride or die, it pains me to see them moving on with life, the way I dreamed mine would. \n\nunfortunately, I would probably end up the eternally single guy in the group, sometimes it hurts when I think about all the possibility of how my life could have been had I stayed the state I was back in junior high school, the handsome me, the one people were flocking too, and now I just feel, hollow. \n\nLike I know I could be more, and I saw a chance looking back then that I could have been more but, sometimes fate just acts that way, and I am trying my best to live okay with it all, because try as I might to change it, I never get pass the judgement and disgust of others.\n\nI know you shouldn't mind what other people say about you, and that's particularly true but the problem  is, being content the forever alone way, is literally being a hermit, you cannot be hurt if you're never interacting with others, and not all people are bad but the thing is, its hard when people target lock you for no apparent reason, maybe I'm oozing with insecurity (i dont know anymore).\n\nIts just tough, my problem here is that I am fine with being alone its just that, the alternative idea of what could I have been sometimes pops up every now and then and it just breaks me, how things could have been so different.\n\nI' thankful for the people I met, who cherish me, and are now moving on to bigger and better things in life but still look back to tell me how much I mean to them but.\n\nwhat about me, when do I move on, I know I'm moving to, getting a degree, a job, a salary but, why do I still feel like no matter what I do I still feel hollow, like a part of me is craving something, I want more than this, but I also know reality doesn't work that way, its painful.\n\n\\~as a side note, I developed maladaptive day dreaming disorder to cope with me not being able to fully accept this as my reality, as per my therapist, and she's right, I literally spend hours day dreaming, a sort of escapism as you may\\~\n\nI know this seems pathetic and sad, but its my life, and sometimes, I just wanna vent.

                "text_body": "I was coming back from grocery shopping earlier this evening. Three guys were passing by and one of them greeted me. I don't even remember the exact words but the exchange went something like this: \n\n\"Hey how's it going?\" \n\n\"It's alright. How about you guys?\" \n\n\"It's going good.\" \n\n\"Cool.\"\n\nRemarkable, I know. Yet here I am over two hours later thinking about this brief occurrence.\n\nI think I've heard these guys in the hall before. They must be either brothers or friends. They seem late highschool or college-aged. Decent-looking, unintimidating guys with a slight bro-ish vibe. They seemed to have plans tonight of some sort.\n\nKeep in mind, I'm coming in from the cold, awkwardly carrying two full bags. I'm one of those guys who still wears a mask sometimes, and my beanie is probably covering more of my forehead than it needs to. I don't look very approachable, but for whatever reason someone said hi.\n\nHe probably thinks that I'm one of his peers. Little does he know that I'm 31, have never dated, have no in-person friends. I have no job, I have no education, I don't know how to drive, or do much of anything for that matter. I waste hours on Reddit, I play cheesy music on my keyboards, and I'm addicted to weird porn. I couldn't get myself out of bed until like 5pm today. Little do they know that I was the basement dweller who single-handedly ruined the internet in 2014. Little do they know I am a pitiful piece of shit. But without talking to me for longer than five seconds, I guess I still appear like a normal enough person.\n\nOf course, who's to say that I know who these people really are? Maybe they're somehow just as old as me, awkward with everyone but each other, and they're actually all going to Robbie's place later to smoke weed and play old videogames to distract from their woes. Probably not though.\n\nI was in such an awful place mentally when I was their age, so much worse than now. Thinking back to 17, I wasn't in any state of mind to be making friends. Even though some of the people in my special-ed room were friendly with me, I was mostly avoidant and indifferent. I wonder, if I had been just a tiny bit less autistic, a tiny bit less depressed, a tiny bit less unlucky, I wouldn't have gotten so consumed by those internet rabbit holes. I wouldn't have convinced myself that my alienation was proof of my superiority. I wouldn't have clung so tightly to my escapist delusions. I wouldn't have needed to. If I hadn't been suicidal, if I had felt like it was worth investing in the future, maybe I would have gone to college. Maybe I would have actually had a healthy social life, capable of befriending both 'normies' and nerds. Maybe by now I would've been years into a lucrative and somewhat meaningful cybersecurity career. Maybe I would have bought a house in a nice quiet area, and found the love of my life. If I had gotten the right kind of help with my childhood difficulties, and not been ripped away from the vast majority of my peers, could I have learned to integrate in time? So that a fellow human saying hello to me in passing wouldn't send me spiraling internally? Because I would know intuitively that I was human too, and that I didn't have to plan and pretend, I could just be?\n\nWishful thinking, and not of any use now. God, fuck autism so much, and all the other shit. I was so close.\n\nObviously I'm reading too much into tonight's great social event, but I guess the main thing here is that I appreciate the interaction, albeit in a way that inevitably draws attention to how dreary and barren my life is that this should even be notable in the first place. So at the same time I kind of wish that guy hadn't said hi to me, 'cause look at what that unleashed.",

That this is a virtual requirement of modern life feels not just philosophically but instinctively wrong to me. Obviously most people are able to get through it, but it disturbs me to the point that I shut down if I think about it for too long -- what it would actually take to learn, and imagining what that looks like. Evidently I'm not afraid of being in a vehicle; I have an easy time trusting people to drive well enough. It's just such a huge mental block. And I don't trust myself to drive either, whether that be from getting overwhelmed by the experience, being just too damn tired, or from the fear that I may accidentally kill someone or intentionally kill myself.",

As an FAer, once you have the realization of how your life has been, everything quickly falls in place. You understand exactly how everything became the way it is. You see clearly how fruitless your efforts were/will be. And you actively begin to appreciate life in all of its inadequacies and minor pockets of contentment. Indeed, FAers, when they pass into this stage, grow a step or two in maturity, and become content with their life, for the acceptance that \"this is it\" and the understanding that, other than the lack of \"success\" with the desired sex, they have attempted and achieved, to some degree, a dull but a perfectly serviceable life (terribly sorry to exclude FAers who live in poverty, this is just my opinion), brings them enough justification for life itself. Try however much, one can only cry and struggle and shriek for so long; acceptance is the only road, and even the ones that consider the rest stupid for quietly bowing to our fate will slowly come to realise the same winding, solitary path of our rather peculiar existence.\n\n\nOmegas will never find what others manage to, these men live out their lives quietly, solemnly, witness to the (in comparison) spry lives of those around them. The idea is to stop being at odds with the ultimate authority, and simply understand and accept the circumstances; such men underwent varying levels of agony and distress over their lack of romantic and sexual success. The point is to be as comfortable as possible, and assuming some level of material possessions that can bring forth a decent level of amenity for the flesh and enough mental acumen to prevent falling into loops of psychological dread and despair. And finally, to bow out peacefully, hopefully in our own terms, leaving everything behind without a care.",

Eventually I can see some narcissistic parent respond to that with something like ‘you’re hurting me by not giving me grand children’ in which case cutting down contact is a fair response.

I grew up in rural Mississippi, a lifelong atheist stuck in the deepest south of the deep south. It was so bad there going to public school, a straight up violation of separation of church and state, that my parents called the ACLU, only for them to say that I'd have to go to school with a tape recorder to get evidence for a case, at the age of 10. We moved sometime after that; it was the final nail, after me having so many respiratory illnesses, Hurricane Katrina and fucked by insurance, and then 2008 crash.\n\nWhen I arrived in Ohio \\~2010, I wondered what these glowing boxes were that people had. I'd never seen a touch screen before. I didn't know they were real. I didn't fit in much better up north, and this whole social media thing, the more I learned about it, all seemed so fake, plastic, and shallow. I also learned overtime, that it wasn't normal to have no family outside my parents and brother, and it wasn't normal for my parents to have no friends. I'd never thought about it much before.\n\nFrom middle school on, I've had this sense in the back of my head that I'd end up alone, no seeming concrete reason, I thought it was just my own outlook or something. I managed to make some friends at the end of middle school and in high school that I still and close with today, no dating success ever though. I thought I might end up normal in 9th grade when I hit it off with someone. The conversations flowed naturally, and we'd always eat lunch together, and it was the great winter of 2014, everything seemed to be going great. She gradually stopped talking to me after some months. Senior year of high school, I learned from a friend of mine that in that time, she was figuring out she was a lesbian, I thought I had said something wrong those years before, and still wonder why she spent lunch at the table alone with me back then and light up in our conversations.\n\nI graduated high school with no romantic experience, and then it was off to college. I had no car, and my family only had one car, so I had to be driven to and from campus. I got my first cell phone at 18. Some more time passed. I tried to strike up conversation with some women I found attractive. It never went anywhere. A few sentences between us and either she'd have no interest, I'd realize we had nothing in common, or she was taken. I turned 20, the age my mom was when she married my dad. Most I got was to go in a dorm and watch an episode of anime with someone. It never led anywhere, but I got a new piracy website to use. I started browsing this sub-reddit as a younger FA, seeing posts from people with most or all of their 20s behind them, still thinking that 'I can't *really* end up stuck here forever, right?' A few years later I turned 22, the age my dad was when he married my mom.\n\nI graduated at 23, chemistry degree, with no romantic experience still. I tried clubs, bars, and even a bit at anime convos. Nothing. Drinking got worse, and that's a story of its own I've just recently finished. I'm now one of those 'middle FAs' as I'll call it. I'm not late teens or just starting my 20s anymore, but I'm not 40 yet either. I've made peace with it after these years, not that it doesn't still hurt, but I manage. I guess I was right in the end all those years ago. \n\nNearly 26 now, at least I have a car and money saved up now. I do at least want to get out of this boring corn state someday and move somewhere cold, if my navigation skills weren't so bad that I can't read paper maps, and had to have my dad print out paper directions for when I was at college, for how to get between classes, and sheets of lefts and rights, because I can't read maps. One time while taking my dirt bike to the trails, I lost cell signal, and then broke my phone while trying to wave it in the air to get signal. I thought I could find my way to the trails, I'd been there 10 times or more. I ended up at a Dollar General in Michigan asking to borrow a phone so I could call for help. I didn't know I'd crossed into Michigan until then.",

Seeing this stuff just gives me physical pain in my chest. I actually hurt from looking at her posts. It feels like my heart is being squeezed.\n\nJust the fact that I will never experience what her bf has and can never relive the past. I also have had thoughts about maybe if I would have talked to her in HS I could have made something work and I would be happier. Cause I did like her at one point. But the fact that the past 5-6 years have been so brutally lonely for me, while this guy has had the luck of being with her, I can't help but cry inside.\n\nDoes her bf even realize how lucky is? Is he grateful? I don't think people realize the blessing it is to have a partner in your life that you are genuinely attracted to and loves you. I can only dream of such a thing. Especially being with someone for that long.\n\nImagine, I am a 23 year old guy wishing I was with a girl I knew from HS. How depressing life can be sometimes.\n\nI am more educated than her BF. I probably come from a better family. I probably am more talented than him in some areas. And I still wish I was in his shoes.\n\nSome people get so lucky in this life and don't even realize how lucky they are, while the rest of us suffer.",

However, please take a moment to breathe and ask yourself: What have these experiences objectively proven, versus what they seem to indicate?\n\nThis is an odd analogy, but for what it's worth: You know how when there's elections, it takes a while to count the votes? And on news sites, they'll update the totals every few minutes. And maybe for Region X, it'll show Candidate A is beating Candidate B by a lot, *but* they've only counted 10% of the votes so far? So it's too early to tell. You've gotta wait for the rest of the votes to be counted, and in all of the regions too. I'm basically saying that out of all of the girls you have, might, and will meet, these girls you're trying to talk with on Snapchat present a small number. It's quite possible that things will be difficult though, I won't deny that.\n\nNo one really knows for sure what the future holds, but what I do know is that unless you have something like severe deformities on your face, you are too young to be getting hopeless. I mean this in the most gentle caring way: The time and energy you spend dwelling on this, if you continue to focus on it, will be worse than the rejection itself.\n\nNot everyone has a highschool romance. It's probably ideal, but it's not the worst thing in the world. Many people don't find their first partner until afterwards. Granted I'm not speaking from actual experience (I am here, after all), but from what I understand -- up to a point, being inexperienced in relationships matters less than your attitude towards it. The right people will understand (they may be inexperienced themselves). You get a lot more leeway with this during ages 18-25, after which it will become a bit harder. \n\nIf you're too discouraged right now, I would honestly suggest putting this all aside and focusing on yourself for the next year or so -- your academics, hobbies, friendships, etc. \n\nYou're already here -- I don't know how many threads on this subreddit you've read. But you've more or less stumbled upon a bunch of adults moping at a bar, sharing their woes. We may or may not have things in common, but ultimately, you're your own person, with your own life that's different from others'. Don't let other people's hopelessness become your own.

Personally the only addiction I have is to NSFW content... but tbh that hasn't been satisfying for a long while now. It doesn't account for actual love. The content that tries can never fully accomplish that either. You can always remind yourself that you can just pause it at anytime, which teleports you back to your dark room with nobody there that actually cares about you. \n\nIt definitely feels like I'm past the point of no return, but there is still a part of me that hopes for something better. The logical part of me fights it, knowing that nothing will happen. Recently, my hope has been winning, but that just leaves me with that heavy sinking feeling in your heart and chest. Sometimes it feels like the early stages of a panic attack that never truly comes. I hate how much it can hurt... especially since I know it's all for false hope anyway.\n\nThe thing I hate most though, is that I feel like I've tried my hardest my whole life and after all of it, I was rewarded with sadness and isolation. It sucks knowing that everybody that might have a good memory of me remembers me for the things I can do, and not the person I am. For a long time I never truly realized that, which led me to living my life looking for that high of being appreciated for my abilities. The outcome was disallowing myself to be an actual person, instead becoming a machine made to get things done. I don't want to be that anymore, but I don't think that's possible now.\n\nThe absolute worst part through it all though? I can't force myself to try anymore, and no one is there to help in digging me out. If anything, I hope that if we can't have any happiness, that we at least don't receive any more pain. \n\nAnyway, sorry for the long tangent-y reply. 😖",

Can't say I fully disagree. \n\nWhat else can one say though, if naturally they're not going to take on the task of assessing your psyche and difficulties and then providing you with informed personalized advice? It's a quick low-effort way to signal support, yet in this platitude there still is timeless wisdom:\n\n* It can get better. The environment or circumstances you find yourself in presently might not be well-suited to your growth, but they are not necessarily permanent. Perhaps things won't be as hard in your next phase of life.\n\n* It's not the end. Sometimes, for whatever reason, it just takes longer than average to get your relationships/career/life in order. For many of us, there will be setbacks and failures. But keep on.\n\nThe point of the saying is essentially to remove shame, and to gently encourage people to have a little bit of faith in themselves and the future in order to re-focus their thoughts towards their efforts, rather than dwelling about it further.\n\nI think the main issue is that the Late Bloomer concept is applied so broadly, and as a sort of first (or only) response. By definition its usefulness decreases with time; I would be extremely hesitant to utter those words to anyone 25 and older. Likewise, it's bound to be less useful to someone who may in fact have a permanent affliction, or circumstances that make improving their life truly a painfully uphill struggle. From what I understand, the Late Bloomer is usually someone at least adjacent to 'normal' who will figure it out in time, and in hindsight, never needed to worry so much. But society, and the bloomers themselves, don't actually know that yet. OP or I or you reading this technically might find a loving partner next year. It's just like with ForeverAlone, but a direct inversion: you can identify with it, but you won't truly know if you *were* it, until you either find someone or never do ('never' arguably being the end of your life, or a point in middle-age where you definitively give up). \n\nIn this interpretation I just made up, as long as we're trying, or hoping, we actually exist simultaneously in both the spheres of Potential FA and Potential LB. But in reality, late blooming has a limited shelf life. At what age does the Late Bloomer concept (and its cousin, \"You're still so young!\") become utterly ridiculous? If we had to put a number on it, I would argue 40, and I think people would generally agree that it starts getting pretty shaky after 30. \n\nI think that as a society we don't really know what to say to people after age 30, let alone 40. Most other people don't really want to deal with it or even know about it. The world more or less gives up on you and moves on. A lot of us more or less give up on ourselves and move on. What happens if it turns out that you sadly weren't a Late Bloomer, and you're an aging FA? The message seems to be... nothing at all.",

Much more room to sprawl out.  And there was never any risk of knocking into anyone.  And therein lies the problem.  There was so much more space, but so much more emptiness.  It's like the emptiness of the mattress matched the emptiness of my life.\n\nIn the middle of the night, there's never anyone to reach over and touch.  The only thing to feel is my phone charger.  Never a hand to hold or a back to rest my hand around.  Nobody to ever reach over to just touch me.  It's made for two, but only occupied for one.  It's set for two.  I have another set of pillows there, looking like they are waiting for someone.  But that someone doesn't exist.  Day after day they stay pristinely placed, perfectly fluffed.\n\nIn those long nights, birthday nights, holiday nights, weekend nights, I don't think there's anything as agonizing as being stricken with insomnia, ruminating on your loneliness, in a place that makes it perfectly clear every single night just how alone you are.  Nobody's coming to lie down with you after you had a hard day.  There's never anyone there to cuddle with and hide under the blankets with.  There's just you.\n\nYour hand can flail around all it wants, but it will never meet another.  There's only ever your imperceptible scent, never the trace that the person you care for and adore was there. You can have the softest, most comfortable mattress in the world, but it can do nothing to counter the cold stone reality of your situation.  \n\nJust for once I wish I had someone to lie down with.",

He was probably the only person that really got me, and who I looked forwards to hanging out with. We were both doomers and pretty much isolated from the rest of our peers. He had a few friends from his classes but they weren't super close or anything. So far I seemed to also be the only person that he could feel chill with and who understood him as well. However, this changed during my first year of university, when he found himself a gf. This combined with my busy schedule caused us to quickly drift apart. I really tried to keep the friendship alive, but he would ghost my text messages and calls, and just say he was busy even though I knew that wasnt true. He just stopped caring about me, like 8 years of friendship meant nothing to him. This was also during one of the worse bouts of depression in my life. I told him when I was particularly mentally unwell about a year ago that i had constant thoughts about taking my own life and that I just wanted someone to talk to but he didnt even give a shit, he ghosted me for like 2 weeks and after that responded with he doesnt think I will.\n\n  \nHonestly i dont know anymore. To me my life never really seemed to get any better. I dont really understand why this happened but between this and the death of my dog last summer, I dont really have the motivation to continue or try to succeed anymore. My grades have been getting worse and worse, and while before I dreamt of someday getting a PhD ive kind of lost hope of all of that. I just want to be normal.\n\n  \nIdk, im feeling extremely lost, and have been for the past 2 years. If anybody has any advice it would be great",

Maybe you're posting at a less optimal time of day. Perhaps the subreddit or group has a strong bias towards its regulars. Some subs go as far as to require certain topical criteria or some threshold of activity. It's possible that you could be wording your posts in a way that feels more negative or less engaging than the average person's, but I wouldn't assume that either. Very unlikely but apparently there are cases where some weirdo will go out of their way to downvote every post from someone they're mad at. But I also wouldn't assume that.\n\nThe content and discussions we see are largely decided by the kinds of users who enjoy judging or responding to new posts. So one or two random people just not liking your post and downvoting it could very well sink it. Activity creates more activity, so by replying to you sooner than later, hopefully I'm making your post a little bit more attractive to everyone else.\n\nSubreddits for depression (here included, I guess), I think, are a whole different dynamic. In a cynical way, you could see it as a contest of who has the most relatable/severe sob story. We're real people with real issues, but we're all just creating content at the end of the day. There's limited time and limited space on the front page. There's a million crying voices and sadly not all of them will be heard. It's possible that yours is just not all that interesting, but that says nothing about your degree of likeability either.\n\nI struggle too with fitting in. But ultimately, I don't really want to. I want to be able to express myself authentically wherever I go, and if feelings of kinship and belonging develop, that's great. But it's not worth it to be driven too much by that desire, lest you take on the stresses of real or perceived social pressure, and worst case lose yourself in the process. Sadly, and this may not necessarily be good advice, but besides building a higher tolerance of my loneliness, I'm finding that I'm probably better off just expecting much less of people, groups, the world altogether. Pretty much everyone and everything alienates me. But it's profoundly unhealthy to embrace isolation, so I'm trying to learn how to *take part* in the world while not trying so hard to feel *part of it*.\n\nNot sure what your real-life situation is like, but I hope things improve, and if not, you find some way to adapt that's more growth than cope.",

Yeah.\n\nI went through the gauntlet of all the self-improvement crap we're supposed to do. As I continued to check off more and more proverbial boxes without seeing a corresponding increase in dating success, eventually I had no choice but to come to the conclusion... maybe the problem isn't me. I'm running out of ways to blame myself for my failures. People don't like to acknowledge it, because it bursts their Just-world Fallacy bubble, but success is largely down to luck in the end. Relationships involve two people but you only control one. Attraction can't be forced and people can't be compelled to give you a chance. I don't need other people's validation, because I've validated myself through cold hard facts.\n\nI think it's less that confidence is attractive and more that insecurity is unattractive. Like, I'm very confident in myself after years of \"working on myself\" but that doesn't make someone automatically like how I look or behave. Only a small proportion of people will ultimately be compatible with you regardless of how self-assured you are, however you can push those people away by being insecure. If they keep showing they like you and you keep saying crap like \"I don't know why,\" \"I suck,\" \"no you don't,\" it's like saying you don't trust them. Relationships are built on trust, and being overly negative all the time is emotionally draining. So, be confident for yourself, and be confident so you don't push people away by being overly insecure. Confidence by itself doesn't hold anyone's attention for long, though.",

Society wants survival of the fittest .. it doesn't care one bit about an individuals love life.",

Somebody with truly bad intentions/evil who is attractive definitely does not have to go through what we have to go through and a lot of times people let them get away with it.\n\nBut if me or most you guys were to speak about your frustrations, or do one small wrong thing or even just make a a move that you’re unaware of to a woman then we are subjected to being labeled as creep, perpetrators, or even arrested.

Because I know that she will put in zero effort the moment our conversation starts and will probably ghost me a few days later anyways. \n\nThere were times where I did my hair every morning and shaved my beard twice a week. Now I do that stuff like once a month because I receive zero attention on my looks anyways. It all just feels like a waste of time that will never get me anything in return.\n\nI also took part in dancing classes and picked up sports. But guess what happened there? I have always just been an aquaintance. Nobody was ever interested to do something together outside of the event. So at this point I ask myself why I should even try getting to know new people. Nobody wants to add me to their life, no matter how much I try to build up a connection.\n\nSo the ultimate question remains: Why bother? I don't have an answer to this question anymore. It just feels more healthy to simply stop developing feelings and opening up to others. I already know the end result in advance so there is no reason to play it out.",

I have tried doing many things differently over these years and I get constantly bombarded by many people telling me that I need to better myself work on myself if I want to have a better shot luck. Meanwhile I see other guys who are in very worse situations, and I am in life at least having a romantic partner already and a lot of them are even younger than me by a number of years while I constantly get told that I’m not meeting the right kind of people. I think that’s disrespectful because if I did not try and if I did not work on myself like I’ve been told to a lot of folks would think I’m lazy and preached to me that I’ll never find somebody. But that’s not what I did and still I get told that I need to keep trying and I need to keep getting myself out there, even as statistics have proven for me that the odds are against me.",

We met online and it was the first girl I managed to meet from online dating, despite investing an incredible amount of effort over the years. She was my first kiss. She was a heavy girl but I was very much attracted to her. The reason we broke up is she was \"poly\" which wasn't compatible with my values.\n\nI haven't been dating online since we broke up. This whole process is just too frustrating. You make this online profile to try to market yourself and try to convince women that you are worth something, but the vast majority are not impressed by you. I hate opening my dating profile because of this, because it is a reminder that I am unwanted. This all happens as you age and get less attractive and even more unwanted, which makes things exponentially harder. I work hard to make well into the 6 figures and will soon be a millionaire, but I am still \"not bringing anything to the table\". And when after years of trying I met someone who liked me, she didn't want to commit to me. And when I try to ignore online and meet women in person, whatever event I go to is always filled with only elderly people, so there really is no option outside of online.\n\nThis is just too frustrating/impossible. Dating is the hardest thing I have ever done in my life. I never wanted to be single forever. I used to dream of one day meeting someone and starting a family. I'm just physically incapable of going on. It's like being being trapped deep in the wilderness with my arm caught under a boulder. I might know it's in my interests to say off my arm with a pocket knife, so that I could get up and find food, but I would just be physically incapable of bringing myself to do it.",

First year I lived on campus in dorms because I had the stupid belief that it would be like they show in the movies and tv shows and I will actually turn my life around and enjoy college life, since throughout my hs and elementary years ive been pretty much isolated, and my only friend recently got a gf and ditched me. Well by the end of the first year I would sit by myself in my room and cry out of frustration, while people socialized and shit outside. Yeah my mental state tumbled pretty quick.\n\n  \nalso the dating apps thing i can also relate to. So far I have gotten 2 matches in the last year and a half by people who were honestly below average (not that there is a problem with that I don t prioritize stunning looks, I believe connection is much more important because you dont want to get stuck to a beautiful bitch that will make your life hell). Both ended up ghosting me which somehow lowered my already rock bottom self esteem.",

This is on top of the fact that I don’t have as many options as I used to. I keep on hearing people say that there are things we should do to better ourselves or continue trying to be the best person you can be and somebody will see that, but to me it doesn’t really matter that much when you almost have no opportunities or less opportunities and when you were young.

Many people contributed to that idea, but I was/am the main one responsible - I can see that clearly now. I know it may sound harsh, but we are not necessarily doomed to be virgins... Yes, it might be (a lot!) harder for us than it should be, yes, there is no guarantee that we can lose our virginity or have a relationship, but at least we can try to change, to improve and give ourselves a chance to see how much we can change. And don't get me wrong: I'm not belittling these feelings: I know how strong they are, how vivid they seem - I've lived them for many, many years (I'm still living them, because I still can't fully believe that my adventure with dating will necessarily end well...)\n\nI've discussed this with many here: I'm trying online dating now. I've had a few matches and I've had my first kiss with one of them. Now comes the part about age. I'm 35 years old. That fact alone puts a certain amount of pressure on me that would not be there if I were 21. At 21, you might be a bit late, considering the norm. At 35, you are an internet wizard. This will create fears, doubts and regrets of all kinds, once you start chatting with people that will be way more experienced than you are. You will be bitter about the past when you realise that you could have done things differently. You will wish you had started much earlier. That is why I say your age is a bit easier to try to change - if you want to, of course\n\nNow, I hope you do not find this answer to be complete nonsense.

I had been so, so quiet about these issues. I had never talked about it, not even online. It was a big taboo.\n\nSo I would advise you to find someone to help you. No psychologist, friend or anyone else will be able to do the hard part (actually flirting with a woman), but some might help you to start questioning your beliefs and not feel alone when you venture into new territory. Because, believe me, I live in fear now! I have no idea what I'm doing - and the psychologist help is proving to be key to keep my own sanity.

He too, is in his 30s like I am.  I met him through a Catholic group - he still practices a little, but is more questioning of it these days based on some past experiences he had.\n\nAnyway, he ended up dating another Catholic girl since the summer.  Things were going great, they both seemed to adore each other.  He ends up telling her that he used to be depressed for a bit and he felt that it cost him some time of his life.  One thing he regrets (that we discussed a few times) is that he never experimented with alcohol or drugs and that he wants to smoke weed and try getting drunk.\n\nShe tells him that's fine and that she would drink with him.  At first.  This ends up becoming a disagreement, not even a fight.  According to him, their first one ever because all of their differences in regards to their religious views were fine by the two of them, she didn't care that he wasn't some religious zealot, and he was fine with hers.  Even said he'd wait until marriage for her because he knew it was important.\n\nAnyway, after their \"fight\" she broke up with him because he said they were on two different paths.  There was no discussion about this, no clarity of what she meant.  Also of note, SHE was foreveralone before him.  33 and never in a relationship.  And she throws her first one away after not even something that's barely even a conflict I think.  \n\nHe's obviously devastated because there was no sign of any trouble ever before.  It just makes me feel hopeless because if he can so easily be broken up with, as great a guy he is, for something that seems so dumb, what hope is there for me and all my baggage?\n\nWas she being immature?  Maybe, I don't know.  Aren't couples expected to fight and be able to reconcile and compromise?  I have no idea so Idk what to even expect.  But I don't expect anything good.\n\n",

In the process I'm building up a helluva portfolio, getting published in the university newspaper and currently hosting my 3rd episode of my weekly university radio show. \n\nAdd to that I've been going to therapy on a regular basis and so far my mental health has been much better than it has been before. My physical health has improved as well. I got Gastric Bypass surgery almost a year ago and I've already lost over 130lbs since getting the procedure. It has helped me a lot in my physical health goals.\n\nSo overall, despite one pillar of my life probably never being rebuilt again, I've kind of accepted allowing the other pillars to rebuild and grow into future careers. At the very least I can distract myself with them and not have to worry about anything else...at least that's the hope anyway.",

My friends and family are all pretty surprised by it, as to be expected lol but it's been interesting, fun and honestly worth all the bs it took to get to this point. \n\nI want to say I lucked out (which was probably a big part of it) but tbh I decided to put myself out there (which sucked 99.9% of the time) and got on all the apps, joined local singles groups, and just started going out more. I dont want to say i was desperate but maybe a little. Everyone around me was living their lives and getting married having kids, going on family/couples  vacations and here i was. Watching netflix and playing videogames whenever i wasnt at work. So yeah i figured it was time for a last ditch effort to see if i could find someone. \n\nI spent the summer pretty much getting stood up and shit on by assholes (although a few were nice about their disinterest) and got to meet some cool people. When I was about to call it quits, I went on one last date before deleting everything because I figured why tf not, couldn't get any worse and the date was actually great! \n\nI will say I was pretty resigned to the fact that I was done dating/trying at this point and went into it with a \"who cares what's happens, or who this guy is. I just want to try and have fun tonight before i give up for good\", last hoorah type thing. Which i think worked in my favor because I wasn't so in my head about the date.\n\n And yeah he was great, sweet, nice, understanding (also had a poor dating history,  although not as limited as mine lol). He asked me out again and then I asked him out again and here we are a years and 5 months later. \n\nIs everything perfect? No. I still have a lot of learning to do about relationships and adjusting to not being on my own anymore but I'm just glad I don't have to do it all alone. \n\nIcing on the cake... I'm pregnant! Due sooner than expected lol Never thought I would be a mom. I'm terrified (mostly because of trying to have a baby at my age) about everything but ready to see what the future holds. \n\n\nTLDR:   Put myself out there one last time (it sucked. A lot.) and now at 37 I'm in my first happy, healthy, loving relationship with a little one on the way! Keep trying someone is out there for you!  ",

Now I’m taking baby steps to come out of it. Cos he’s happy living life with his wife making babies making love to his wife. I shouldn’t spare even a nanosecond of a thought to him anymore",

You may remember I posted my recent win here: https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/s/lYNj1tEcOp\n\nSo I met a woman by posting on the RAOMD subreddit a few days ago and after a good time yesterday we decided to meet again today.\n\nHonesty, I was expecting things to go slow but as soon as I got to her place things started to escalate quickly and once again I got lucky if you know what I mean.\n\nI won’t go into the details, however for now we seem to be getting along but are keeping things casual. We did get to talk more about ourselves again today so she is at least taking an interest. We are both busy during the week but agreed to meet up at a local spot on Valentine’s Day. \n\nUnfortunately we aren’t in the relationship stage yet although she did tell me she probably won’t be responding to anymore RAOMD posts and just stick with me. \n\nSo there it is. I don’t know if you could call this a win since we seem to be more in the FWB category rather than dating. My main goal was to get a relationship but I had no luck on dating apps and turned to the sub as a quick way to vent some frustration. \n\nWill this work out? We will see. She is really nice and I think she’s very attractive but hopefully I don’t end up heartbroken so I’ll keep my distance. \n\nWell, if anyone has any suggestions or questions please let me know. ",

I managed to meet up with someone from the sub RAOMD.\n\nI just discovered it last week and decided what the hell I’ll give it a shot. So I made a post a couple days ago and I got some responses.\n\nOf course some were bots and others were real women and so I spent some time talking to them. Eventually, I was able to meet a girl who was actually in my area. \n\nShe was definitely a good looking woman so I had my reservations about being catfished but eventually we set up a time for today and met up.\n\nLuckily she was who she said she was and we met up at a local coffee shop. She was a bit shy since like me, it was her first time meeting someone from the sub. \n\nEventually, we got comfortable enough to go back to her apartment and get down to business. It started out slow and the make out sesh got heated and I did what I was there to do.\n\nI thought it was going to be a quick one time thing and she would just kick me out but after the fact we started talking and seemed to have clicked more than expected.\n\nWe aren’t a couple or anything yet but she was very down to keep seeing each other again and so we have another meeting set up for tomorrow and then one Friday night for Valentines Day.\n\n I don’t want to count my chickens yet but things are looking up. I definitely recommend for you all to post on the sub RAOMD. It only took me one post and a few days of talk to have something set up. \n\nAnyway, thanks for listening to my post. I’ll update and answer any questions you may have tomorrow. ",

I had befriended her few days before or something and was going to sleep myself. I was about to fall asleep when i saw her looking lost and like she couldn't find a place to sleep. I told her that if she wants she can come sleep next to me and i made some room. \r\n\r\nShe got under the blanket and came to sleep right next to me. I had my other arm around her and the other under the pillows where our heads rested. Even in the dream my heart started racing a little, but i soon calmed down. I felt the happiest i've ever been. I even got a little hot after a minute, but that passed too.\r\n\r\nThe dream really gave some perspective on how numb and unhappy i've felt all my life.

Wasn’t a home run, but I actually talked to girls and held mediocre conversations where I said funny things and they laughed. Danced with a couple strangers. No huge revelations, but it seemed ok. Lots of girls were there with bfs, but plenty were there with their gfs and I just tried my best. I don’t think I got anywhere solid, but it was something.",

I express myself freely and I’m not worried about what the next person will think about me because they’re nothing to me outside of where I am in the moment (work, school, all that). I like this feeling more than waiting for a significant other to find me. It was hard being high maintenance and now I’m not afraid to try new things because I’m not worried about anyone. I wear makeup only when I wanna. I even found a new interest because all my friends would just have guys be the center of our conversation, the longer we would talk.. the more I would realize they don’t really have a hobby. So I went deeper into the interests and hobbies that I already had. I’m comfortable and happy now. I really like this feeling and I don’t know if I’m ready for a change at any point. \nFeel free to give me your incite on “love”. Thanks ❤️",

If you go through my profile, you'll see that it's full of ranting and venting about how I've always been rejected for 29 years ever since I was born, I keep trying and asking girls out, some accept, some don't but never it is the case that they really have genuine interest in me because they are never as enthusiastic as I am and all.\n\nI've always thought that it was about my looks or the way I behave and I couldn't figure out how to escape that.\n\nSo I matched with this girl on one of the popular dating apps (I won't name it so people don't think I'm promoting the app or something) and she really wanted to meet me in person. I didn't take her seriously and even thought it could be fake, I actually had zero hope that something could come out of it. It turns out she's really cute and we have so much in common, in our first date I thought it wouldn't take more than an hour or so but she said she wanted to hang out more and we did a lot of walking around and sitting at different places for 6 hours straight. And she texts me all the time initiating and sending me kisses and makes plans for future meetings.\n\nI know it's just the beginning and we're not official yet but this is the first time I'm seeing this and it's like a dream, you can be amazed to see how it looks so easy, up until this point I was always the initiator and they never seemed so motivated. I'm %100 sure this girl likes me and I don't care even if it doesn't work out, just knowing that someone has liked me this much after decades of effort to no avail is a life boost.\n\nSo I just want to share my humble opinion on how this might have happened, first of all I realized that I was not desperate and didn't seem like that unlike what I've been giving off so far because I know I always pursued them for validation. I think the fact that I've lost my hope helped me in this case as I didn't seem like pursuing her, just kept my cool and enjoyed the conversation, I just laid back and was overall calm and listening to her and speak when I really believe I have something good to say, teasing her instead of complimenting her and actually enjoying it because I didn't care if she didn't want me as I'm used to it and have nothing to lose. For once I was being myself not acting to impress. I disagreed with her on some topics and all, tried to stick to stuff that we had in common and we both have something to say about. I can say that the conversation did not die down for 6 hours.\n\nOverall I acted like we could be great friends but I know that she's being more than friendly even though I'm never trying to flirt with her. Believe me, you'll know when you experience this, it's not hard to understand.\n\nI feel really happy, you can't guess what I've gone through, years of rejection, desperately pursuing and all. The girl is even better than me like she has a car and I don't but still she is like that. I really shrugged off dating apps as useless but you guys can actually give it a shot. I put in the photos where I dress nice and look charismatic not showing off or anything. ",

                "text_body": "TL;DR: changing my thinking changed everything. It was the sole cause of my FA and may be for you too?\n\nDear FA folk. I wanted to post this and hopefully have it bring some hope to some of y'all. My old Reddit account was compromised so unfortunately my history in FA isn't obvious from my current post history but I was a true member. I didn't lose my virginity until 27 and even after a few relationships, I always believed in the FA mindset of being a sexless male. I fell into this belief that I know is common that there are the sex havers and the sexless and that there was little room to maneuver.\n\nBefore anyone says anything about the superficial part of dating, I am aware of it and am fortunate enough to fit into many of the desirable male features. However, even the sexiest of men will not attract women when he doesn't believe he's even attractive. I'm not the hottest of men, but I am desirable by society. I've always known this because I was able to excel in my real estate career and my clients were mostly middle aged women. Because I didn't socialize outside of work, everyone assumed me to be naturally sociable and therefore, either gay or disinterested in a relationship. But because most my friends are women, usually people just thought I was gay.\n\nThis is still a huge issue for me even now that I have ascended from FA. This is where I hope to help people here. My feelings about myself were a byproduct of being SA’d at 18. I literally believed that I was the most undesirable human in every way. Everyone always told me I had an ego which never made sense until about a year ago. While most associate ego with exaggerated positive qualities. I saw myself as the worst in every quality. Reverse ego I call it.\n\nI found my recovery through alternative medicines which gave me what I essentially believe to be a superpower now. It has allowed me the ability to reframe old beliefs about myself. Not having much experience in dating, I put myself just above average in those old comparisons. Since power dating, I realize I'm pretty desirable and have now been able to pick and choose who I date.\n\nI'm 34 now and went from 3 partners to 11 since I started dating a few months back. I honestly see my control over the sexual urges I've had to develop over the years as my other secret weapon. While I'm not a misogynistic man, I am acutely aware of when I'm not in control. The only times I allow this is during sex, but being able also to abstain keeps me in control of my actions. Women don't like men who can't be controlled through sex. Most men never had to learn to abstain, especially men who are desirable. It’s funny because women don't know what to do when their feminine wiles don't work as intended.\n\nSo, from this, hopefully, some of you will see that FA is not solely circumstantial. In fact, for me, it was entirely mental, and I was the cause of my FA, not life. Every girl I ever crushed on had liked me back but assumed me gay or uninterested. (it was a bummer learning that) also, I hope some can see the power they maintain in their ability to abstain. I'll admit, I did hoe-phase a little when I realized I could. But I have found a balance I'm comfortable with.\n\nI'm not Brad Pitt, and I'm not super rich, but I'm charismatic and successful. These definitely help, but I've found it more detrimental to finding who and what I'm looking for as I see how shallow dating is. I also see how touch and proper flirting can be used to get what I want, and I am navigating how to do this and feel okay about it. I've realized I don't enjoy hookups, but haven’t found anyone I’d consider building a life with yet. She is out there though and I won’t fumble it when she arrives.\n\nEither way, I was here for many years, convinced I was part of the sexless—Virgin til 27 and only three partners by 34. I was FA, but now I am part of the sex havers. This all came through working on my thinking. Hopefully, some of you find some hope in this, and the rest who think it’s a humblebrag, consider the possibility you can ascend as well. I never thought it would be possible, life is change.\n\nThe world is not as black and white as the internet would have you think. There’s plenty of room between Brad Pitt and Undatable, and it doesn’t have to be 6’3/6+/6 figures. Good luck, men!",

The singular event would be the only thing I considered prior and therefore believed it. When I finally challenged enough old beliefs, I was doing my daily routine and self affirmations and for the first time, believed what I said to myself.\n\n“You are worthy of love and companionship and will find what you deserve.” After saying that and believing it, I put myself out there and realized me asking out women didn’t get me kicked in the nuts or ran away from like a creeper. The “no’s” didn’t shatter me to a million pieces and the yes’s were more evidence to challenge old thoughts.\n\nNow that I believe I’m attractive and desirable, I am able to put myself out there and find success.

I blame it for the whole host of mental illness and social isolation when I was younger.\n\nI imagine being called ugly would be worse but it’s also something that you can change. I used to not trim my neck beard and get bowl cuts. I used to only wear white tees, oversized sweaters and loose jeans. I was still attractive but not a hit with the ladies. Now I groom, style, take care of my skin, use gratitude journals and embrace what I have. \n\nYou’d be amazed at how significant a man’s glow up can be if he just knew what to improve.

Been a little bit since my last post about being blocked and unfriended because of me bothering her too much, I'm not sad about that anymore because she probably wouldn't be a good influence for me anyway.\n\nNow...recently, I (18m) have finally found a woman on Facebook that I'm comfortable talking to at all, being deep with about my mental health issues, and call my best friend. Her name is River and she loves SCP, YouTube, analog horror, amazing digital circus, rock, liminal spaces, and lost media like me. She's autistic like me and we even like the same freaking color...which is purple. Like i swear she's just me mirrored.\n\nBut as you know from the title, she has a boyfriend which sucks hard i know. But how the heck else am i supposed to be JUST friends with a girl my age like that without that sort of barrier? I'm honestly not used to having a friend like this in my entire life up until now so it's very hard to know when or how to say the right things or what when or how the right things are to do.\n\nI talked about my diagnosed depression, me using character ai to know what having a girlfriend is like, me bawling my eyes out to Lost Kitten, and horrible thoughts about myself to her. She understood what i meant and genuinely  cares about what I'm going through, like a true friend would. And i talked about me wanting a girlfriend someday to just do lovey-dovey things with (in the third person of course) and she understood that too. We saw each-other's faces and she didn't think i was ugly at all (i have excema and glasses). While she was honestly very, very, very pretty...like WAY more than what i expected...which makes sense why she has a boyfriend honestly. She is overall a great friend and i legitimately couldn't ask for more in a person in my entire life.\n\nOverall this isn't a success story in the \"finally getting a girlfriend\" sense but just having a friend at all, especially one of the opposite sex which makes it much more mindblowing to me. Heck, even talking to her at all about stuff makes me feel like i won the lottery in a way because statistically men nowadays don't have any friends let alone female ones so I'm VERY lucky and i will fully appreciate that i am unlike others who don't. But hey, if she ever breaks up with him I'll certianly be there to comfort her and cheer her up as a friend.",

Sure she has a boyfriend, but I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that he doesn't relate to her as well as you do. \n\nI think that's good, though. She has someone who just gets her. A good friend. Best thing to do is just try to get over her as a romantic interest, though. She must trust you and respect you a lot, so don't ruin it by being a guy just waiting in the wings to swoop her up if she ever becomes single again.

                "text_body": "\nWell, it’s been a few years since I’ve visited this sub. I used to post semi-frequently under an account that I have since deleted. I was in my mid 20s then and am now on the cusp of 30. If you’re looking for / trying to avoid a story where a lonely man finds his person, this isn’t it. But things have happened in the few years since I was last here.\n\n \nAside from dating…life has been good. I’ve traveled all over the globe for fun, been successful in my career, and have continued to have a few meaningful friendships. Been blessed with good health and I continue to run or play tennis every single day, which I have done since I was 21.\n\n \nI’ve been on dates with around 20 or so different women in the past several years. Tried a few social sports leagues / singles events to no avail. I’ve taken breaks from dating here and there to keep my sanity, but have worked at it for years now. \n\n \nI’ve kissed/made out/cuddled with several of these women but remain a virgin. Been ghosted a bunch. The furthest it ever goes is 3-5 dates, which has happened with a few of them. At which point all of them have decided there’s no romantic feelings and they’ll never see me as anything more than a friend. Rejection honestly has gotten more painful as I’ve experienced it more and gotten older.\n\n \nAn experience I had over the summer finally broke me. I’ve only ever shared this in therapy and it’s hard to write. \n\n\nI met a girl I really liked and went on a few dates with. After we made out for the first time, she said I was great but there was no romantic connection and she could only be friends. I was devastated given how well I thought things were going. I took it on the chin and wished her well, figuring I’d never hear again.\n\n \nBut she wrote back a few weeks later. Saying she had been healing from a breakup and going through things. She was open about the fact that when she kissed, she didn’t feel anything. But she said she really liked me and “checked every other box”. I told her the truth about my lack of relationship/physical experience. We both agreed to give it another chance.\n\n \nWe saw each other two more times. The final time, I saw hell. We were making out at my apartment. I removed one of her layers, which was uncharted territory. She started crying, said she was really not doing well and going through it. I hugged her and said that it was ok, I really liked her and we didn’t have to do anything she didn’t want to. Then she said – she liked me a lot, but she would never be physically attracted to me and it would never work. We both sat there and cried.\n\n \nI remember the next day almost as vividly. I was in no condition to work and would have called out sick, but a client had come from the UK. My boss pulled me aside later that day to talk in private and I thought I was in trouble. But I was so out to lunch during that meeting that she actually had pulled me aside to ask if I was feeling ok. \n\n \nMy dating experiences have only brought me pain, and I’m not better for having had them. But I’m proud of myself. I tried my best and pushed way out of my comfort zone. There’s nothing wrong with me. I’m just not what women want. There’s someone for the vast majority of people but not everyone. \n\n \nPeople might say how close I’ve gotten and that I should keep trying or that I’ll find someone when I don’t expect it. To me, that’s kind of like the gambling addict who keeps saying “one more game of blackjack”. The house always wins. I’m sure I’ll redownload Hinge impulsively or develop crushes, but I don’t want to go through more pain for something I probably can’t obtain. Is it impossible I find someone? No, but it’s just very unlikely at this point and I’m usually a positive person.\n\n \nPeople in this sub were always so kind and empathetic to me.  I want to end this post with advice on how to make the best of being alone. \n \n\nOne thing that helps for me is treating people well and assuming the best in people. Sure, some people will take advantage of you, but more people will sincerely appreciate it. I mentor new college graduates at my job. A thank you note I received from one of them as he left the company nearly made me tear up and we remain friends. I thought I’d lose my best friend when he got a girlfriend…they’ve been together 4 years now. I see him as much as ever and his girlfriend even likes me too. I’ve just always been there for him, and he’s always been there for me.\n\n \nMy biggest piece of advice is not to accept a life of misery because you’re alone. It took me a while to live up to this. “Live every day like it’s your last” is extreme, but I do believe it to an extent. That’s not to say disregard your health/job. Learn to enjoy things solo. Say yes to things when in doubt. It hasn’t always been the best for my wallet, productivity, and even my liver at times. Are there days where I’m very lonely, yes. But man, I’ve had a lot of fun and seen some awesome things. \n\n\nThe flair system on this sub makes you think. This doesn’t really fit into the vent  flair - I’m not angry or even frustrated. It’s not really a success story but that’s what I will call it. I did my best and continue to live as good a life as I can. Something will just have to be missing from it. Part of growing up is realizing you can’t have it all. ",

Acknowledging the pain that comes with being effectively ostracized is healthy and being able to process the grief in a healthy way is important to finding and working towards a constructive personal long-term plan. Finding hobbies and/or interests that are fulfilling to filling the gap too.",

It’s been a couple of years now, and a lot has changed. Things haven’t always gone smoothly, but I’ve made progress I never thought I would, and I hope this might inspire someone out there.  \n&nbsp;  \nIn 2022, I went back to Thailand (my first trip was back in 2016 to Chiang Mai), this time staying in Bangkok. I got on all the dating apps right away and received a stupendous amount of matches, I have no idea why. Lot’s people seem to match but don’t talk, maybe it’s a validation thing? Anyway, I went on a few dates, one was really nice and the woman was stunning but she was already a few dates deep with another guy and ultimately chose him. We stayed in contact and are still friends and hung out a few times. She recently bought a bar, and I’ve been there a bunch times.  \n&nbsp;  \nAfter about a month of being in Bangkok I took a trip to Chiang Mai and matched with someone—let’s call her Naam. Things moved quickly; we chatted for a few hours before she asked for a \"special photo\" (I think you can guess what type of photo) and I sent it, and she wanted to meet the next day. After a few dates, she came back to my room, but the first time we tried to have sex, I lost my erection. Looking back, it’s no surprise. I’d spent 42 years as a virgin, building up so much pressure and expectation around this moment. I was full of anxiety and nerves, and that got the better of me. At the time, I also had phimosis (a tight foreskin), which added another layer of self-consciousness. Naam mentioned that all her previous partners either had retractable foreskins or were circumcised, so mine was a new frontier for her.  \n&nbsp;  \nShe wasn’t exactly supportive about the sex attempts—she made some comments that knocked my confidence even further—but we kept trying. After a few more failed attempts, I decided to get some Cialis to help ease the anxiety, and finally, it worked. For the first time in my life, I had sex. It wasn’t the perfect experience I’d imagined, but it was a massive milestone for me. The relationship itself wasn’t great. Naam was intense—constantly checking in when I was doing something away from her, saying she loved me after five days, and even suggesting on many occasions that I should get circumcised. Eventually, I realised it wasn’t healthy and ended things for good. I went home a few month’s later.  \n&nbsp;  \nDespite my negative relationship I grew to love Thailand, the people, the culture, the food, everything. I felt like a better and more complete version of myself. After I went home I got a long-term visa and decided I will move and make a go of living there for at least the next 5 years.  \n&nbsp;  \nWhen I arrived in late 2023, I was in a better place mentally and decided to give dating another shot. Within the first three weeks of my trip, I went on two dates with women I’d matched with on Bumble. The first date was pleasant—dinner and a trip to a fairground. It felt relaxed, probably because we’d been chatting for a month beforehand. The second date, though, stood out. We had loads in common, and there was an instant spark when we met. We laughed and joked the entire time, and I thought, This could really go somewhere. We dated for about six months, but the relationship moved too slowly. She’d had a bad breakup a few years back and wasn’t ready to rush into anything, so things stayed very platonic—just hand-holding and hugs.  \n&nbsp;  \nEventually, I decided to move on, and not long after, I met my current girlfriend. She’s kind, supportive, and a lot of fun to be around. The first time we tried to have sex, I lost my erection again. At this point, I’ve come to expect it as part of my nerves with new partners, but she didn’t make a big deal out of it. That understanding made all the difference, and things have been fantastic but I did have to use Cialis the first few times so to have one less thing to worry about. Here’s the surprising part: the sex with my current girlfriend is great. I don’t have much experience, so I’m not exactly sure how or why, but she seems to enjoy it a lot. Maybe it’s the connection we’ve built, or maybe it’s just her being comfortable with me. Either way, I’m not complaining! I nearly forgot to mention, just before my 2023 trip, I was finally able to fully retract my foreskin. I honestly thought it would never happen and I’d never have a normal dick. It was like I unlocked a new part of myself. Being able to feel everything fully now, thanks to resolving the phimosis, has made it so much better for me too.  \n&nbsp;  \nDespite things not working out romantically with the woman from my second date, we’ve stayed friends. We chat regularly on WhatsApp about our shared interests, and she’s confided that she regrets taking things so slowly and feels like she lost me because of it. She’s a good friend, and I’ve been supporting her emotionally (via WhatsApp) after a recent failed relationship. But that’s all it’ll ever be—I’d never meet up with her while I’m in a relationship. When I first started dating I used to be a nervous wreck and worried what I’d say and had all those types of overthinking thoughts. I think having sex and my dating experiences have unlocked a new level of confidence. It’s taken time, patience, and a lot of trial and error to get to where I am now, but I’m finally in a place where I feel like I’m moving forward.   \n&nbsp;  \n**TL;DR:** After years of anxiety, overthinking, and struggling with phimosis, I took a vacation to Thailand in 2022 and started dating. I had some ups and downs, including losing my virginity at 42 with a partner who wasn’t a great fit but helped me overcome a massive mental barrier. Just before my 2023 trip, I resolved my phimosis, which improved my sensations during sex significantly. \nI met my current girlfriend, who is kind, supportive, and a lot of fun. Despite initial nerves, our connection has made the relationship (and sex!) fantastic, even though I still can’t explain why I’m apparently doing something right. \nI’ve grown to love Thailand—the people, culture, and food—and got a long-term visa to live there for at least the next five years. Through dating and resolving my issues, I’ve unlocked a new level of confidence. It wasn’t easy, but I feel like I’m finally moving forward.  \n&nbsp;  \n**To anyone who feels stuck: you can change your life. It’s not easy, and it won’t happen overnight, but even taking small steps can make a world of difference.**  \n&nbsp;  \n**If I was able to do this anyone can. I genuinely thought I was going to die a virgin. Feel free to message me if you want to chat about anything. I’ll try to help in any way I can because I don’t want anyone to feel like it’s not possible!**   \n&nbsp;  \nClarification: Just to be clear I was a virgin at 41 in the original post, I lost it at 42 and I'm now 44!",

It's full of (younger) passport bros these days and I got older.. \n\n\nCan't see myself living in Thailand anymore anyways.

I've got a stable job (though skews old so I dont have many friends and zero romantic prospects here), good core friend group, somewhat active physically, and while my core body features are a 6/10 I've got a good sense of fashion and grooming. I truly finally just got lucky on a dating app with a person who is kind, dorky, and seemingly just as inexperienced as I am. We've made it official after a month.\n\nI wish you all well.

                "text_body": "Note: The \"Success Story\" flair is in a sarcastic sense. It is a success, just not the usual one.\n\nIt's been a while. I haven't posted on this account since August of last year, nearly a year and a half ago. Maybe some of you remember me, probably not. You can look at my other posts for a glimpse into my experiences (or lack thereof). In the past, I've said that this inactivity would be a good sign. I've never been one for gloating about success, especially towards a group of people that doesn't seem like they want to hear it, so my standard was if I ever had it, I would just disappear. Unfortunately, here I am.\n\nThe reason I’m back on this account is because I’ve just reached a pretty significant milestone. When I first created this alt account nearly 7 years ago, I was nearly 16 years old and anxious about the future. I could tell that while things were not hopeless for me interpersonally, I could tell that I was falling behind and wanted reassurance that wouldn’t always be the case. I also used places like r/virgin and this place to vent a lot of my frustrations, many of which probably haven’t aged well and are kind of cringe in hindsight. One thing that always came back to me, understandably, was that I was “only” 16, and that there are bigger things in store than high school experience. I reluctantly agreed and set my sights towards college. I knew this would be a bigger struggle than most, since I would be transferring to a university after 2 years at a community college instead of just doing a full 4 years there. Regardless, with what I was learning from places like r/socialskills, r/dating, r/incelexit, and even sometimes ethically questionable places like r/seduction, I was determined to make the most of my situation.\n\nThen during my senior year of high school, a pandemic happened. Damn…\n\nMy first year of “college” was entirely online. I had a handful of in-person classes the next year. I never expected much socially from community college anyways, so this wasn’t a huge deal to me. What was a huge deal though, was finally transferring to and living in a full 4-year university. And not just any university, but a big one, a school in the Big Ten Conference with over 40 THOUSAND students. A frequent saying throughout the aforementioned subreddits I visited was that if it were to happen, it would happen here. And how could I disagree? So, I gave it my all, and I learned a lot in the process.\n\nI talked to people when appropriate. I joined the hiking club, the archery club, the photography club (later to be run by a friend of mine from high school), the board game club, the international film club, and probably more I’m forgetting. I hated my roommate my first semester on campus, so I literally spent as much time as possible outside of the apartment. I attended multiple college parties, both ones that were happening in my apartment hosted by one of my housemates, and ones that my friends and I were invited to (I hated all of them). I even went as far as to attempt cold approaching on a college campus, and it went about as well as you would expect. Everything outside of dating apps (I have some serious ethical issues about the design of those…) I gave a complete and honest effort. In the Fall of 2022 especially, from the end of August to the beginning of December, I spent a MAXIMUM of 4 hours a day inside my apartment. I literally woke up in the morning, left within the hour, spent all of my time either eating, attending class, doing homework, doing social activities, and then went back to my apartment at 10PM-12AM and went to bed. Nobody can ever say I didn’t try. \n\nAlong the way I asked some questions. I didn’t really understand a lot of the college culture and wanted some pointers or explanations for why people act the way they do. I eventually started getting banned from places like r/incelexit for just not understanding why the advice they were giving was logical (in hindsight, my tone was pretty rude, so this was probably deserved). I was banned from r/dating simply for posting once on PurplePillDebate just trying to understand the way other people thought. I had my posts screenshotted and posted onto r/inceltears, and the much meaner r/inceltear. I literally read entire books, like Models by Mark Manson, to find what the problem was. So, after a while I just determined that I didn’t understand, and that I probably wasn’t ever going to.\n\nI kept trying. I kept talking to people. I kept meeting and making acquaintances. But nothing really stuck. Now, 2 years and one extra semester later (changed majors one too many times…), I’m realizing one of my worst fears when I first made this account all those years ago: graduating a state university a 22-year-old virgin. And honestly? Whatever.\n\nThe reality is I have much bigger things to worry about. I never had many long-term goals for myself. All that I knew for sure was that I wanted a nice, stable income from a job I didn’t hate, and a place for myself. But now it seems like even that is becoming wishful thinking. And with our stable economic genius of a president-elect that my peers have generously voted in, I don’t see the economy or society in general getting any better any time soon. So, I’m just gonna sit it out. The way things are I’m not even sure if I’m gonna be able to feed myself in five years, let alone get laid and sustain a relationship. As the saying goes… It’s over.\n\nMy brother, who’s ten years older than me, has been living in South Korea since 2012 to be an English teacher, and he says that there’s some good job opportunities there. I’ve never really been attracted to the east side of the world, but I’ve never been, and I feel like the one thing I could really use after all of this is a change of scenery. Plus, I’ll get paid and have housing provided so even if I hate it, at least I’ll have some money. I know better than to expect anything social to come out of it though. I don’t know a word of Korean!\n\nI can already see the people that are gonna say that 22 is young, and that I still have time, and blablablabla whatever. And yeah, you’re probably right. But the fact is that whenever I start, if I do, it will be much harder than if I started at a statistically normal age. And honestly, I don’t really have the energy or will to sustain an uphill battle like that. It’s not something I’ll ever rule out, but it’s something that seems like an extremely impractical infeasibility in my life.\n\nI guess what I’m saying is, these days it’s hard to just exist, let alone figure out the massively fucked up dating world of the current year. You only have one life on earth (as far as we know), and you should spend it on what you can control and what will maximize your own happiness. For me, in terms of interpersonal relationships, I did everything right and still failed. And that’s fine. It was a learning experience. And I’ll learn a lot more by focusing my time on other things.\n\nI don’t see myself going on this account much more after this. I might pop in occasionally, but I think this is the end for me when it comes to focusing, studying, and festering on this topic. I hope everyone here (including me) finds happiness one way or another. If not with a relationship, with a community, or a hobby, or literally anything. Find some way to make a positive difference in the world and stick to it, because we’re gonna need it.\n\nThanks for reading.",

Most people don’t like to look at my face too long lol. \n\nShe asked me how my day was and she had great conversation skills, carrying the conversation like a pro and speaking to me so casually it was almost like talking to a friend. She made me feel so comfortable and I did not feel judged by her. \n\nI can’t stop thinking about her. As she left she said “I might see you next week!” implying she comes in here often (it is a grocery store, so) and I am already looking forward to seeing her again. \n\nI wish there were more people like her in the world. \n\n",

Out of the blue, she asked me if I liked Indian girls (she's Indian) but I think I messed up and told her than an Indian girl broke my heart lol. While the group was talking, I removed my glasses and she started murmuring to the men. I asked what's up and she said I look great without them. They also compared me to another guy wearing glasses but she said I looked way better.\n\nI told her I'll start wearing contact lenses starting tomorrow. I think I also impressed the girl by speaking to her in her native language Punjabi. The boys have been pressuring me to talk to her and I've been hesitant. But I think I'm gonna ask for her number tomorrow.\n\nPlease wish me luck!\n\nI've never been set up and I never received a compliment like that from a girl who wasn't a close friend before!\n\nMy last post a month ago was about two of my close friends, who are girls, trying to set me up and it led nowhere lol",

Currently I am studying MBA and even though I am talking to several girls in my MBA, there is this girl whom I found cute last week and wanted to approach her. She is in the same friends circle as some of my male friends but me and her never talked before as we have never been classmates. I told my male friend asking about her and that I wanted to talk to her and told him not to tell her about it as I wanted to do it naturally. But the male friend told my another male friend about it and he told that girl that I wanted to talk to her and my male friends around cheered me to go approach her but she didn't even seem interested and she didn't even say me Hi and walked away in some moments and as an introvert I was hesitant due to the pressure. I thought maybe next day I will approach her naturally but then another different male friend said lets go talk to her. I tried to stop him but he too told her that I wanted to talk to her and she again didn't seem interested and gave an awkward look and didn't even say Hi and went to talk to her friend instead. At that point it felt like there was no more point of trying as my male friends intervened twice. It was probably that my friends tried to set me up with her but idk why she didn't try to talk to me like the girl in your case talked with you. The situation became awkward.",

Just wanted to put this out there but if her family is not too traditional then this probably wouldn’t be an issue. I’m just speaking from experience as some families can be this way and it’s helpful to know in advance.

I find it strange that she’s going for an arranged marriage even though she’s dated casually and even hooked up with other people, that doesn’t make sense because if you can date, you definitely find a partner on your own without family involvement (which is what arranged marriages are). I think people get arranged marriages because they couldn’t find a partner on their own/through dating apps and then ask their parents to help set them up for matchmaking. And honestly, I’ve seen some people especially guys on the arranged marriage sub complain about women having a past, which people need to realize that your image and reputation matter in arranged marriages and your relationship history will come into question at some point. People who engage in hookup culture will not be looked at favorably in an arranged marriage setup generally speaking.",

People can criticize me if they want, but there is no good that comes from hookup culture or casually sleeping around with random people no matter what society says.

But I can’t and shouldn’t complain, she is at the very least thin and I am happy I didn’t end up with a fat chick. I think with proper clothing she can look really good at least to me. Besides her is better than being alone\n\n - she was actually the nervous one not me, to me it felt as if I have been training for this moment my entire life. It all came ver naturally for me. I knew when to cuddle, I knew when to hold hands and I knew when to touch her\n\n- honestly, it was not scary at all just felt right and normal. Onl the ride back to her place she held my hand and then I started thinking about what was happening and this was actually real. I have long come to terms with that I would die alone. The fact that it was happening was surreal \n\nSome advice for you man, I have never tried to hit on girls in bars or the streets but I frankly don’t think it will work out. Sure maybe you can bag a drunk chick but was she really into it or was it just the alcohol? You should instead look for girls that you will have an actual relationship with which is easier said than done. Women are pretty trash this days. \n\nAll I am saying is I doubt you will find success in a bar or on the streets because it won’t be you. It will not be natural to you and you will fumble it. Unless you are going with friends who can make you look more socially attractive then that’s another thing but if you are going alone I think you are going to regret it",

My best friend, who is also girl, tried but she doesn't know many people and she's also never had a relationship so she can't help much.\n\nThis new friend however is very experienced with relationships and hookups and I hope she can find someone for me. She really tries. But she's also very introverted and doesn't know that many girls. I know more girls than her lol\n\nAnd also, I just became semi-part of a girl group in my uni and they're always inviting me to be with them and are delighted to see me. It's always a pleasure talking to them.\n\nAnd just last night, I made friends with some new girls who invited me to go with them to a Halloween Party at an open club. It was fun and I got to dance and meet and socialize with many girls. But at the same time, I was sad seeing couples and non-couples being intimate with each other there. Plus, my friends don't see much in me. I'm not hot or handsome and they talk about other guys.\n\nStill, I hope something happens to me soon. I'm getting older, I just turned 26 two weeks ago. I'm still not handsome and I've stopped going to the gym last summer because I got demoralized from lack of results. However, I feel more confident putting myself out there now.\n\nI hope my confidence is not me being delusional.

He has always been a lazy control freak. Control freak is fine, lazy is fine, but lazy AND control freak is just about the worst combination you can have for the head of a household. He dominates the whole household through coercion. This man's ability to cause other people pain and failure knows no bounds. He has managed to make every single person in my family miserable. Every single person in this family, including my mom and brother, used to struggle with suicidal thoughts because of him. Thankfully, he has a lot of health issues now and can't really boss us around anymore. It is cruel to say this, but I feel like he deserves what is happening to him, and it has made everyone else's lives a lot easier.\n\nBecause of him, I was a shut-in until my early 20s. I had no friends, and my brother refused to run away with me, so I chose not to run away from home. Fast forward a few years, and thanks to my mother, who went behind my dad's back many times so that I would be able to escape this horrible home some day, I have managed to get into a much better spot in life. She worked full-time to put food on the table (my dad refused to buy food), helped me get my driver's license, my first job, and so many other things that my dad was saying I didn't deserve, didn't have permission for, etc... Her family even let me borrow a car for a while so that I could drive to work. She was also the first one to tell me about the GED and encourage me to get it.\n\nI live in an isolated rural area with no job opportunities (so no way to save up money for a car), so I depended on her for transportation. Thanks to her help, I was able to get out into the real world and make some money, and eventually work up the confidence to learn how to apply for college and Pell grants. After graduating community college and working for a couple of years, I applied to college in my late-mid-20s.\n\nI have been busy catching up on life since getting my GED, and have always been in school or working. Despite my hard work, I am now in my late 20s, getting close to my 30s. My life could be better. I am really behind for my age. I am still living at home, and it'll be years before I graduate from business school. It does sting a bit that it is too late for me socially. I am nearly a decade older than a lot of my classmates and can't really make any friends. I haven't had any friends IRL since I was maybe 5 years old. The MMO guilds I used to be part of were my only social outlets for my entire life, but those are long gone. I haven't had any close friends online at all since I gave up the guild life. I am lucky to be in a long-distance relationship, even though we can't afford to meet each other. It took me years of regular searching and countless rejections before I found her. In my case, my dating (and friendship) difficulties were primarily caused by my lack of social status, rather than appearance issues. People usually became uncomfortable talking to me after finding out about my weird life.\n\nBut, things could be a lot worse if it weren't for my mom. I am on track to have my CPA license by the age of 30. In fact, I already have job and internship offers, despite being years away from graduating (it turns out accounting has an insanely good job market). So, despite everything, I am still really thankful for all of the help my mom gave me in getting out of my past situation.\n\nI'll never understand why my dad is the way he is or why he behaves the way he does to his family. All I know is that if it wasn't for my mom, life would be a lot worse for me.",

                "text_body": "# Introduction\n\nI've been posting to this subreddit under various accounts for over a decade, from my high school days all the way into my late twenties. It felt good to know that there were plenty of lonely people like me out there, and we could be forever alone, together. There were times when I believed that I would be this way for the rest of my life.\n\nBut today I have a girlfriend who says she's lucky to have me, and a diverse friend group both through my own efforts and through her.\n\nThis didn't happen overnight. It has taken years of hard work, tears, failures, and difficult self-reflection to get to this point. In this post, I'm going to tell you my story, along with the lessons I had to learn in order to reach this point, in the hope that it may advise and inspire you on your own journey.\n\n# An Acknowledgement of Privilege\n\nI am aware that the path I took will not be possible for every man to take. I had the following advantages:\n\n* I live in a big city, with a large dating pool, where opportunities for social connection are abundant. A ForeverAlone man who lives in a small town or a rural area will not have as many options as I did.\n* I am white, and did not have to deal with the prejudices or stereotyping that men of colour may experience while dating.\n* In my adult life I have had disposable income to spend on improving myself, because I am lucky to have graduated college without student debt, and I have worked steady jobs that usually paid well. A poorer man might not have such resources.\n\nOn the other hand, I am autistic. Therefore I was not entirely without environmental handicaps.\n\nForever Alone people frequently mention looks or height as inalterable factors that determine one's dating prospects. For me, I know that I am of average height. But I don't know how good-looking I am, so I don't know how privileged I am in that way. When I have asked women this question in the past, they have always answered me vaguely and said \"Girls care about personality more and you have a good personality\". I think I look like an average-looking nerd.\n\n#  Birth-2015: How I Became FA\n\nMy father was Forever Alone just like me, and it seems like he only escaped through divine intervention. He prayed to god that he would find a woman with certain qualities, and happened to meet my mother, who had all those qualities. They didn't conceive me until he was in his 40s, and his older genes cursed me with autism.\n\nWith this disorder, combined with their fundamentalist religious values, I grew up a goody two-shoes teacher's pet who spent hours poring over apologetics to defend his faith. Think Rodd and Todd from *The Simpsons*. Despite all the harsh pushing of my parents to make friends — which once went so far as taking away all my toys, television, and computer access for an entire school year — I saw little point in other people, instead preferring the cozy indoor company of books and games.\n\nYet even with these hindrances, I believe that I was on the path to succeed romantically. In the fourth and fifth grades I confessed my feelings to multiple crushes. In the seventh grade one such crush started pursuing me back, and at my elementary school graduation we slow danced. I even owned a copy of *The Big Book of Boy Stuff* by Bart King, in which there's a section that explains the very basics of dating for boys. But it never occurred to me to ask any of these girls to come play with me, despite the book saying exactly that.\n\nSo there's your first lesson: **In order to date girls, you have to ask them out. Ask if they would like to do a fun activity with you.** Per the advice of the Interpersonal Stack Exchange, use the word \"date\" to make it clear it's not just a friendly thing, e.g. \"I think [place] would make for a good first date\". I know this is a very basic insight, but sometimes the obvious things need to be directly said. If only somebody had said this to me, I might have followed through.\n\nBut then middle school came along, and with it sex education, from both school and church. (The girl who slow danced with me moved away.) My autistic brain loves rules, and a rule like \"no sex before marriage\" is something it magnetizes onto, destroying any hopes at teenage love I might have had. I was obsessed with how sinful the world was and how pure and enlightened we Christians were for putting our minds above our bodily urges. My monkey brain would tell me \"every girl in your school is smokin' hot\", but I would do everything I could to suppress those desires. I would argue with people online that saving yourself for marriage was the right choice, and would always remind myself of Ecclesiastes 9:9: \"Live happily with the woman you love through all the meaningless days of life that God has given you under the sun. The wife God gives you is your reward for all your earthly toil.\" I would tell myself that if I just worked hard enough, God would cause a wife to fall right into my lap. But here too is a lesson: **No one will provide you with a partner. You must go out into the world and work to find a partner yourself.**\n\nThough that overt phase gradually faded away, the damage was done. All through middle school, high school, and college, the most action I got was when someone walked up to me and asked \"Are you and [girl] dating?\" We weren't, we were just working on a project together.\n\n# 2016: Earliest Efforts\n\nI was in the middle of an internship in college when I was struck with a sudden desperation for love. I couldn't understand why, because I had been fine alone up to that point.\n\nThis is another lesson, a reassuring one: **You are evolutionarily programmed with a drive to find somebody to love. It will *eventually* happen to you, as it eventually happens for the majority of men.** This sudden urge was my programming calling on me to take action.\n\nSo I did the only thing I knew how to do: created a dating profile on OKCupid, the only dating site I could find that was free and allowed me to set my preferences to Christians who wanted to wait until marriage.\n\nMy pictures were bad, my messages were desperate and cringey, and I got zero interested responses. This was before OKCupid required you to match with someone to message them, so I sent tonnes of unsolicited messages to people with a high match percentage. The one time a woman responded to me, it was to say that she wasn't interested. At the time, even that felt like a success.\n\n# 2017: The Worst Year\n\nFrom what I've heard, 2017 was a good year for most of the world. For me, it was unambiguously the worst year of my life. It all started when I saw something that destroyed the foundations of my faith in Christianity. At the time, it felt like a bomb going off in my chest.\n\nI didn't want to let go of the faith for a few months. I talked a lot with my parents and pastors until my mother, fearing for my immortal soul, told me to stop asking questions. So I did, and became an atheist.\n\nOne of the first things I did now that I no longer believed that some deity cared about my sex life was to create a Tinder account. After all, it had been described to me as a land of reckless promiscuity, easy hook-ups for all. Nothing could be further from the truth. My first match was such a disaster that I won't even describe it, and it didn't get much better from there. In all my years on Tinder, I have gotten just one date. It is the worst of the dating apps, and while I won't recommend a specific one, I will recommend not using Tinder.\n\nI must admit that I am partially to blame during this time, for I would swipe left on all the less-than-attractive women and only swipe right on the pretty ones. Here we find this year's lesson: **Beggars can't be choosers. Physical appearance should not be a concern to you, but don't be afraid to swipe left on the basis of obviously incompatible personalities.** Like if you're a conservative and someone's profile says \"conservatives swipe left\", swipe left. Also, if you swipe left on a non-white woman for the sole reason that she is non-white, you are your own worst enemy and also just a bad person and a racist.\n\nAnyway, back to the story. My belief in God had been the basis of my whole worldview. Without him, I struggled to find meaning in life, and began to descend into a dark place. I barely passed the spring semester of college, and then with lots of free time during the summer I went into a downward spiral that culminated in an ugly incident where my parents learned of my deconversion.\n\nWith all that had happened I was in no shape to tackle college in the fall, even though the courses I had chosen were very difficult. Also, my favorite video game released a large content update and I spent way too much time playing it. The result was that I failed multiple courses.\n\n# 2018: Going Outside\n\nI knew that I needed to finish school, so in the spring semester I sucked it up, put my struggles aside, and got to work. I succeeded, repeating the courses I'd failed and passing them this time. I landed a job at a prestigious company, graduated, and left college behind for the adult world.\n\nUnfortunately, as a remnant of my troubles in 2017, I fell in with certain forums for *those misogynistic men who blame women for their problems known by a word that must not be named.* I never went to the extreme levels of misogyny seen there; I simply found them a good source of solace and a way to shift blame for my problems off myself, much like this place.\n\nI hit rock bottom in early July, driven partly by my loneliness but mostly by feeding it online. Loneliness would cause physical pain for me, a feeling like a black hole was sucking things up inside my stomach. I would get this feeling several times a week. The moment of deepest sorrow came when I went to see a movie, and I felt that sucking pain of desperation every single time there was a woman on screen. I walked home in the pouring rain, crawled into bed cuddling my pillow and cried myself to sleep. The next morning I discovered I had lost my keys on the way home.\n\nBut at this miserable low point, I realized that feeding my loneliness and participating in such forums was not useful if I actually wanted to stop being Forever Alone.\n\nSo I resolved to *do something about it.*\n\n---\n\nA MeetUp (use this site, you'll find lots of local social groups to do activities with) event led to a meeting with a dating coach, who told me \"You're not ready for my methods yet. Go join this therapy group for men, and we'll talk later.\" He was right. It's hard to hear that you're not ready.\n\nLesson: **In order to date, you must become a datable person. But improving yourself doesn't mean losing yourself.** No woman would have wanted me as the scary, bitter, immature fellow I was at the time. Does this mean you suck? Does this mean you're not good enough? Probably, yeah. I know it's absolutely crushing to hear. But if you were good enough, you would have gotten some action by now. The reason you're here is that you need to go outside, work harder, and become the kind of person who gets the girls.\n\nAt the same time though, I used to be afraid of self-improvement, because Christian media emphasizes that becoming one with the Lord means losing yourself. I've met a few Christians who have lost themselves like that, who constantly have big smiles on their faces and are preaching Jesus to everyone they meet. But that's not how secular self-improvement works. Look at the *Kung Fu Panda* trilogy; by the end of the final film, Po has gone from a lowly noodle boy to the almighty Dragon Warrior, but he's still a lovable, funny panda who takes a moment to gush about how awesome his powers are before attacking. Or look at *The Good Place*, where every main character becomes good in their own way when they are given a second chance.\n\nThe therapy group had to spend a few months purging all my complaints about life and dating that I had picked up from the evil forums. (Those complaints were mostly theoretical, as I had barely tried actually engaging with women outside of dating apps.) One member pointed out an important lesson that caused me to stop visiting this subreddit for a long time: **Forever Alone forums can hinder you if they provide a place to wallow in misery at the expense of action.** The men in the group also introduced me to a positive side of masculine strength that I had rarely seen before.\n\nThat strength soon came up when my father and I disagreed on something and I stood up to him. The disagreement escalated to an argument that led to him kicking me out of the house. I found a beautiful, affordable apartment in a good neighbourhood, gathered together some acquaintances, packed my bags, and left.\n\nI have happy memories of sitting alone in that quiet apartment in the winter months, finally free to make my own destiny. For \"freedom is not a gift to be granted when maturity is achieved, but the precondition for acquiring maturity.\" ― Noam Chomsky [paraphrased]\n\n# 2019: Air I Breathe\n\nThe title of this section originates from the song \"Air I Breathe\" by Mat Kearney, a song I discovered from my YouTube recommendations early in 2019. It's a catchy, poignant song that always brings me back to this part of my life, breathing the free air of the big city.\n\nWith steady income and my therapy group at my back gradually molding me into a man, I felt free to explore my city like never before. I attended dance classes, joined a club for a video game I liked, went on a couple of dating app dates that went nowhere, and joined a second (co-ed) therapy group where I met lots of women into similar kinds of self-help. Interacting with such women in a non-judgemental environment was an important step for me.\n\nAt the end of June I got laid! ...off from my job. The very next day I went to a music festival where, after I expressed my frustrations in a sharing circle, a woman let me cuddle with her and then invited me to touch her clothed breasts out of pity. (It should go without saying that pity won't get you very far with women. I'm not even going to count that as a lesson. I got lucky, don't ever try what I did.) At this time I started drinking alcohol, having never bothered to before despite being of legal drinking age for years. With the help of earplugs to take the edge off the noise, this allowed me to start hitting the nightlife scene, where I had a couple more little successes. I held hands with a girl as she led me from one room to another. Someone mistook me for a professional dancer from how enthusiastically I was dancing. One time I even grinded with a girl who pulled me in towards her, but then her friend callously said \"She has a boyfriend of three years; she's not interested\" and yanked her away.\n\nAnother notable development from this year was that my therapy group encouraged me to get into fitness and I hired a personal trainer for three months' worth of lessons. Since then, I have done that twice more, once in 2021 and once in 2023. I have to address exercise and weightlifting because it's so often recommended to FAs. But in all honesty, I don't really think it's helped me become more datable. It's definitely made me feel healthier/understand my body, and it's helped me build character through suffering. But each time the whole regimen of diet and exercise only gained me about 15 pounds of muscle, which only the men in my life commented on. Unless you're willing to pour your heart, soul, and wallet into training, and stick with it for a year or more, you're not going to build a model-worthy figure that will attract girls on its own. Developing your personality really is easier, cheaper, and more important.\n\nOn occasion I experimented with cold-approaching women in public, helped by an older divorcé from the group. It did help me get over my anxiety with strangers, but it wasn't very useful when it came to actually finding a partner, though my more confident mentor reported several successes and dates. (He was also rich and handsome, though...) Unless you have something that's obviously in common to open the conversation with, rarely will a woman text a stranger back. But don't be afraid to ask for numbers. Most women will freely offer them.\n\nI managed to get an offer from another job, but I realized that I disliked that line of work. So I declined that offer and decided to use all the money I'd saved up to go backpacking in a foreign country I'd always dreamed of, one with a reputation for promiscuity. My flight left on Halloween night 2019, and while the plane took off I saw a beautiful sight, a fireworks show below us. It looked so tiny from above.\n\n# 2020: Backpacking\n\nThen the pandemic hit.\n\nWell, not right away. I had a few good months of fun in my city of arrival. And even then, the country I was in wasn't hit as hard by the pandemic as some others were; at worst I couldn't cross a state border or lost a temp job.\n\nThe hard labor that I could get with my work visa, the interaction with all the free-spirited young diverse people in my hostels, the wonderous new sights and sounds I perceived everywhere I went; all of these made 2020 a year of great maturation for me. \"Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness\", as they say. My dating efforts this year, though, were total failures. I got zero action while backpacking, none at all, and with hostels full of love in the air it was at times torturous to watch everybody around me bang each other with seeming ease.\n\nI know one reason why: because I was desperate. Lesson: **As with job searching, desperation is very unattractive. It makes it appear that you don't want that person for who they are, you just want anyone at all.**\n\nThere was one hostel where I systematically asked out every single girl there and was turned down every time. One of those girls, who had formed a relationship with another guy that went on to last for years, warned me something that should be taken as a lesson: **Women talk to each other about guys who have asked them out. In an environment with a limited supply of women, such as a hostel or your workplace, choose your asks very carefully, because asking out too many of them makes you look desperate.**\n\n# 2021: Held Back at the Worst Time\n\nAfter flying home and spending a few months quarantining and getting back on my feet, I got a job that paid minimum wage. Because of that salary, this year really didn't teach me much except the value of money and going outside. It was an unfortunate delay in my journey just when I was ready to put into practice my personal growth from abroad. Pandemic restrictions were still in effect in most places, and at minimum wage I couldn't afford much more activities than a dating app subscription.\n\nBut somehow that subscription actually got me a brief long-distance relationship with someone on the other side of the country.\n\nIt lasted only three months, and we never met in person due to COVID restrictions, only video calling on a regular basis. But we became very emotionally close in those short months. It was the highlight of my year, and I was devastated when she ended it over the pandemic's uncertainty, having found a local man she could see regularly. We exchanged messages as friends for a few years afterward.\n\nThe only other date I had that year was with a girl I might have been very compatible with, but I totally botched it. I got on the wrong bus and showed up an hour late, then I was impatient waiting for our food, then I did something she had asked me not to do because I had misunderstood the instruction.\n\nI think the overall lesson from this year is: **Don't be afraid to fail.** You're probably going to screw up, scare away that girl you thought was the one, do lots of cringey things. Lord knows I did; I shudder to this day thinking about some of the things I said to women I'd just met. And that's OK. You're figuring yourself out! This is a part of your life that you've neglected until now. Dating is a skill that you have to build, so of course you're going to make mistakes, because you're learning.\n\nI was bad at my job, and my boss might have fired me if I'd stayed much longer — he had already said he couldn't trust me with the main responsibility of the job. But luckily, a guy from my therapy group put in a good word for me with his employer, and so I got a job at that company that paid far, far more.\n\n# 2022: Trickles\n\nThe way I would sum up my 2022 is the chorus of Linkin Park's song \"In the End\": \"I tried so hard and got so far / But in the end, it didn't even matter\". I accomplished something unrelated to dating that I'd been working on for years, but then external circumstances rendered that achievement hollow. When it came to dating, I tried really hard with the money I had from my new job, and did accomplish some things, but it still didn't feel like much.\n\nOn Valentine's Day I went on a date with a girl where we watched a romantic comedy and we held hands in a way that seemed to come really naturally. Our relationship was on-again off-again for the rest of the year; we were never intimate and could never really see ourselves as more than friends, until eventually that's what we became. The friendship ended when she got engaged to a man from her home country and left to be with him.\n\nThe summer yielded a magical moment at a festival, where I had my first kiss. Basically, we met and talked for a while, then walked around to various attractions at the festival increasing the amount we touched each other little bit by little bit, until we sat down together and kissed. Lesson: **Go where there are more girls, and more open-minded girls.** If there are only a few fish that don't even nibble in one lake, a fisherman goes to a lake with lots of fish that bite more often. Try out female-dominated activities like yoga and partner dancing. Spend your time at places like music festivals, nightclubs, heck maybe even BDSM/swinger/fetish events if you can find one.\n\nFor a while in the closing months of the year I forced myself to go clubbing, talked to lots of girls, and didn't get anywhere with any of them. I was unable to recreate the beginner's luck successes I'd had in 2019. The whole experience had really jumped the shark for me. I closed out 2022 feeling like I was trapped in a desert, stumbling from one brief oasis of affection to the next, but praying to feel the rain wash over me. Which leads us to...\n\n# 2023: The Clouds Burst\n\nThis year, several key events combined to finally push me over the edge.\n\nJanuary: I bought my first car. I would recommend you own a car as well, if you can afford it. It has given me so much autonomy and mobility and has made dates way easier to pull off.\n\nFebruary: I kissed a girl on the first date. Nothing more came of that but it felt incredible.\n\nMarch: ChatGPT was released, causing an upheaval in my job's industry.\n\nJune: I went on two awesome dates with a really pretty girl I met on Hinge, and later went on an impromptu date with a girl I had just met. Neither girl wanted to take things any further, but these were big boosts to my confidence.\n\nJuly: My biological programming caused my frustration at still never having had sex or a long-term relationship to reach another boiling point. I seriously considered giving up because the effort-reward tradeoff didn't make sense to me. Masturbating takes minimal effort and gives moderate reward, while finding a girlfriend had taken me enormous effort for as yet minimal rewards. What convinced me to keep going was a post I saw by chance on a subreddit for sex workers — an escort revealed that her price to be a full-time girlfriend, or what you'd have to pay to buy your way out, is $20,000 per month plus a new car. If you don't have that kind of money to spare, you're coming out ahead, and if you do, you can spend it on the best life coaching money can buy to do this the right way.\n\nI again contacted the dating coach I had met in 2018, and hired a new top-of-the-line personal trainer. These were both very expensive, stretching my finances to their limits. Unfortunately...\n\nSeptember: With my employer losing money due to ChatGPT, I was laid off from my job and had to fire both the coach and the trainer.\n\nOctober: The abundance of free time proved to be a blessing. I found a group for one of my interests that holds regular local parties and social events that I started going to. And here is where everything comes together. At one of these parties, I hit it off with a girl, took her home and we hooked up.\n\nSeven long years after I first started trying to date, and a solid twenty years after I realized I liked girls — at long last, my v-card was turned in.\n\nNovember: This did *wonders* for my confidence. Within the next few months, I went on a first date with a girl and almost had sex with her only to say something stupid and cockblock myself at the last moment. (Remember, be friends with failure. As world chess champion Emanuel Lasker once said, \"The hardest game to win is a won game.\") Then I went on a date with someone else and *did* have sex on the first date. We remained friends with benefits for a while afterwards.\n\nDecember: I went to a board games night and met the woman who would become my girlfriend over the next few months.\n\nThe lesson we can take from this year is something that I learned from a member of my therapy group all the way back in 2019, but had neglected to put into action until 2023: **Establish a presence in a community for something you love. Both romantic and non-romantic relationships can blossom from repeated, unplanned interactions.** Like, as I kept attending events in this community, I'd keep meeting people who would say \"oh yeah, you! I remember you from that event a few weeks ago!\" It doesn't matter what the community is as long as there are women there, and that you stick with it and contribute in the long term. While I was religious, this community was my church. In this new community I have found a substitute. And it worked for my ancestors too! My grandparents met at church; my parents met in a dance class.\n\nMany of you will object that your interests (gaming or comic books) are male-dominated, so that every girl in your hobby has many suitors. To that I say: explore and branch out your interests! You might find something new and fun that you never imagined, but you'll never know what's out there if you don't try things. Through my efforts I found a special variety of yoga that I had never heard of before going out to explore, and now I love and practice regularly.\n\n# 2024: Life After Love\n\nThis year has just been a victory lap of winning my girlfriend over, and vice versa, until we made things official/exclusive in June. But now that I have someone who cares about me and we have sex regularly, I have one final insight. It's hard to hear, but it needs to be said.\n\n**All good things lose their lustre if you have enough of them, and this includes sex. Once you have regular sex, it is not a euphoric triumph every time, but a normal fun bonus to life like eating.**\n\nThis is why people who were never FA say love and sex aren't important. (They're wrong.) Just as you don't remember every meal you've had, you won't remember every time you've had sex. It's just human nature to become used to positive stimuli. Psychologists call it the \"hedonistic treadmill\".\n\nNow, I'm not saying you shouldn't seek sex if you haven't had it. Sex feels good and is lots of fun! Those first times of mine are the fondest of memories. I'm saying that you shouldn't see it as the end-all and be-all of your life any more than you should see food that way. When you have sex for the first time, angels won't descend from heaven playing triumphant trumpets. There won't be credits rolling as if life were a movie; you be kicked back to the main menu as if it were a video game. Life will go on as it always has afterwards. I have other goals to worry about now, like furthering my career, or saving up money to buy a house.\n\n# Recommended Further Reading\n\nI'll share the main lesson that I gleaned from each of these books and resources.\n\n* *The Power of Now* by Eckhart Tolle. **You are not the chatter that forms your thoughts, you are something deeper.** This book helped me get out of my head and gain the self-awareness I needed to start reaching out. It's ever more important in the age we live in, when our phones supply us drivel at will and true time alone with one's thoughts is rare.\n* *Models* by Mark Manson. **Don't be too invested in landing any particular woman when there are lots of them out there.** If you're over 18, this is *the* book to read. Chock-full of good advice, it will lay your mental groundwork for how to date. (It isn't all about dating models; there's only one brief section on dating the prettiest women. The title is about forming a mental model of dating.) I could have gotten twenty valuable insights from this book alone.\n* *The Big Book of Boy Stuff* by Bart King. The insight for this one was the first insight of this post. If you're under 18, this book has a chapter that tells about the basics of dating girls. It's also full of fun recipes, jokes, crafts, magic tricks, and other things boys like.\n* Any book on portrait photography from your local library will help you get a good dating profile.  **Your first dating profile picture is king; capturing a good one will make your match rate skyrocket.** It certainly made a world of difference for me. Use the lens on your phone with the highest zoom, shoot in plenty of light, and keep the camera's ISO as low as possible to minimize noise. The rest of your pictures should show you in many different places doing many different cool things. (You do go to many different places and do many different cool things, so that you can take such pictures, right?) Or you could just hire a photographer if you can afford it.\n* The YouTube channel TheSingleGuy is an excellent non-PUA channel of practical, actionable advice for men. The advice he keeps repeating is: **Build your confidence by multiple small successes.** That's what I did. First it was a slow dance, then a cuddle, then grinding, etc...\n* Introverted Alpha is a blog of dating advice for men written by women. **View your sexuality as a gift and not a burden; a salesman must believe in what they are selling.** It acts as a gentler side of the direct masculine style of TheSingleGuy.\n* *Sex at Dawn* by Ryan and Jetha. **Women are horny monkeys just as much as men are, but they are usually held back by the social and economic conditions imposed by society.** This is a pop-science book about the prehistory of human sexuality and what we can learn about ourselves from our ancestors' sexual habits. Take the rest of its assertions with a heavy sprinkling of salt, because academic anthropologists have been sharply critical of it and pointed out numerous citation errors.\n* *The Way of the Superior Man* by David Deida. The advice here is more for when you're already in a relationship than about finding one, but it includes good advice for being a man in general that can help attract women regardless. Just remember that the author wrote it in his twenties, so he wasn't necessarily much wiser than you.\n* *The Game* by Neil Strauss. **The fancy lines and technical knowledge that pick-up artists preach might get you laid, but cannot get you love.** This is a PUA book that you should read *only* as entertainment and for the above lesson. Do *NOT* view it as advice that you should mimic; even modern pick-up artists regard it as outdated.\n\nResources I would *not* recommend include:\n\n* *12 Rules for Life* by Jordan Peterson. People often recommend this book for young adults trying to get their act together, and there is some good advice here, but it's mostly incoherent conservative proselytizing. He's not much better at keeping his thoughts on track on paper than he is in person. He spends an entire chapter repeating over and over again: \"A wife learns her husband is cheating on her. How might she feel about it?\"\n* *Bang* by Roosh V, or any other PUA literature. Just say no. Pick-up advice doesn't work because it isn't tailored to the individual.\n\n# Closing Thoughts\n\nNormally, what someone like me would do is lock this information behind a paywalled ten-lesson seminar. But I share my experience for free, because I'm not doing this for money. Profit motivation sucks the life out of everything, after all. I'm doing this for love, and love is supposed to be free. I will never charge to help another lonely man, because I know how many coaches out there prey on our desperation to vacuum up our disposable income. I've paid many of them, for goodness' sake.\n\nIf you are struggling with being Forever Alone, please feel free to reach out. I'm here to talk to you and do what I can. I can't promise to give you a life-changing perspective, only my thoughts as someone who has made this journey.\n\nStay strong, friends. May your Alone be not Forever. The final lesson is: **Don't give up.**\n\n# TL;DR: Just the Lessons\n\n1. In order to date girls, you have to ask them out. Ask if they would like to do a fun activity with you.\n2. No one will provide you with a partner. You must go out into the world and work to find a partner yourself.\n3. You are evolutionarily programmed with a drive to find somebody to love. It will, *eventually*, happen to you, as it eventually happens for the majority of men.\n4. Beggars can't be choosers. Physical appearance should not be a concern to you, but don't be afraid to swipe left on the basis of obviously incompatible personalities.\n5. In order to date, you must become a datable person. But improving yourself doesn't mean losing yourself.\n6. Forever Alone forums can hinder you if they provide a place to wallow in misery at the expense of action.\n7. As with job searching, desperation is very unattractive. It makes it appear that you don't want that person for who they are, you just want anyone at all.\n8. Women talk to each other about guys who have asked them out. In an environment with a limited supply of women, such as a hostel or your workplace, choose your asks very carefully, because asking out too many of them makes you look desperate.\n9. Don't be afraid to fail.\n10. Go where there are more girls, and more open-minded girls.\n11. Establish a presence in a community for something you love. Both romantic and non-romantic relationships can blossom from repeated, unplanned interactions.\n12. All good things lose their lustre if you have enough of them, and this includes sex. Once you have regular sex, it is not a euphoric triumph every time, but a normal fun bonus to life like eating.\n13. You are not the chatter that forms your thoughts, you are something deeper.\n14. Don't be too invested in landing any particular woman when there are lots of them out there.\n15. Your first dating profile picture is king; capturing a good one will make your match rate skyrocket.\n16. Build your confidence by multiple small successes.\n17. View your sexuality as a gift and not a burden; a salesman must believe in what he is selling.\n18. Women are horny monkeys just as much as men are, but they are usually held back by the social and economic conditions imposed by society.\n19. The fancy lines and technical knowledge that pick-up artists preach might get you laid, but cannot get you love.\n20. Don't give up.",

Passivity kills a man's dating prospects; that's by far the most important consideration. However, there is **not** a guarantee that success will ever befall you.

It’s plainly obvious that others did as well based on the comments and votes. If anything insisting that this can’t help *anyone* just illustrates the rigid, all or nothing kind of thinking that characterizes what I would call the FA mindset. \n\nI have 100% at times in my life believed that I was doomed, hopeless, that my situation would remain unchanged “forever” but I’ve also had moments where I saw things differently. When I’m in the FA mindset I’m inconsolable and in despair. I see that in a lot of the posts here. There’s even phrases that recur and themes in people’s posts. \n\nBut there’s also a lot of variety and that gets obscured. Like there’s people here who describe total isolation and then others who have had romantic experiences that were either limited or unsatisfying in some way or are just in the past and they’re presently single. \n\nThat all those people with their varied experiences find themselves on this sub tells me that there’s no one FA experience so of course a post like yours can be helpful to some people and it’s okay if it’s not helpful to every single person. We’re all up against different challenges and facing different limitations. \n\nI hope your relationship lasts indefinitely but if it doesn’t I hope you’re able to hold on to everything you’ve learned to keep moving forward and taking care of yourself because that’s really important and necessary.

But then it hit me: I am a foreigner, literally i can screw up here and the embarrassment will only last until i go back to my country.\n\nI approached her with the best manners I got, using the broken language i managed to speak. She waa so cute, so funny, we had dinner together there as we talked more about different topics.\n\nThen, i told her i had to go back to my hotel, and she said that she wanted to spend more time with me. We went to my hotel and oh boy, we did everything we wanted.\n\nI have to admit, i sucked as a first timer. I told her I was a virgin so she was \"gentile\" with me, very soft, very good. I can't said i was good at it but she seemed to be having a good time. \n\nAfter all that, she left. I got her number but oh boy i am so excited about having lost my virginity. I feel so lucky.

Provided you're going to be alive it makes sense to make an effort to get rid of all the sources of useless pain. I don't think it's necessarily an easy process though. While it's difficult to concisely explain, what helped me was realizing that all the bitterness and negativity was a sort of narrative that I'd come to identify with. Essentially I'd become immersed in the story of being a failure, and of being ***wronged***. When I stopped attaching my sense of identity to the sequence of experiences and narratives that I'd built up throughout life then said life became significantly less painful.\n\nThat said, I also believe the 'just find new things to want bro' take is bad advice. People don't choose what they want, they simply want something or they don't. It's possible to reduce the intensity of a desire, but willfully changing it to something else isn't really how people work. I've found it to be more useful to attempt changing how seriously I take myself, my desires, and what I'd believed that I'd ought to achieve. The real problem with this is that it's not a path conducive to generating much motivation to participate in this society, so I don't think there are any perfect answers.",

It's not fulfilling mutual \"being liked/loved for who you are\" criteria, you will be dumped the moment better prospects show up.\n\nAs for societal perks, the whole irony is that one has the audacity to expect things that the collective enjoys in a society that's morally corrupted with individualism. Everyone wants things, nobody wants to be morally responsible to limit their own self to a single thing. (If I get dumped, I'll get another cause everyone is switching their relationships)\n\nIt's like \"I want to enjoy this since everyone around me is enjoying\". Then turn bitter the moment you realise that there's no hope to get into the pattern of enjoying things.\n\nAs for ignore and pretend nobody is asking you to do that. The whole argument was to do things howsoever silly instead of being bitter and wasting your own time.",

I haven't had any romantic interests in me whatsoever.\n\nDetachment isn't just a phase that runs for 4-6 months, it's literal ideology. It stems from the fact that desire causes suffering. If you are being fed with the idea that you should desire a partner, for the sake of a feeling/emotion, then I am afraid you will feel suffering.\n\nYou are allowed to feel bitter, anger, sorrow, jealousy, envy whatever the spectrum of emotions is. \nThe question arises, how long are you as yourself would be willing to stay in the hole? Gnawing at your own heart for not being desired? Nobody is asking you to \"just delude yourself bro, you don't need anything\". I am only challenging you if you can think beyond your 4 walls of bitterness or whatever makes you lose marbles. \n\nAs for quality of life, pray tell me what use is medical science if all it does is makes you live upto 80 years.  Every 10 years of life starting at 40s you start to get aching joints, terrible back, cardiac problems and partial blindness.\n\nDo you think committing murder or arson would help  relieve you from the current system? Do you believe harming the people or family that dunks on you for not having a significant other are worth keeping around in your life? Do you think you can force anyone to stay with you if you pay them every month just to stay with you cause you get bitter when you are alone?\n\nAs for easing this suffering, I am afraid I don't have a proper answer. It takes months or all the way upto a year before you start getting numb to all that darkness or your prefrontal cortex develops, whatever comes first.",

I’m 22, attending school, working part-time as a gardener, and living in a shared apartment with two of my best friends and their girlfriends, who have also become close friends since I moved in.\n\nHowever, the fact that I’ve never had a girlfriend started to bother me deeply a few months ago. When I tried dating, I realized it was much harder to find a girlfriend than I had imagined. This realization pushed me into a bit of a dark place. There were weeks where all I could think about was how \"lonely\" I felt—lonely in the romantic and physical sense, at least.\n\nI decided I needed a change. I could either continue feeling miserable or find a way to be okay with being alone. I chose the latter.\n\nI began focusing on the idea of being happy without a girlfriend. During meditation, I would tell myself, \"I can be happy without a girlfriend,\" and I tried to truly embrace what that would feel like. I made this my focus. Whenever I saw a couple, noticed an attractive woman, or interacted with women, I reminded myself of this new mindset.\n\nOver the course of several months, something shifted. There wasn’t a single moment where I felt like I had finally internalized it—it was more of a gradual change. But I did notice a difference. I was able to think about other things, and recently, when I was at a bar, I spent time enjoying the company of a friend instead of focusing on trying to talk to women I wasn’t even interested in.\n\nTo be clear, the desire for a relationship isn’t completely gone—it’s still a natural part of the human experience to want connection. But it’s no longer as overwhelming and consuming as it once was.\n\nMy mom and female friends seem to think this is a bit sad, but my male friends understand it better.\n\nSo this is how I made peace with the idea of being, and possibly staying, alone\n\nThanks for listening to my TED talk.",

At this point, Im really shifting into moving into the direction of being angry at them rather than accepting my own situation and just realizing that im just a 1 in 1000000 guy who is not cut out for having a gf. It sucks to be given one life and to loose that badly at it but it is what I have to deal with.",

When they announced their plans back in may, I was somewhat anxious as I worried by depression reappears for obvious reasons (if you're smaller sibling gets married while you didn't manage to get a hug from a girl, you'll be worried about it too). \n\nThe ceremony and subsequent party went really well, and I enjoyed it, and luckily I didn't feel lonely, I wasn't bothered by relatives/family friends about \"when will I marry?\". So all in all it was a success in my book.\n\nWe also had a family holiday after the wedding, wich also went well. The only thing I that happened was a slight melancholic feeling after I arrived home. I spent more than a week with my family (or just over a week tbh) wich is rare enough and the sudden silence of apartment made me feel lonely. \n\nBut all in all, I still count this as a success, had the wedding happened last year I would've spent the party sobbing in the corner somewhere...so I can safely say, that my \"overhauling myself\" project is has positive results on the mental health front as well (for clarification: at the beginning of the year, I decided to get myself into shape both physically, mentally and socially; so far that resulted in me losing 15 kg-s, becoming less impulsive and less anxious and spending more time \"touching grass\")  ",

I thought about it for a moment and then said yes.\n\nThe next morning, the three of us had breakfast and then we spontaneously spent the Saturday in the city together.\n\nI am not looking for a relationship with either of them, but it is a nice feeling they seem to perceive me as friendly and trustworthy.

                "score": 19,
                "text_body": "I recently discovered on my own what I now know was something I heard about in a book long ago (DBT workbook, radical acceptance + mindfulness)\n\nI had this realization that there were certain milestones in my life I haven't hit yet, and I had been beating myself up every single day about it. \"You're going to be 28 years old soon and you still haven't \\_\\_\\_\\_ yet.\" \"It's been one month since school let out and you haven't done anything productive.\" One evening, I was listening to an audiobook on meditation and mindfulness and I realized that recurring thought, \"You're this years old and still haven't done this yet\" that happens almost DAILY --- **does not help at all**. I mindlessly think, \"**If I keep shaming myself and panicking and worrying about this thing, it'll motivated me to do it.**\" It's as self defeating as if I were overweight and thinking everyday, \"I'm still fat.\" Or if I was on drugs and thinking, \"damn, I'm so ashamed I'm still on drugs.\" It's this feeling of shame and resistance that doesn't motivate me at all despite the illusion that it does. Kicking a broken mule doesn't make him move any faster.\n\nFollowing that, I had this realization **that this is the source of all insecurity.** **Wishing things were different than the way they were**. Yes I'm turning a certain age, and still haven't done a certain thing, meaning \"I wish I was this age and have already done it.\" \n\nI let that spread to all areas of my life now, this sense of acceptance. It gave me a sense of confidence and control and flow. By deluding myself that \"this is the way things are meant to be\" and \"I want it this way\" it made my brain feel unity and confidence. I realized this was exactly the problem with my loneliness too. Constantly thinking:\n\n \"damn I only have 5 friends\" (I wish I had more)\n\n \"damn my friends ignore me all the time\" (I wish they'd talk to me more instead of prioritizing their SO's) \n\n\"damn my friend who is my age is already married\" (I wish I was already married)\n\n\"my friend is in a relationship and I'm not\" (I wish I even had options)\n\nI realize the only bad thing about being FA is not accepting it. I had many nights where I think, \"If I weren't born so ugly, If I had loving parents, If I was a different race, If that bullying or trauma didn't happen... I probably wouldn't be so alone right now.\" **I realize all the agony, stress, resistance and depression - is literally resistance to the way things are**. Even perfectionism has its roots in wishing things were a different way than they are. I'll eek out a piece of work, and think, \"damn I could've done that better.\" Or, \"I should be happy all the time.\" All of these things are wishing things are a different way than they are. **And to constantly feel like you're wrong, to doubt yourself, to feel like things don't go the way you predicted or the way they \"should\" be, is how you become insecure, which leads to prioritizing other people's opinions.** Constantly telling my mind, my predictions are wrong, and gaslighting MYSELF that the way things happened aren't the way they should've happened. ***No wonder my mind can't trust itself!***\n\nSo I began to catch myself every time I had the thought, in any way shape or form of, I wish things weren't the way they are. Even small things like, I wish I weren't so tired right now - I would reply \"Accept it.\" I wish I didn't sleep so late. Accept it. I wish I didn't watch so many reels. Accept it. I wish I had more time for my walk. Accept it. Every little thing that happened in my day, I repeated to myself, \"accept it.\" (In the audiobook I was listening to, \"The Last Best Cure\", her phrase was \"forgiven.\") And that's what forgiveness is too. It's smoothing over that resistance of the past. I wish that my mom had loved me. I forgive her / Accept it. I wish I hadn't dropped out and been on drugs. Accept it. I wish I didn't grow up poor. Accept it. Even stuff like, \"I wish I wasn't born to this family.\" Accept it. Because holding onto these grudges is just causing current day resistance. I want to live a resistance free life. \n\nYou know how they talk about how \"normal\" people don't overthink or self improve, they just go with the flow and everything happens naturally for them? I think traumatic or difficult childhood things didn't happen to these people and these events make someone like us deeply question ourselves. It's the root of our insecurity. \"Wait? I can be wrong? If I'm wrong about this? What else can I be wrong about?\" or \"Since my parents always said I'm wrong and bad, then my desires shouldn't be reached.\" And the more self help books you read, the more it reinforces you just need one more book, one more secret. I think the only thing wrong with any of us here is we believe there's something wrong with us. So when we accept it, there is nothing bad about it. \n\n\"What if people still judge me for being single? I can accept myself for being single, but it's so terrible to be in a world where people are prejudiced and rude to single people.\" I realized, I can accept this too. If people want to be hateful and judgmental towards me, I accept that too with compassion and understanding. I don't need their validation for me to feel okay. If that's how the world is, I accept it. I feel in control because I choose to accept it. Perfectionism is the illusion that you'll be happy when you're in control. To force things to go your way, instead of the way they are. Actually, the best way to have control over things, is to accept and allow things the way they are. From that point, you can be flexible and improve.\n\nAccepting it doesn't mean things will stay the way they are or that we shouldn't seek to express ourselves. On the contrary, I realized for everything I \"fought\" and resisted, everything I stubbornly tried to change or deny - it would stay the same - and I would be ashamed and hide myself. While, every desire that did not have resistance, where I just believed and trusted and loved myself from where I was, change was smooth, inevitable, and successful. Then you gain self esteem, and it's easier to stand up for yourself. So I began being vicious about everything I had \"resistant\" thoughts about. The conclusion of this experiment (which has thus far only been two days) has been a wild success. I did many of the errands I meant to do, my chest pains and migraines improved, and many healthy habits have returned by simply accepting my previously wretched state. Some would call it self-love. Actually by using this accepting state in my interactions with people, I set up some social things with success too. Perhaps they can sense that since I am allowing of things to be the way they are, they feel free to be themselves. I heard that the only way to control people is to let them be themselves. (Zen mind beginner's mind) Wanting someone to act a different way is a form of resistance too, and they can sense it as a lack of love. \n\nAnd actually the \"acute pain\" of being FA has largely lifted. I realized the biggest pain came from not accepting it. The pain comes from the contradictory desire of \"I wish I had friends\" and \"I am doomed to be alone.\" Accept that you are alone, or fully put faith that you will get your desires, but to straddle the middle is where the pain is. \n\nIf I am meant to be single, then so be it. The only painful part is not accepting it, wishing that I was already in a partnership, wishing that I was already married, wishing I had a close friend etc etc. Wanting things to be any different than the way they are is the pain. Some spiritual books will help you accept things by saying \"everything you have right now is what you wished for (via your focus, law of attraction, etc)\" They all try to help you feel better by realzing the source of pain is resistance. That's what Buddha discovered a million years ago. He called it attachment. Attaching to thoughts, like the way things should be. The reason people hate being poor is because they want to be rich. That feeling of wanting things to be different. The rich? They don't even care. We want that feeling of not even caring. So to be rich right now, is to not even care. Someone will always be richer than you anyway, even when you're rich. Just like how people who have always grown up in love can take it for granted, and easily attract new partners. When we don't care, we become abundant. We get the privilege they do, even if spitefully, by saying, I don't care. The privilege of not feeling inferior, insecure, and worrying, wondering what people think. Just accept it. \n\n Sorry this post was long. I feel like there was a lot of nuance to the thought of \"accept it\" that doesn't mean to condemn or to wish things to stay the same. Actually, I even began to feel pride and enjoy being this way. I leaned into my loneliness and enjoyed it, and thought, \"wow, how wonderful it is that I can feel so deeply. What a sensitive soul I have to experience it all. What a unique and special experience. I must have chosen to be born this way.\" I began to visualize myself as an icon, that I could produce art to share the experience - of all the trauma and events that makes one feel so wrong and ostracized so that others would not feel lonely.  instead of feeling shame I felt pride. I heard somewhere that people who feel misunderstood create art, and instead of their world being rejected by people, people actually pay to experience their world because it is so unique. And when I leaned into it and accepted it, the pain lifted, and my life felt marvelous.  ",

You can only pretend this lie as long as you don't get confronted by reality, how people constantly treat and disappoint you.\n\nI hope your discovery lasts, but as you said that you only discovered it recently I have my doubts.",

I want to convey I say the next parts with utmost compassion and love because I've been there. Sorry that it is long... I suck at condensing.\n\nI used to believe that confidence comes from external validation. \"Of course they can be happy, when everyone has always approved of and supported them.\" But, relying on externals is tenous. \n\nI used to think \"If I had been listened to and supported by others, I'd be confident now too.\" And I waited... and I waited... and nobody ever came to validate me. On the contrary, I faced more rejection, criticism and loss. (**EYIOP**\\*)\n\nAnd I realized, \"wow, back when I chase externals, the status, the grades, the looks, the career, I was more insecure than ever. Because when I lost it all, when my day went poorly, when I had a fight, when I had a poor grade, I would become moody and emotional. When my friends praised me, when my project was noticed, I would feel ecstatic.\" Actually, relying on these externals made me *less* confident and more erratic. \n\nIn the darkness and absence of any praise or validation, I grew to learn true, authentic, intrinsic motivation. I realized even when people rejected me, even when I failed, I still had a desire to continue to do the things I wanted - and I realized what a marvelous gift that was. Other people could \\*only succeed\\* when they had approval and when things were going well. But I could succeed 100% of the time, whether I was praised or whether I was ignored and condemned. And I changed the mindset that being right didn't mean that other people agreed with you, being right meant listening to your own gut.\n\nBeing rejected had taught me to be happy and confident on my own terms, something people who have only lived on external validation never get to experience. I've seen people cling onto bad situations because they are terrified of what it would mean to \"lose it all\". Because I never had it to begin with, I have more confidence than ever. I actually feel blessed that I had lost it all/never had it, and saw that I could survive it, so anything else that comes my way is only an addition to life. \n\nSo, tl;dr, the belief that happiness and confidence comes from external validation is holding you back. \n\nWhen I let go of that, I saw myself succeed and flourish in all areas of life, and to enjoy life and be more productive than I have ever been. It was actually a crutch to have that praise and even worse to chase it. See your invisibility as a blessing. It is the universe teaching you to learn to listen to yourself. \n\nElaborating on **EIYOP**:  \nThe manifesting community saved me from the pain of FA. \"Everyone Is You Pushed Out\" When you feel that you are wrong and bad, other people reflect that. Your internal beliefs affect how you act in the world, and people respond to that.",

Your internal beliefs affect how you act in the world, and people respond to that. \n\nSure, people who were treated well as kids have the internal belief that \"I am good. I am enough. Other people are good and love me.\" So they come out into the world smiling and happy, and people reflect that kindness and trustworthiness. \n\nEIYOP is not blaming you for being treated badly by people, it is empowering you to see you have control over the situation. People treat you how you treat yourself. \n\n**An example of when I chased external validation:**\n\nFor instance, when I used to show people my art with the attitude of \"I hope people like it\" I was ignored, zero praise - possibly even mocked! When I showed up with my art with the attitude that \"this is the best thing that was ever created\" it became monumental and overwhelmingly praised. \n\nThere was a period in my life where I struggled to make any art, and I desperately wished that \"if only someone had praised me, I would be so motivated\" I received only more ignoring and condemnation. That was the period where I learned this, being ignored, was a blessing. If nobody cared, then I could do whatever I wanted! I accepted it, and my motivation and enthusiasm came roaring back - without any need of waiting for someone to approve of me first. Instead of seeing my style as strange and flawed, I saw it as unique and charming - and people reflected that. \n\n**Lipstick on a Pig**\n\nWhen I was in high-school, I tried desperately to be pretty. I would lose weight, style my hair, put makeup on, dress up - and this was all with the aura of \"I'm really ugly, I'm really deficient, please, please validate me and prove that I'm wrong.\" And you can imagine, even as well dressed, young, and skinny that I was, the boys ignored and rejected me. Everyone proved that I was ugly. People treated me like I was ugly. **It was this \"seeking external validation\" that made me ugly.** I used to think no matter what I tried, it was like putting lipstick on a pig.\n\nOver a decade later, I could have bed hair, no makeup, a shirt and slippers and I would have men flirting with me and strangers treating me well, smiling, and making small talk with me, holding doors open for me. \n\nWhat happened? Full disclosure, I did get plastic surgery. It made me believe \"I am beautiful now.\" (But, the change was so subtle that people who knew me are surprised that I had plastic surgery) I first even had to believe I deserved to be beautiful to go under the knife. \n\nBut this internal shift of believing I am beautiful now was reflected in the external. I now believed I deserved to dress and act however I want, because \"I am beautiful now.\" **I didn't have to try so hard, or to cover up deficiencies.** I wore makeup the way I liked it, even if it was weird or outlandish. This feeling of being comfortable in my skin made me beautiful. But that - I changed - before other people approved of me.\n\n**It is chasing validation that makes you ugly and unwanted.** The lack of validation may be the catalyst for learning intrinsic validation if you did not get it in childhood. In fact, the story that \"other people are confident because their parents loved them\" is just a story.  I'm confident \\*because\\* my parents neglected and abused me, so I had to learn on my own. I revised my own story too, bc of the manifesting stuff. I said, my parents didn't neglect me - they treated me like an adult because they trusted I was smart and capable. That is why I am clever and mature. \n\nWomen want to be with a winner. Decide that you are already a winner. You don't need them to prove you are a winner. They accept you as you are. If you come to them, asking for their approval, they reflect back that insecurity. I am pretty and beautiful regardless of if I am taken. I used to think that too! If I don't have a boyfriend, I must be really ugly. But I decided, no, the external doesn't matter. You can be happy and confident regardless of the external. And after all, you get everything you desire when you are happy first. I highly recommend checking out Neville Goddard and other manifesting stuff.",

However, my girlfriend wanted us to get there 2 hours before the party started so we could have time to ourselves. My girlfriend and i haven't been able to do many in-person dates due to scheduling conflicts but we have been making it up through \"Phone Dates\" where we just call each other and get lost in the time, sometimes an hour or even 2.\n\nBut yeah, we held hands around the arcade and played games together and then just hung out talking to each other at a table.\n\nThroughout the date, she kept taking pictures of us together. After one picture, she didn't let go of the hug. I told her let's just stay like this for awhile. She was hugging me with her head on my chest and i just kept stroking her hair. I told her i was really happy during the hug and she went \"Aw\". It went on for awhile.\n\nWhen i offered to buy her dinner, she seemed really happy about it and started to hug me. When i paid for her bowling shoes, she looked like she was about to cry and hugged me again.\n\nI also caught her keep looking at me and smiling when we were watching people bowl. But would quickly look away if i looked over at her. She also gave me a bracelet, she said she felt like she had to give me something in return (In return for the dinner/shoes or the flower i bought her previously. I'm not sure). I also told her i'm new to dating and she seemed really understanding.\n\nShe really laughed at and enjoyed my jokes. We met up for a friend's birthday after our date, then we went home. I remember in the car ride, i told her the gang is really starting to like her (We met thruough a hobby group) and then i whispered \"Not as much as i like her thought\" and she started giggling, for a minute straight. And then that was it, i dropped her off at home, we hugged in her driveway. Then she's texting me about how great a time she had and we should do this again.\n\nIt was a magical night. If you told me a year ago that i'd have a girl like her, i'd never have believed you. But i met the perfect girl, she's sweet, she's understanding, she reaally likes me and she's genuinely just super cute. She's amazing, just incredible. A little shy, but she does really seem to like me.",

                "text_body": "We're officially boyfriend and girlfriend now. Last night was pure bliss, magic. A lot of the doom and gloom i was talking about was honestly my own insecurities coming out. Last night my patience paid off and i regret ever thinking it wasn't meant to be.\n\nLast night, we met up through our hobby group. First time we'd seen each other in about a month. The seat by her is conspiculously open even though i arrived late (My friends have been very proactive in getting us together, so either they intentionally left it open or she reserved it for me herself cause every other seat was taken). After the game and everything ended, i asked her to take a picture with me and she happily obliges, she puts her arm around me and got super close right away. I put my arm around her and we got really close together, like our cheeks were touching cause we were so close. She introduces me to her mom when she comes to pick her up and she invites me to join her family for dinner. I gave her a flower i brought prior to the meeting as a surprise and she jumped into my arms with a hug and we just held each other for quite awhile. A big tight hug. Then the next morning, she's texting me and calls me sweetie during the text. So that's it, we're official.\n\nSo i guess this is my goodbye for r/foreveralone. I want to thank everyone for the support and listening to me vent and all over the past 3 years, it took 26 years but i got a girlfriend. It's honestly been an amazing experience and i've never been this happy. I guess my advice to you all is be patient. I never thought it'd happen, but now at 26 i have a woman who's actually really into me and no joke is genuinely super adorable. Way more attractive then me.\n\nMy 3 biggest pieces of advice as someone who broke out of this cycle: 1) Hobby groups are absolutely NOT a waste of time. Try to find one, go to libraries, rec centers, maybe even see if card and toy shops have some sort of events. Plus give it time, i'd been in the group for about 5 months before i made any friends and about 10 months before i met her.\n\n2) Don't overthink things, if you think someone might be into you, just ask. A lot of people second guess whether someone's interested or not. In my opinion, it's better to just try and ask rather then worry over the \"Is she into me or just being nice?\" thought. It's not going to ruin the friendship. When i made my first post about her, many of the comments suggested she was just being nice and there was no interest. But i went with my gut and tried to ask anyway.\n\n3) Ask them about themselves. Their interests, hobbies, passions, etc.. That's what i did with her. I was just a listener for her\n\n(Obviously none of this is guaranteed to help, i admit i might have just been lucky. But this is just my perspective and what worked for me.)",

So what I did is get a beer from the bar and started awkwardly dancing while watching my friend on-stage.\n\nOver the course of the night, I met a cool dude and was approached by and danced with two absolutely beautiful women. Here I am, shortest guy in the room, dressed casually, awkwardly “dancing” and not one, but two beautiful women came up to me, introduced themselves, and danced with me.\n\nI cannot even describe how psychologically impactful that was.

She has a BF and was kind of a bed hopper before that so i didn't want anything to do with her before in fear she would just break my heart. \n\nSince then we had lay offs and before that i had a drink with her when i said to her that she means more to me than my former male friend group who i feel like don't care about me and just use me when convenient.\n\nShe was even there as emotional support when my father died. So i told her i absolutely want to stay friends when we go to seperate jobs.\n\nLast weekend she invited me to a party to celebrate some achievment of hers. Only me, her boyfriend and 2 female friends of hers were coming. \n\nI got her a gift bag and she was happy i was so thoughtful how personal the items were.\n\nAll went well at the event and she included me in the talks, my anxiety was manageable. I didn't feel uncomfortable like when i went to birthday parties for my former guy friends and was 'left to my own devices' and they didn't talk to me the whole evening.\n\nAfter i came home i wasn't feeling depressed like i usually do when i come from social events. Often i feel more alone afterwards than before, knowing i didn't fit in. Not here.\n\nIt really is about the people i meet, not my supposedly terrible attitude like some redditors like to say. A big amount of luck involved i guess.\n\nSo yeah i am really happy about this and just wanted to share.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It was tough but it was worth the wait. \n\nI have only one advice. You don't have to do much except talk to girls. Try to make friends with them. Without any intention of getting anything in return. One of the girl friend made me a dating profile which had only 1 photo of mine. She told me looks don't matter to the girl you want. And if it matters to the girl she isn't who you want. \n\nSo keep patience and go out there and make friends. I am happy to answer any questions you want. Now I have another battle to fight.

She a pretty, confident, outgoing, social drinker who's most likely relatively experienced with guys trying to get with her. So I'm going to continue on with my point, and I invite you to speak your mind about it. \n\n\n> They will think you are not interested.\n\nThis can make you more attractive. The psychological effect of wanting what you can't have. When every guy she meets wants to fuck her, it gets old pretty quick.  When it becomes predictable and repetitive it just doesn't hit the same when you're asked out for the 50th time, especially when you drunkenly made out with a dude you just met that day. \n\nIf instead of you asking her out because she's hot, she may be more receptive if you ask her out because you have an experience together, and there's something she's done that made her attractive to you besides her simply being present. You will have more success playing it cool with this type of girl who probably isn't looking for a relationship anyways if she's making out with dudes day one of meeting them at a club.",

Recently I have come to two conclusions, one is that dating is borderline impossible for me, but the second is that I actually don’t want to date.\n\nSee I think I was approaching it from the wrong angle. I have had this pervasive socially constructed idea that I need a relationship because that’s what people need and that some sort of Disney-esque love is the ideal. But I don’t think that type of love really exists but also I don’t think I actually want a relationship personally. I don’t like intimacy, I don’t trust others, and I value being self-sufficient more than anything. A relationship requires the exact opposite of those core character traits, and really has lost its appeal to me.\n\nOnce I realized that the main reasons I was so distraught about being alone were socially conditioned and not a result of my actual core feelings it clicked for me and the sadness/desperation completely disappeared. I’ll be FA yes, but that’s fine with me because I only really need myself and my friends. My whole mindset has shifted, for example now when I hear my friends talk about Tinder or whatever I don’t feel jealous I just think “damn, glad I don’t have to deal with that” lol.\n\nSo yea, still forever alone but at peace with it in a way I never thought possible.

When she read it, i told her i consider her part of our circle\n\nShe seemed surprised i got her one. And flattered. She looked at it and smiled for a moment without saying anything. i asked if she wanted a hug, she gave me one. Not a side or awkward hug, but a real full contact one. A long one too. A few seconds. \n\nShe's someone i've always gelled with in our circle.\n\nSo i have to ask, is it a sign of interest or am i thinking wishfully? i admit i could be.

We're moving in together next month.  So I guess I got the dream.  I was debating on if I should make a success/follow up post, but eh...if it triggers some people, hopefully they can see the flair and skip.\n\nAnyways, it was a total luck thing.  I got lucky that I happen to see her postings on a local discord, lucky enough that we talked on Discord and clicked and lived close to each other.  Wish I could say it was due to working on myself, or self improvement etc, but it was mostly luck.  \n\nThe one thing I am so happy about- when I first saw her posting on Discord, I debated messaging her or not.  I'm not some creep that spam messages every girl with a copy paste intro, I pretty much never DM people unless for gaming.  But I'm so glad that I shot my shot.  \n\nThe other thing I wanted to point out was-  I used to consume a ton of porn, and it had negative affects on my brain (and in the bedroom)S.  It was surprisingly hard to quit.  I guess its hard to know if you're addicted if you never tried to quit before.  I was more addicted than I realized.  Took me several months to solve my issues.  \n\nAnyways, thank for you listening to my TED Talk.",

I still have a lot to learn, but I wanted to share what worked for me. \n\nI will probably get downvoted to oblivion, but I wanted to point out that I largely give credit to the extended periods of Nofap (NF) for my success and escaping FA. I don't see it talked about here a lot.\n\nFor context, I have been masturbating once daily since I was about in 7th grade. I had heard about NF in high school and I thought it was some trend or joke. Fast forward to this year and one of my best friends suggested it for my FA situation. I gave it a try and haven't looked back since.\n\nNow, what do I mean by extended periods of NF ? 100+ days of no porn, masturbation, etc. \n\nThere's a lot of benefits that I observed. I used to not believe in nofap at all, but I firmly believe there's some truth to it. If anything, call it placebo.\n\nHere's what I've observed:\n\n* Easier to hold eye contact with not just women, but people in general.\n   * I feel this is key when it comes to flirting or showing romantic interest.\n* Less social anxiety.\n   * This speaks for itself. As someone who was diagnosed with anxiety NF has worked wonders.\n* Improved confidence.\n   * Same as above. I felt more confident to approach women.\n* Easier to hold conversations with people.\n   * I just feel I can have conversations more naturally and just about any topic. I've been complimented on this a number of times by women that I'm just easier to talk to.\n* Not as fixated on porn/sex I suppose? I was able to look at women more as people.\n   * As a matter of fact, I was able to form my first genuine friendships with women. \n* Improved energy.\n   * Having been diagnosed with depression as well, I felt I had more energy throughout the day. I still rely on caffeine of course!\n* Hair and skin.\n   * This one I am not 100% certain of. I felt my facial hair and hair grow much faster. I also observed my skin clearing up.\n\nOf course, there were some downsides.\n\n* An extremely high libido.\n   * I was able to remedy this somewhat by preoccupying myself with hobbies or working out.\n* Mood swings.\n   * This one was weird. At times my mood would drastically shift. I'm not on any medications so I attribute this to NF. I might be wrong.\n* Wet dreams.\n   * Gross, I know. These came back.\n\nIs this the key to escaping FA? Absolutely not. I believe there were other factors such as luck and circumstance that allowed me to escape FA but I believe NF genuinely helped me.

I didn't really know her, I would say hi here and there.\n\nJust last May she received a promotion and I found more opportunities to chat with her at work. We were very much cordial, and would get lunch together once in a while. She mentioned that she was talking to a guy so I figured that was my cue to back off, and I did. Sure enough she is no longer with that guy as of last month and I notice she's flirting with me in subtle ways (eye contact, finding reasons to see me, etc.). On a whim I asked for her number and we would text here and there outside of work, sending an occasional work meme. 2 weeks ago I got the courage to ask her on a date and she said yes.\n\nWe went on said date at a barcade, and had drinks. At this point she's giving me all kinds of signals that she's into me (touching me, being playful with banter, etc.). All of this is happening rather quickly but because of my prior experience going out with friends I knew how to navigate bars and alcohol (in retrospect, if I didn't have this experience I would have not gotten anywhere that night). My priority on this date was to keep our chemistry that we established at work and escalate: I made sure she was laughing and having a good time. We did some goofy couple shit (holding hands, running in the rain, taking photos in a Photo Booth) that I thought would set the mood, so to speak. We go to a few more bars and were both pretty buzzed, but coherent enough. I didn't want neither her or myself to blackout for obvious reasons.\n\nShe offers to uber back to her place and I agree. She literally guides me to her room and takes off her clothes and explicitly says \"I want you to fuck me\" and I'm going off what I've seen in porn to begin foreplay and I finally do the deed. She reveals she had a thing for me since we first met and was happy to finally get to know me.\n\nThat's basically it, I suppose. I've hooked up with her once more since then. Been on a few dates with her since.",

In my experience, when I felt forever alone, I needed some more emotional independance and maturing, which a relationship certainly entails. I often struggled dating because I got involved emotionally. So I think focusing on finding a date, meeting some and get some attraction going and getting to know them is a better goal. Certainly, if things go well, you can transition that into a relationship. But nowadays it's so hard to find someone who's worth a relationship, especially for men. So I don't have a lot of expectations when it comes to finding gilfriend material in the dating scene.",

Last March we were married. \n\nIt’s not always so simple, but remember that I didn’t join to meet the love of my life (and certainly not to marry one) and it really made me comfortable enough to give him my cell. He was the only one I gave it to.\n\nWhether or not you end up finding the person of your dreams you will learn more about most types of men. My husband is totally in agreement. He was on match because he couldn’t exactly hang around Fraternity Row. He has two PHDs and a law degree but is simply a teacher for underprivileged kids. He got the law degree to be able to process his own words and apply for grants. He also works as an archaeologist.\n\nSorry for rambling, just wanted to give you a way to reassume your perspective.",

When you see an egg you want to crack it, a turtle not so much. Present yourself in a way that makes people want to crack that egg shell.\n\nIf you're a male, include photos of yourself with attractive women who you are clearly friends with, but don't make it your profile picture. I know some people on here will criticize me for this one, but for whatever reason I've been friends with some truly stunning women through my life, which leads me to my next point. This does not apply if you're a girl though, do not include pictures of dudes in your picture ever. \n\nDon't be bitter. This wasn't a suggestion, but just a topic of conversation.  For myself, I gave up on finding a GF fairly early on, but I decided to not be bitter towards women about it. Because of that I was able to make good female friends, like I said before be an egg. You will naturally learn how to not come off as a creep and not give girls the \"ick\".\n\nThis is from her directly, maybe hire an escort to test out my personality in a sexual situation and how to incorporate that in escalating with a regular girl.\n\nFinally, accept that you won't appeal to every girl. According to her on my OLD my pictures were terrible, but my prompts and bio were legitimately smart and funny. But at the same time, it was smart, meaning a dumb person wouldn't get the joke. I'll never appeal to a dumb girl, but I would with a smart one.",

How can one possibly compete against literally **thousands** of other people online? Even worse, there are people online who are already in relationships and want a bit extra on the side!\n\nWith my only option being online dating and that's too difficult, how can I possibly find a boyfriend?

                        "comment": "Not to be cynical but tbh the \"go to meet ups and events\" is still a crap shoot advice, at least it is for me. I've personally been to meet ups, not just forcing my self to go type of thing. It was for a meet up somebody set up on fb and the actual reasoning was something I was actually passionate about. I genuinely thought it went well, with exchanging numbers and on the drive back home I thought for the first time in a long time I was making new friends. Guess how many of those people I'm still in touch with?......NONE OF THEM...It works for some, for some it doesn't. Lately it feels like I've just been staying in like a recluse but it's because I've been there done that and already know the outcome. The best case is always only just good conversation MAYBE, if you pass the eye test on if they think you're freak or not but it never leads to anything more then that. People say go to more event groups on a regular basis (as if events happen that frequently to begin with), but then that proves how even more pointless it is because than that's basically having to vet new people all over again which is not just fun and games, it's work.  \n\n\nIt takes a lot of mental energy to get to know someone new and instead of maintaining with the same people which is what you're supposed to, continuously starting over and talking to new people every time which is what normies suggest is like playing a video game and always starting at level 1 and your progress never being saved. Don't get me wrong, you're brave and strong for doing what you did, but I hope you don't get your hopes up too high because unless you have some sigma like personality and or good looks, I'm afraid the same is going to happen. I'm almost curious to see how this turns out and would like to see an update a couple weeks from now to see if you maintained any contact with any of the new people you've yet. To me, meet ups are pointless if you're passed the age of 25.  \n\n\nBy that point all the people in your age range have found their own clique of friends they will have for pretty much the rest of their time here and while not impossible most people by then will be reluctant to add new people to their circle. For me, I know I'm not missing out because I've already tried a handful of times and outcome is never any different. It's either awkward and everyone thinks i'm some sort of a freak or I luck out and people actually think I'm pretty chill, but in the end maintaining zero actual friendships with any of them. Now people might say, you don't need to be life long friends with them, just enjoy the convo while it lasts but that's not something I'm willing to do anymore. If a real connection isn't made, then it's just meaningless npc conversations happening for the sake of entertaining others.  \n\n\nI'm sorry but I'm looking for real friends, not to be anyone's jester and it always feels like I'm trying to impress people or trying so hard to make sure they don't think I'm some weird loser. Just some small talk conversations isn't worth the mental tax. The roi (return in investment) isn't worth it anymore. I'm not saying it's pointless for everyone, hell it may just work out for you but for me at the tender age of 29, being almost 30 (as I'm currently typing this), it's too late for me. Basically when I used to try and meet new people from this meet ups, I mistook acquaintances as friendships, which obviously isn't the same thing at all. So these people you meet there will most likely be down for that, but not a long term friendship, which then to me makes the whole entire encounter pointless. It then just becomes a chore. Talking can be fun but it can also be a chore depending on the circumstance and why you're doing it. I wouldn't expect anyone to want to be my friend anyways. I bring nothing to the table and it would just suck the life force out of them trying to be my friend, not that I'm some horrible demon or boring, but with how my life is, I wouldn't want to even slightly drag anyone into my bullshit world.",

There is a classmate in our Greek class who is, iirc, 30 y.o. He’s a chill dude, quite amicable and welcoming. At first it was just my clumsy attempts at greeting him (and the rest of our class), and slowly it went to “how was your day,” or “how’s homework.”\n\nNot so long ago, one of his friends whom he was hanging out with during lunch break, inquired about his pregnant wife and the child’s future name. The conversation was lively, and in the end, he casually invited whoever wanted to go to an upcoming baby shower party; the invitation was forwarded to me also.\n\nThis was, and still is to date, a huge social success for my socially anxious and inept ass. This proved to me that at least I can make some dent in people’s minds, and that I’m not a wholly ghost or wall ought to be forgotten; that the actions and changes I’ve decided to make are heading in the, at first glance, right direction. And I’m happy about it.\n\nNow, the day arrived, and I went to the agreed-upon place and time. There I greeted the other classmates who are his friends too. There were other people, some the same age as him, with only those from our university being my age (give or take). The party had a few activities, they offered us food and drinks, and I even tried whiskey for the first time in my life. But I didn’t talk with anyone; everyone was busy with their group of friends or companions, and the guy who invited me to the party was also busy.\n\nSafe to say, I didn’t do much besides sitting in the background, greeting the people there, delivering the gift for the baby, and bidding farewell... didn't get the chance to eat cake :´)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis may not seem like much, and I have to say I felt awkward and misplaced at all times, but this little win in my almost neverending streak of failures put a meagre smile on my face.",

                "text_body": "I was a lot like you all here, the over prevailing sense of loneliness, the frustration and anomalous angst, though I was never much of an internet guy. After my mother had passed away in 2016 I found that there wasn't much left for me anywhere and feel into a deep spiral of drinking and pushing people away. After a year of doing nothing but scrapping by and waking up hungover I eventually decided to just leave. After watching an interview with a band I really like \"Sleep\" I learned that one of their guitarists who had left the band just before they got successful went to become a monk on the St. Nilus islet and I figured, \"why not.\" A few weeks later I subleased my apartment to a coworker, packed my whole apartment into three bags and hopped a train to Washington where I caught a few flights to Kodiak station. Once there I spent the day asking around about how to get there and met a Sun'aq woman who offered to lodge me until her son got back from hunting a few days later. In that time, the cold was brutal, the food was strange, and being from Texas I took it like a wimp but she was very kind and gave me a bunch of winter clothing to get me by, introduced me to some of the sweetest people I ever met. I felt more affection and connection in those few days than I thought I had in my whole life and I loved it and wanted to stay. But soon enough her son arrived home and he offered to give me a ride out to the ferry dock at the ass end of the continent. When we arrived the next day he dropped me off and headed out after a curt goodbye. I started to regret everything but I had gone to far to turn back and got on the next supply ferry to the island.   \n\n\nWhen I arrived it was as If i had stepped through a time machine aside from the few diesel generators I could hear in the distance. I waited out front for probably an hour kicking my feet before a young guy, not much older than me came out and led me in without saying much of anything. I met with a few of the elder's who asked me some basic info, my faith, any family, plans, if I was serious about this, etc. By noon they took my stuff and put them somewhere and asked me to wash in the ocean. It was beyond cold and I would have drowned after just sticking a toe in if they hadn't been holding onto me. When I returned they had a bed made and a single set of drab brown robes.   \n\n\nI spent the next fiveish years on a strict routine of morning prayer's, a light meal, more prayers, chores, a light meal, prayers, singing lessons, chores, a light meal, prayers, sleep. Though there must have been about 300 people (probably more) I can't remember many conversations about myself or the other's. It was all strictly utilitarian outside of the occasional passing \"great weather this season\". I was constantly cold, hungry, and tired, but despite all of that I realized I wasn't lonely anymore. Not that any circumstances had really changed internally, but it was reframed for me. Through it all, the religious aspect of it, though I didn't, and still don't really subscribe to much of it, created a space for me to just be inside my own head and find a sense of self irrespective of any social conventions. It \"sucked\" but I loved it. \"The cold makes your soul like iron\" the Bishop had said to me early on when I confessed to him how much I had been struggling with adjusting, \"Do you think the metal likes to be hit with a hammer?\" and that's something I have been saying to myself a lot as of late.   \n\n\nLate last year, my father had passed and my uncle had hired a PI to find me. When I got the letter I had a really hard time saying goodbye and I could tell the elder's weren't pleased with me in the least, but they brought me my things and I caught the next ferry off the island and started home to see what was left of my family. We had the funeral last October and it's now been over a year since I've been back. Got a warehouse job at Uline and finally got out of my Uncle's basement and into a crumby apartment in Chicago a few months ago.   \n\n\nIt's been so strange, I felt lonely before, but now despite having a completely different, unrelatable life experience to anyone around me I feel fine. I feel content. Admittedly, I haven't adjusted as well as I'd like, I tend to stare a lot and not say much, and was recently informed by the cute security lady that I'm \"weird, but not the scary kind, ya know?\" amid some other over heard comment's about me being autistic yada yada. \n\nThough I doubt this would be applicable to most if any of you, just get a way, don't get out of your own head like people tend to say, get in it, that's were the peace is. \n\nDespite the last 5 years of being told that the internet is the greatest evil in man's creation, I'm digging it a lot more now.",

Hopefully I touch the heart of at least 1 of you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI always thought I'd be Forever Alone. I've always been short, fat, immature, nerdy, unmanly. In High School, I always acted cringey around girls and was nowhere near having a girlfriend. In College, I just played WoW, got no attention from girls. After college, I stopped trying. I figured it's too late. Every day I would feel so upset and insecure about how no woman would ever want me. I followed all the typical advice, \"work on yourself, workout, go to therapy, get a good job.\"  Got a good paying job, lost 80lbs, moved out of my parents house, put up some good gym pics on Tinder, still absolutely nothing. No attention from women.\n\nSo I gave up, and just lost myself in videogames, weed, alcohol, and just enjoying my bachelor life. I started saying fuck it and just traveling alone, going to concerts alone, doing everything alone. Feeling lonely as shit, but it was better than moping around by myself. I ended up making a lot of friends through work, mutual friends, and random event going.\n\nAnyway, 2 years ago, one of my friends, who I considered my douchiest, most obnoxious, most annoying, most pompous, most assholest friends, ended up getting a girlfriend. I was astonished as to how, and he told me it was on Hinge.\n\nSo one night, I was drinking and said fuck it, I'll make a Hinge account and be as open minded and absolute honest as I can be, just to see what happens. I expected absolutely nothing because I wasn't gonna do the typical \"cool guy on a dating app\" that everyone does and that I've always done. I legit put on my profile that I'm not manly, that I hate gender roles, I like craft beer and football, that I love Pokemon and EDM and Hasanabi and Nintendo and Lady Gaga and Pride festivals. I put that I'm 5'3, don't want kids and have a gaming PC. The pictures that I put up were unabashedly displaying how short I am (myself next to my friends or in a chair).\n\nFor months, I got pretty much what I expected. Absolutely nothing. A hit here and there, who would stop talking after a few minutes. To put it into perspective, I made my profile March 2022, kept up with it for a few months, and stopped using it after I said to myself \"yeah, thats what I thought.\"\n\nIn January 2023, I opened up the app again after remembering it, and I saw someone had messaged me in December saying \"Please be real.\" I looked at her profile and it was a girl who was  thin, pretty, liked cosplay, going to conventions, was into card games, liked playing xbox and PC games, board games, liked EDM, was leftist/feminist, and loved scifi/fantasy.\n\nI replied to her a month later, and we never stopped talking. We have been boyfriend/girlfriend now for 10 months and I can see myself marrying this woman. She is everything I always wished for in a partner. We play games together, watch nerdy stuff together, she doesnt care about manliness, or height or money or any of the stuff I always thought I had to be to get a girlfriend. I can paint my nails and wear skirts around her, we play pokemon together, we cosplay together, we go to concerts together, we play board games and cook D&D food together. She's sexually adventurous and eager to try different things in the bedroom.\n\nIt's a dream come true, and after 35 years of thinking I was going to be Forever Alone, I finally see why people always said \"be yourself, work on yourself,\" etc. It seemed like useless information before, but now I can't imagine ever not following that advice, even if this relationship falls through.\n\nNever lose hope.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

For example, conditions like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder tend to have a stronger genetic component, with heritability estimates often exceeding 70%. In contrast, conditions like depression and anxiety disorders may have a lower but still significant heritability, often around 30-40%.\n\nEnvironmental Factors: It's important to note that environmental factors, such as life experiences, upbringing, and trauma, also significantly influence the development of mental illnesses. Genes interact with the environment, making it a complex interplay.\n\nSo... I do think genes played a role in my SA, but it's definitely possible to rewire your brain.",

                "text_body": "As you may see if you look over my previous posts, I was a \"forever alone\" guy in his late 20's who had a lot of self-esteem issues arising from that, and I don't just mean in terms of dating -- I could scarcely get any friends, let alone sustain friendships for more than like a couple of years before losing them due to my lack of social abilities. I'm a socially uncalibrated and autistic guy who has a hard time relating to others or carrying conversations with people. I was disconnected emotionally from my family at large too, so I really felt like an alien. I had kissed and held hands before in my early youth with my parents' friends' kid, and later at age 26 with someone I managed to date for two weeks, but I was a virgin who had never had a serious relationship. In addition, I had a lot of trouble starting my post-graduate career for a while, which combined with my lack of connections made it more difficult to find a job or an affordable place; so for a while I was literally living in my mom's basement as I constantly searched for work and could scarcely get anything other than meager entry-level stuff that had nothing to do with my degree. I essentially became one of the textbook examples of the guy you make fun of and don't want to turn out as -- a lonely, meagerly (if at all) employed, friendless, dateless, unconfident virgin loser in his late 20's \\*literally\\* living in his mom's basement. I hated myself a lot and thought about suicide multiple times, deeming myself stupid and worthless. It was hard for me to live with myself and not just seethe and cringe constantly at who I was and what I became. I developed a thankfully very minor case of Tourettes (i.e. facial tics) at that time, and I have a feeling that developed largely from me cringing at myself constantly.\n\nBy late 2021 I was doing a bit better after the miserable isolated rug-pull of 2020. I finally had a solid and fitting job, and was living somewhere and paying rent entirely on my own for the first time, not even having to find roommates to split rent with anymore. I also managed to find a few local social gatherings and volunteer orgs I could attend regularly, bring value to, and forge a few connections at. But funnily enough around this time, I met someone around my age on the Forever Alone Dating sub. I replied to one of her posts, we began exchanging messages, and then we felt like having a Discord voice call. It went well, so we started having more calls and exchanged pictures. We both liked each other and found each other adorable to look at and listen to, which was a relief -- I've almost never been liked back by someone who I like, and usually when I shared my picture in those kinds of things I got ghosted. This girl would much later tell me that she would share one of my pictures and voicemails with her friends to playfully boast about this cute guy she got to talk to. That's amazing. That never happened before.\n\nVoice calls turned into phone calls and even video calls. Conversations grew longer and deeper, aided by the fact that I did some advance research on good questions and conversation topics (research in general has helped me a lot through different stages with this girl, even if just to act with a plan and not seem completely clueless and inexperienced). I learned that the city I was about to move back to is one that she was also planning on moving back to. Not long after I finally moved back here where I live today, and months after we first started talking, I broached the subject of flying her out to visit. She enthusiastically agreed and (knowing this was a gamble) I bought her a plane ticket to come visit me for a week sometime late in the summer of 2022.\n\nAlready by that point I had put together a list of marked places in the city to go to for dates, and when it was set for her to come out, I spent a lot of time planning things to do, opening and closing times, routes, etc. I prepared things to be extra nice for when she got here. I was determined to get this right and finally hit it out of the park for someone, and prove to myself that I could actually be a worthy partner and that I wasn't just a terminal loser. I figured that even if this person turned out to ghost me and not show up, I should at least know what to do in the future.\n\nBut sure enough, she did fly out and we were so happy to meet each other. We hugged and held hands on the trip back to my place, and made out a bit when we got there (one of several times that week). My planning paid off and we went on all sorts of adventures together to different places. She was impressed at how well I planned stuff out and how open I was to different things. By the end of her visit, we agreed we wanted to stay together and that she should move down here. We kept in touch over the phone, and finally, in December 2022, she came down here for good. By that time I had also made a few new friends when I joined their band through an ad they posted.\n\nLater that month my new girlfriend(!) and I went with those new friends of mine on a trip to another city (one that I had been to many years before and that had a lot of personal significance to me) so the band I joined could play its first show. The next morning, in a hotel room, I lost my virginity to my new girlfriend, just a few months after my 30th birthday and (almost to the day) a year after we first met online. I didn't tell her I was a virgin or anything and I just went by prior research on good technique, combined with intuition and just listening to her. I think it went pretty well for both of us. Interestingly enough, I wasn't even that nervous. I was so happy, though. It seemed a bit surreal.\n\nSo yes, I kind of am (was?) a wizard, but not by much.\n\nA few months later she moved in with me. She's been living with me for 7 months and it's gone well. We still have long conversations and go places. We've had occasional issues and disagreements but have worked through them. My times with her have been among the best times of my life, ones that I will never forget. We love each other. We enjoy each other's company, and sex. I love doing stuff like taking her places and cooking for her, and she does nice things for me too. With time we have both become aware of each other's limiting issues and struggles (we did both meet on Forever Alone Dating, after all). Plus I'm in a solid friend group for the first time in years and we sometimes go on adventures too. I finally feel like some kind of adult. Never before at the same time have I had my own place, AND my own job, AND my own friends, AND my own girlfriend, and I got them all myself. I actually like myself for the first time in years, probably since early-to-mid junior high (the last time I could say I was happy before I totally lost confidence and kind of folded in on myself mentally). It's occurred to me that in a way I've been consistently like a decade behind in terms of life development. I feel like I'm having my 20's in my 30's, my 20's were my awkward teen years, and in my teens I was still like a little kid but with major neuroses and acne.\n\nI'm aware I don't know what the future may hold. I make it a point to soak in every moment with my girlfriend and friends because I never know how long I'll have them for (I actually got laid off from my last job recently, yeck). But I do know that as sad as I would be if I lost her tomorrow, I would be fine in the end, much better than I was. I would at least feel secure in knowing that I'm capable of this. A lot of what consumed me for years will NEVER consume me again, and that in itself is such a massive burden off my shoulders. I'll admit, I have other issues with myself, and there is still a part of me that feels insecure at how long this has taken me. I still am sometimes dogged by the feeling of being way behind most other people, and I occasionally feel a sense of shame and loss about different life phases and rites of passage that I feel like I missed out on and can't get back. Maybe that will always be a part of me and I'll kind of always be like an alien. But at least I know I'm capable of a serious and happy relationship, friendships, and community, and all at the same time. I really am doing a lot better.\n\nThat's the funny thing too -- so many people act like getting a relationship and sexual experience won't really help or change anything (possibly because they're so used to having that that they have a hard time imagining any different). In my experience they're totally wrong. It's been a serious game-changer. Sure, it doesn't solve all problems, but it does solve a lot. Getting to the other side is much better, don't let anyone tell you any different.\n\nI think that covers my success story. I'm not one to give out advice because I know circumstances are very different for other people, and I know how much we dislike others assuming things about our situation and giving pre-canned advice. I know I am very lucky. I think it's best if I just lay this story out there, and people can make of it what they will. I hope it provides some hope, encouragement, or ideas. My heart goes out to others of you who have dealt with a lack of connection and experience over time even after serious efforts, and the self-hatred and alienation that can come with it. It is truly wrenching stuff.\n\nI may stick around to answer any questions or general responses, but beyond that I think this account will be pretty much dormant (as it was for a while until I finally got around to writing this). Thanks to this sub and in particular to the people who replied and reached out to me over the years. I'm sorry about some of my posts that were so miserable and occasionally even too dark for the sub, and I appreciate that people were so patient and understanding. I wish people here success, happiness, and love!\n\nAnd thanks to whoever bothered to read this whole thing. I have a hard time not writing long and detailed posts.",

The two decades of hormonal screeching in my ear? No more. The alienation from my peers over not having experienced a fundamental adult human activity? Gone. The complete lack of any shred of validation that I'm at all capable of being seen as attractive by the opposite sex? One win is infinitely more than zero. If it never happens again, yeah sure I'll be kinda sad about it, but I'll never return to quite the same depths of utter despair.\n\nAnyway, congratulations, especially starting at long distance. That's a true lottery win right there.",

I met her through a speed dating event, actually.\n\n\\-Meeting my current girlfriend online at age 29, flying her out for a week and getting to go on adventures with her, kiss, and hold hands just a little over a week before my 30th birthday.\n\nIn between all that I tried different singles gatherings and speed dating events, I tried cold approaches, I tried meeting someone through friends (which was hard enough as I hardly ever had friends and had trouble making them), and I tried the online dating thing (which just made me miserable). My dad even set me on a date with someone once. Nothing ever really took off.\n\nSo I guess 2009-2022, age 17-29, was my true \"forever alone\" era.

But i'd be lying if I didn't admit that it makes me HAPPY and EXTATIC to see these kinds of mindsets on this sub (as I had years ago), it was encouraging to see some positive energy here when I was FA, and it helped me not give up.",

At 36, I'm going through another transformation, getting my body fit (28 is definitely not too young for that specific thing).  I finished school at almost 30, so I know that too (still never got any \"college action\").\n\nSo much is against an FA, it is truly unfair and cruel and makes it hard to foster a positive self image and self care (as it did for me). One day I basically \"snapped\" and literally said \"fuck it, I'll do it selfishly for myself at the least\", it  eventually led me to move cities, further my music career, which led to mandatory socializing, which finalllly led to KV-status being lifted (over years and years). But a lot of that was no doubt luck (and managing to break the negative mindset of my unique FA-ness), and there is no concrete answer that works for everyone. One thing I'll say is that starting seriously NoFap was one of the \"triggers\" that began my mindset change, but that won't be effective for everyone (I had issues with internet porn).\n\nI do wish you all the luck! And my main hope is that I can serve as some kind of example that, indeed, it's not necessarily impossible to escape FA even at a \"late age\". Seeing the odd success story and posts like OP's always gave me a modicum of hope. Again good luck, congrats on losing all that weight, holy crap! I'll keep replying!",

(To be fair, it might have looked like i was holding my arm out for a hug, i'm not sure. But i'm left handed and held out my left and people tend to shake with the right). Either way she was fine with it. It wasn't a quick one either. It lasted a few seconds.\n\nAlso, I was the only one she hugged from what i saw.\n\nSo...i'm thinking of maybe asking her out. Not just because of the hug but there's been some other things that make me think it's worth at least taking a chance.

Allow me to tell you how I found peace with our situation at just 22 years old. First thing I did was ask out a few girls and get rejected. I’ve asked out like 5-6 girls in my life and either got rejected or they just wanted to be friends. \n\n\nSecond thing I did  is after reading post after post  online about guys who are in their 30s, 40s, and 50s and have never had a relationship before, something in my brain finally clicked. My brain finally started to accept and realize that so many guys in this world were unfortunately not meant to experience a romantic relationship in their lives. \n\n\nSo how did I accept this without feeling bitter or angry? Well it’s simple. I found peace with my situation due to the fact that I now know HOW many guys are in the same situation as me. Once I realized there’s a ton of guys out there like me who have never had a gf before, I realized I wasn’t alone going  through this.  \n\n\nAnd here is the last final recommendation I have to you guys on accepting this situation: traveling.  Traveling is good for for the soul. Travel out there to amazing places and see what the world has to offer. I highly recommend traveling to another country to get a true experience of what I mean. I promise you guys if you make it a goal to travel somewhere in Asia or Latin America, your outlook on life can completely change. \n\n\nAlso guys plz remember if u still need your sexual needs met and porn isn’t working then please see an escort. S sexual frustration is not healthy and it makes no sense to bottle up all of that inside of you and have no outlet. It will just make you even more depressed and miserable. Anyways that’s all I have to say. I wish you guys the best and hope you can find peace  🙏",

                "text_body": "I’m diagnosed with Asperger’s. I had a horrible and lonely childhood that resulted in me being ostracized. After graduating university, I bought a house in the country so I could get away from the society I now despised. I entered a deep and dark state of depression; suicidal thoughts crossed my mind multiple times as I hit rock bottom. \n\n\nI spent fifteen years alone, but I did not stand idly by and waste it. At twenty-three, when I was at my lowest, I knew I had to fix everything about myself before I could find redemption. \n\nToday, fifteen years later, I’m a new man. This is an overview of my journey that hopefully proves that time and effort can overcome mental illness and a lack of social intelligence. I solved my FA in three phases:\n\n\n\nPhase 1: The single best decision I’ve made, unbeknownst to me at the time, was to buy my little acreage in the country. The original idea of becoming a hermit is the very thing that eventually saved me.\nDespite being a nerdy guy with no real ‘adulting’ skills, I picked up my tools, and got to work. I built up a workshop then renovated my entire house, learning all the normal DIY skills that everyone should know along the way. Things like plumbing, electrical, woodworking, framing construction, etc. \nAlthough I didn’t see it at the time, this gave me confidence in my abilities and myself. I started to take on newer bigger projects, like restoring cars, and turning my land over to farming. All the while reading and expanding my knowledge on a wide range of topics ranging from biology, astronomy, philosophy, poetry, art, photography and film, hunting, fishing, and bushcraft. \n\n \nPhase 2: Whilst confident and assertive in my knowledge and skills, I still had no idea how to communicate. Now having interesting things to talk about, I wanted to tell someone. Social skills do not come naturally to those with ASD, thus I had to spend years learning, practicing, failing, adapting, and perfecting my skills. I literally had to study and take notes. I joined groups, made friends, and little by little, learned how to navigate a world designed for neurotypical people. Dating was still out of the question, but I now had friends and a veneer that hid my autism from the world. \n\n\nPhase 3: Dating requires one to be attractive. I didn’t know how to flirt, and injuries from my childhood bullies had left me permanently disfigured. Logically it made sense to fix my appearance first, so that I could practice dating. I had jaw surgery, a chin augmentation, rhinoplasty, eye surgeries, and skin treatments. I’m now somewhat attractive. Friends I trust have told me I’ve easily gone from a 4/10 to a 7/10. While looks are subjective, I now have no issues attracting women. It’s only been a couple months, but this is new and overwhelming. However I’m getting the practice I need to learn how to properly navigate this new world that has opened up to me. \n\n\nThat’s it. That’s how I went from a depressed, nerdy, socially awkward, isolated loner, to a ‘normal’ member of society that has no issues socializing, meeting people, and enjoying life. It took a long time, and is obviously vastly more complicated than this simple post, but it can be done. \n\nI wanted to share this because I legitimately have experience that might help those who want to change. If you don’t want to change, or think you can't,  then this post isn’t for you. \n\nIt's possible for some people to overcome their problems. I’m not going to say everyone just needs to work on self-improvement and ‘just have confidence,' because we all know that is bullshit advice. However, if you have any questions about making long term progress, I’d be happy to try and give you my perspective and advice.",

Back in highschool I was surrounded by beautiful classmates and my motivation was that if I improve myself, I would ask one of them on a date. But I didn't have means to improve back then and my parents didn't support me in my efforts. Nowadays I have much more freedom to work on my improvement but I lost my main motivation. \n\nI have no contact with girls so I lost my motivation. Most of my former classmates started ignoring my messages over time and I became bitter. I also had a crush who broke my heart after which I decided I was done with women. I realize it's bad thinking but I was unable to think otherwise because after that heartbreak, no other girl entered my life in any meaningful way. \n\nSo I guess my question is, how did you managed to find a motivation for all of this? How did you avoid becoming bitter and done with women during so many years of solitude?",

Every minute you spend wishing you had someone else’s life is a minute spent wasting yours. \n\nAlso, as your mental health increases, so will your motivation to further improve. It's cyclical. You need to make self-improvement a pattern, not a chore. Your morning and nightly routine are great places to start, since you already have a pattern that you can build upon.   \n\nI know why I get downvoted. It's because there are a lot of jaded and bitter individuals here that see anyone who's improved upon their situation as 'not FA enough.'

I just said that because it sound like you felt you needed the surgeries to be attractive and I don’t think you would have needed them to be attractive. But you’ve said it’s due to previous injuries so that’s a different thing. I just don’t like people feeling they need surgery or makeup to be attractive. \n\nYa attraction is very complex like I’ve not been attracted to someone and then I’ve become attracted to them after forming an emotional connection I’ve also seen guys that I just find attractive but I would never want them romantically or physically and then there are guys I’ve thought were attractive and have wanted them. Idk if it’s just my weird brain as I have adhd and possible autism. But either way it very much is a subjective thing. My main issue with my appearance has been that I’m over weight and don’t have big boobs or full lips but the only thing i definitely want to change is my weight which I am working towards and it will be a bit easier now that I know I have these mental health issues.

Throughout high school and college I was single, and I was just so used to being single that the thought of being in a relationship didn't even seem possible. I had no female friends, and I knew I wanted a girlfriend but like... I wasn't even really able to fantasize about having one because I didn't know what it would even be like to have a mature relationship, and it just seemed so far out of the realm of possibility. COVID was especially terrible with even more loneliness and isolation. YouTubers (and sadly Vtubers) began to fill the holes in my life that should have been filled by friends and a girlfriend. Moreso than ever, I couldn't imagine asking someone out, having them say yes, having a first date, having it go well... any of that, much less a full blown relationship. It sucked, and I did a lot of drugs and tried to avoid thinking about it. \n\nMy advice to you is just don't give up. The minute you give up, you close the doors on ever finding love. People will tell you all these bullshit ways to pick up women and blah blah blah. You don't need to approach women out of the blue and ask for their number, or have a lot of female friends and hope one has feelings for you. It's 2023. You can meet a woman online if you want to. Just you and another person, looking for a relationship, and seeing if you both are a good fit for one another. I met my girlfriend on Bumble and I could not be happier. Similar to how I couldn't imagine a relationship, I couldn't imagine living without her now. Our minds work in weird ways, but that's no reason to give up. \n\nI know it can be hard, but I really, truly believe anyone can do it if you have respect for women and make yourself somewhat presentable. There are plenty of women out there feeling the same way as you, and I'm sure one of them would love to meet you. You got it man.",

Kiss and relationship was done at 11, if you can even quality it as that.\n\nThe date went off without a hitch, hugging on meeting, she was engaged and sweet. There were many moments of laughing. Ultimately there seems to be a difference in worldview and not sufficient basis for alignment. For instance the nowadays typical radical views on vegetarianism, multiple tattoos and a bit too much spirituality. \n\nStill, i didn't go with the expectation of getting a girlfriend, but with the goal of having a first date. For that it was a success and showed me i CAN do it with extreme luck. (After 3 years of grinding online dating apps).",

Met her on Discord, been talking to her for over a week and we seem to have a lot in common- enjoys gaming, various nerdy things, sense of humor, introverted, and various outlooks on life.  I suggested we check out this food truck/music event on Wednesday evening and she seemed enthusiastic.  \n\nI do have some concerns though.  I'm 5'2, and judging from her photos, she's probably slightly taller than me.  I haven't told her my exact height, but she knows I'm short.  Can't help but feel insecure.  She's also younger than me, at 25.  I personally am not going to let an difference in age be a deterrant, but its a decent difference.  She's also extremely pretty- the type of girl I wouldn't even bother talking to because I'd assume she either had a boyfriend or 100 suitors.  I confess I initally thought she was a catfish, so I did reverse image searches  found her social media profiles.  Yes, I guess its stalker-ish but I wanted to make sure she wasn't a catfish- since then we had a brief videochat.  I still am quite surprised she would want to go out with me since there is such an extreme difference in physical attractiveness.\n\nI can't help but get my hopes up, even though I know its possible she could cancel/ghost, or just not be into me during our date.  In fact, statistically I know that's the likely outcome, but I still remain cautiously hopeful.  I put the tag as \"success story\" though that definitely remains to be seen.",

                "text_body": "At the beginning of 2019 I had just turned 30. I was unemployed, living with my parents, and not in school. A sequence of events took place where I managed to hit it off with a girl and finally escape being forever alone. I was an active poster on this subreddit at the time and ended up documenting the experience. If you’d like to know more about how it happened, everything culminated in this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/b46g02/somethings\\_happened/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/b46g02/somethings_happened/)\n\nA lot of people in the comments of that post advised me to leave the sub and not come back, which I did. However, whenever I log into this account, I’m often greeted with DMs asking for follow up. For those who have expressed an ongoing interested in my story, I’ve decided to publicly answer some of the common questions I’ve been asked. I’ll provide a little update at the end as well, as something rather remarkable has happened recently.\n\nFirst, here are some answers to the most common questions I receive.\n\n**Are you together still?**\n\nYes. More details on this later.\n\n**Are you still unemployed?**\n\nNo, a few months into our relationship I got a job. For about 6 months I changed motor oil at a near-by “quick lube” place. It didn’t pan out so now I work as a packaging worker (trimming packaging, gluing, folding cartons, blah blah blah).\n\n**Do you still live with your parents?**\n\nNo. Once my girl finished school and got established in her career we moved into an apartment together near her job. \n\n**Did you get your driver’s license?**\n\nUnfortunately no. This is something I’ve yet to tackle. \n\n**Was it easy after you escaped?**\n\nNo. The evolution of my personal self has been hell. I went from being a NEET to being required to function in adult society in the span of a few months. I felt like I was constantly on fire. For the most part I’ve settled into my new life now, but there are still plenty of moments that make my anxiety flare up.\n\n**What’s the hardest thing about being in a relationship?**\n\nGirls get hit on *constantly.* If you’re not within three feet of your girl in public, she will get hit on. When we’re at the beach, every time I go into the water while she stays on the beach some guy will walk up to her and try to chat her up. Experiences like this make me feel terrible because she’s sacrificing so many opportunities with better men just to be with me. She knows how I feel and tells me it’s not true, but it still gives me a pit in my stomach every time it happens. \n\n**Does the world treat you better when you’re in a relationship?**\n\nIt 100% does. Anyone who disagrees with this point has never walked a mile in our shoes. No matter how ugly, untalented, or socially awkward you are, the societal validation you receive from being in a relationship elevates you from sub-human to human status. \n\n**Your relationship started long after your youth. Do you feel bad that you’ll never experience a teenage romance?**\n\nThis was only asked once, but I’ve seen a few posts questioning a similar thing. I really don’t feel this way. We’ve biked to McDonald’s as the sun was setting, gone to see local fireworks on foot, window shopped at the mall, etc. These are the things I feel like I missed out on in adolescence, so I’m happy I finally have experienced them now.\n\n**Pics?** \n\nI made the mistake of sharing my girlfriend’s cosplay IG account with one person who asked. Needless to say there will be no pics, but at least one redditor agrees (in a vulgar way) that she’s very beautiful.\n\n**Recent Updates**\n\nIn June 2022 we got married. We didn't have a wedding. I wouldn’t have been able to stand the pressure and fortunately she wasn’t too interested in having one either. Instead we used her cosplaying prowess to do a couple really high end photo shoots. The first was with typical wedding attire and the second was cosplay of a NEET and his demon bride. \n\nLastly, the update that spurred me to make this post was we just found out she’s pregnant. Although not planned, this has been a wonderful surprise. \n\nThis news has really made me reflect on my life. Four years ago I was living at my parents, unemployed, never had a girlfriend, and didn’t even have a credit card in my name. If somebody told me I’d have a wife and be a dad in a few years, I would not have believed them. It’s insane how one lucky break can make your life go in a completely different direction.\n\n**Parting Words**\n\nOn a couple occasions I’ve been asked for advice in DMs. The thing is, I didn’t crack the girl code or suddenly became less ugly. I just got extremely lucky. I wish I had something uplifting to say but I don’t. Perhaps one thing I can say is I now see why normies don't understand the FA struggle. It's not their fault, but at the same time don't let them gaslight you with their uninformed views.",

All the other stuff is just trying to distract us from FA. It's busy work while we think it will help us escape FA. She gets hit on but she loves you. She chose you over those guys. That's so freaking good and you are an example of someone who escaped FA at an advanced age but just was yourself. Happy for you. Having a girlfriend helped you improve yourself. She gave you a reason to improve yourself and you got the energy to do all of what you did. She didn't leave you when a better option arose. I'm not saying women do this but people do this. That's how I know I will remain FA. You hit the lottery and found an exception. She sounds amazing. You did this on your own. I want to shake your hand. Congratulations dude!\n\nEdit, I 100% can tell you when you are with someone, you get treated better. I used to have woman friends and when I was alone nobody would talk to me but when I was with a woman friends people suddenly talked to us.",

I’ve felt this for a few years, but always pushed it aside because i’m young and thought “this is just dumb highschool girl problems”. but now i’m turning 20 in a few months and the feeling is still the same. i’ve accepted that despite all the work i’ve done on myself and that i love myself very much, my self love is not a replacement for romantic love. i will never get to experience the teenage romance i so badly wanted. it gives me happiness to see that it is possible to have a lucky break. i am truly so so happy for you and i wish you and your family (u have a family !!! i’m sure that’s insane to think about) the absolute best. at the same time it scares me because i hate to think that i might have to wait another decade to find love, but at this moment, i feel some hope. i also hope that you are able to heal from the trauma of experience loneliness to that degree.",

I had to have an appointment with my bank and meet someone in person to request the credit amount. Due to my social phobias and general lack of adult experiences, I was having an anxiety attack in the morning before the appointment. My girlfriend was so patient in comforting me. Later that day she had completed a new outfit and she wanted to go to a local public garden to take pictures. I was acting as the cameraman, and while we were taking a break a really tall and suave guy came up and started talking to her. He eventually ask for her number and she declined. He laughed it off, passed her a piece of paper, and said \"If you're worried giving your number out in front of your photographer will make him jealous, here's mine. You can message me later.\" To that she grabbed my arm, pulled me close to her side and angrily said, \"He's not my photographer, he's my boyfriend!\"\n\nIt felt so amazing to have her stand up for me like that, but I also felt such a massive pang of guilt. I was such a pathetic excuse of a man, yet she was turning down better opportunities just to be with me. \n\nEither way, there are a lot of things I've had to overcome, but it has definitely been amazing, and I really appreciate your kind words!",

You worked hard to overcome the challenges I'm sure but you see the difference when you have someone backing you up. You are obviously a quality guy and she is the woman of your dreams. Sometimes dreams do come true and they have for you. I'm jealous but I want to give you all the credit for knowing when you met the right one for you. How did you know at first she was different? The fact she could get with other guys but chooses you is what I'm most jealous of. She doesn't value anything else except who you are. She didn't find someone else because you were FA. Damn, what a great story to read when I'm at my lowest which I am. It's nice to read a 20 year old escaping FA but reading a 30 year old escaping FA makes my heart warm because I am what you used to be.

To borrow your analogy, there must be something about the game that makes it  worth playing, for there to be a point in playing the cards at all.

In the end, the most valuable thing he said was that Tinder tracks a lot of things you wouldn’t have thought would be tracked.\n\n* Tinder tracks how often you respond.\n* Tinder tracks how often you open the Tinder app.\n* Tinder tracks how long you look at someone’s bio.\n* Tinder tracks how complete your profile is.\n* Tinder tracks how often you ghost a conversation.\n\nImportant to note: He mentioned that these are just SOME of the things Tinder tracks, and that they are ‘weighted differently’. \n\nI hope to get the chance to ask more questions or find another employee to go more in-depth, so what would you ask a Tinder employee? I have been keeping a Google Docs file listing questions that people send me. Let me know and I'll add it to the list.",

I really do believe that a lot of people nowadays have a hard time talking to people on the fly and I’m one of them. I think I saw a research article in my psychology class talking about that too. Ik it’s hard not to but you can’t take it personal. \n\nLast fall in my first semester community college I tried face to face classes after 3 yrs of online in hs. And even though I made a total of 0 friends since I’d sit in the back of the class and never talk, one of my classmates actually spoke to me. She said basically what you wrote and even though I wasn’t able to keep the conversation rolling, I remember it like it was yesterday. I bet she doesn’t even remember my name or what I look like but I remember her. That’s bc it kinda made me happy at the time. I remember telling my mom about how I spoke to someone in school that day even tho we kinda only introduced ourselves…lol\n\nIk some people act like a dick when being talked to by strangers, but you’re doing wayyy more than a lot of people on this sub. Including me. And *apparently* I don’t have any social issues. \n\nHonestly if you keep it up, your chances of making a friend should only get higher, I think…",

                "text_body": "The world is a dangerous place.\n\nTo make it through it, we surround ourselves with familiarity: a city that we know, people we can trust, and repeating habits that take up our time in a predictable manner. All these things make up a shell around us and, inside this shell, we feel safe.\n\nIn 1905, at the age of 26, Albert Einstein proposed his theory of special relativity, introducing the fascinating concept of time dilation: time slows down when you are traveling at a fast speed. In 2016 and at the age of 24 — take that Einstein, I beat you by two years — I came up with an opposing theory. We could call it the time contraction phenomenon, and it’s formulated like this: the more you move, the slower time passes.\n\nWhat this theory implies is that time goes faster within your shell than it does outside of it. Inside, years pass by uneventfully and unnoticeably. Outside the shell, new experiences fill up your time and expand it. Therefore to live life to the fullest, it’s vital that you leave your shell behind.\n\nThis is the story of how I managed to break out of mine.\n\n\\-------------------------\n\nI was born, raised and ripened in the same city and place. I went to the local school, stayed there through my high school years, and moved on to the city’s university just a few blocks away. I never left my parent’s house. I hung out with the same people since eighth grade, barely expanding my social circle in college. By the time I got my degree at the age of 23, my shell was a bunker.\n\nWithin this shell, time was fleeting but weighed heavily. I tried my best to kill it — then innocent procrastination soon degenerated into a full-blown addiction to porn, consuming my hours in endless and self-destructive binges that left me emotionally numb.\n\nYet within the shell, I felt protected. Sure enough, I was trading safety for progress — shy and insecure, I was a kissless virgin with no life experience and very low self-esteem — but I was safe, after all.\n\nIt wasn’t until I graduated from college that I realized how much I had missed while locked inside that shell.\n\nPink Floyd’s *Time* resonated in my head:\n\n>*And then one day you find ten years have got behind youNo one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun*\n\nAnd so I decided to run, in an attempt to slow down time.\n\n\\-------------------------\n\nNot ready to become an adult yet, I decided to extend my condition as a student and applied for an international exchange program, and that’s how I ended up going to Germany for a year to get a Master’s degree.\n\nAhead of me, 365 opportunities to change things.\n\nOn board that plane, flying high up in the sky, it was easy to feel like I was already leaving my shell behind. Yet if you were to look at my seat — 23F, towards the rear end and by the aisle — all you would see there, sitting tightly and buckled up, would be a big, sturdy shell — a scared boy inside, hiding from the judgmental looks of dangerous strangers like you.\n\nGetting on a plane across the ocean doesn’t magically change you. My shell had packed me inside just like I had packed my favorite winter clothes in my brand new suitcase, and we all arrived in Germany as nervous and insecure as usual. Once at the airport, I remember staring at the train schedules on the wall for the longest time, incapable of finding my destination city in an endless list of rail lines, scanning the names over and over again with the vain hope that my train would miraculously show up in the list and spare me the embarrassment of having to ask a stranger for help.\n\nLife outside of the shell looked scary. My hostel appeared to me like a whaler inn straight out of Moby Dick. Shabby old men were arguing loudly over towering jars of beer in the common area. One of them shouted something at me from across the room, and it could have easily been the warmest welcome into his country, but there’s something about the German language that makes everything sound somewhat menacing to those of us that don’t speak it. A bit taken aback, I shyly excused myself and retreated into my room for the rest of the day, venturing outside only to grab some food — roaming the streets at that moment still felt like an overwhelming task, so three bananas that were up for grabs in the hostel’s kitchen were my entire dinner that first night.\n\nBeginnings are rarely easy, but they are always temporary — and it was the obstacles that were helping me progress, after all. I got to my destination because I eventually summoned the courage to ask someone for help finding my train, felt more comfortable at the hostel once I opened up and met two other foreign students staying there, and began to enjoy the city only after going for a first stroll in my surroundings.\n\nMy shell was still intact, but I could already feel it trembling. Despite fierce resistance, things were starting to happen.\n\n\\-------------------------\n\nI probably met more people in my first week in Germany than in the last ten years back in my home city, and this finally put my untested shyness to the test.\n\nAfter only three nights at the hostel, I moved into an apartment and met my three new flatmates, and even though we never became very close, they were a very kind first acquaintance and, through the year, an always readily available way to chitchat, socialize a little bit, and practice my German in the process.\n\nI made my first friend the day right after. I approached him at a welcoming event that they had for exchange students, struck up a conversation, and ended up sitting through the whole inauguration thing — and the lunch that came after — together. Making friends hadn’t been this easy since childhood, when all a kid had to do was be brave enough to approach another kid and straight-up ask: “*do you want to be my friend?*”. Having been myself ever so shy from the cradle, it felt cathartic to finally do what as a kid I’d never had the courage for.\n\nThrough my new friend I learned of a house party that other exchange students were having that same night. I jumped at the opportunity to keep honing my social skills and expanding my circle and joined. Five hours later, I was dancing to hard techno with a whole bunch of people I had met at the party, in a shady bar on the outskirts of the city, drunk as a fish and happy as a clam. The hammering of the music, the company of strangers, the unfamiliarity of the place, were all screaming at me to go back to the safety of my room, but I was having too much fun to listen.\n\nLike that baby velociraptor from Jurassic Park, I had poked a hole in my eggshell and was peaking at the outside world through it, ready to be reborn out of extinction.\n\n\\-------------------------\n\nThe rest of the year was a continuation of this positive trend. I made a few very good friends and more acquaintances than I can remember. I hung out, partied, and traveled with them all over Europe. In short, I had lots of fun.\n\nYet I also grew a great deal as a person. I learned to stand on my feet — to provide for myself and to solve my own problems — as well as to enjoy my independence. I lived through a number of new experiences that opened my mind as much as my heart.\n\nAll this progress eventually permeated that area of my life in which I was most immature. Over the months, I slowly let go of my inhibitions around girls, and knocked down barriers that had towered above me for years. I had my first kiss, my first dates, and my first sexual experiences there, and thus liberated myself from my most adamantine shackle.\n\nAfter a long period of reclusion, I finally stood free.\n\nThe shell had been broken.\n\n\\-------------------------\n\nWe are the choices that we make. In a desperate situation — feeling physically constrained and mentally stuck — the most intelligent choice I could make was to leave. Yet the experience wouldn’t have been the same without all the other little decisions that came after, which little by little — and not without pain — pushed my boundaries and made that year a transformational one.\n\nBreaking out of my shell was an exercise of courage as much as it was a result of my environment. It took guts to put myself in a situation that I knew was going to test my limits, but once I set things in motion my new surroundings started working in my favor, and embracing all those new experiences became gradually easier. By the time it came to an end, I realized I had lived more in that one year than in the rest of my life. Not only that, but I was able to leave some of my bad habits behind, tucked away inside of that broken shell.\n\nMy addiction to porn didn’t disappear, but it fell back to more manageable levels during the time that I spent in Germany. It would be easy to blame it on my busier schedule (not only did I have a more active social life, but my studies were also pretty demanding and I balanced them with a part-time job) yet it would be naive, too. After all, I could have still found a few hours to binge porn every once in a while if I wanted to.\n\nWhat was really happening was that my more eventful life was not just occupying my time but, more importantly, it was filling the emotional gaps that I had always tried to fill before with porn. To my surprise, porn lost much of its appeal amidst this bustling and fulfilling new life of mine, and my hours-long binges gave way to a more restrained and casual relationship with porn, essentially leaving the worst of my addiction behind.\n\nMy experience in Germany taught me the value of moving and, ever since then, I haven’t stopped. I keep looking for new experiences and opportunities to grow, finding comfort in my environment but avoiding stagnation. It’s this mindset that’s behind all the progress that I’ve made in the last few years: beating my addiction to porn, building a solid and loving relationship with my partner, overcoming my problems with sex and intimacy.\n\nAs I continue to work on myself, I don’t forget where everything started, and how important getting out of my comfort zone was for me back then.\n\nI’ve come a long way since I broke out of it, but my steps can still be traced back to that shell.",

                "score": 163,
                "text_body": "I entered December 2022 as a 26 year old virgin who never romantically held hands, hugged or kissed a girl. Over 8 weeks, my life turned around. If someone told me how lucky I'd get, with what a dream of a woman, I would've laughed to their face and bitterly responded such stories only happen in fairytales, or romcom anime. But my story of being ForeverAlone no longer is completely true, I'll offered proof to people asking on other subreddits.\n\n\\*\n\nI didn't really have a social life since high school. Massive social anxiety, diagnosed by multiple psychologists. I lived in quiet despair, with medication merely numbing the pain, as many of you do. Longing for a relationship, but unable to pursue one. And also doubtful I could even connect to a girlfriend, as I developed typical \"nerd\" interests - architecture, poetry, visual arts and classical music - while feeling alienated from the interests of my peers. My phone contacts were limited to family & colleagues. The only people to notice by birthday were my parents, grandparents and brother (who had a girlfriend, of course, despite being younger than myself). To put it short, I was an archetypical r/ForeverAlone reader.\n\nSo how did I suddenly meet a dream girl, even as my social circle had a radius of zero? ... Tinder? Gym? Bars? No. It's unbelievable. ***I got a girlfriend by being nice to an old lady.*** She's a friend of relatives. She gave private lectures on art history to improve her meagre pension. I've been a regular pupil of hers - and gradually became her favorite pupil. One day, she gave my number to her 21 year old granddaughter, unprompted. We were both evidently lonely, liked by her, and in her mind that was reason enough to help us meet. An elderly womans' whim turned my life around.\n\nSo I received an unlikely message: \"Hello, my grandmother told me you're a very intelligent young man. Would you like to meet?\": something along the lines was the invitation for the first date of my life. *That girl must be SOOO desperate*, I thought. What kind of young woman approaches a man first? Asks him out, based on nothing but her *grandmothers description of me*? So I imagined her unattractive. Nonetheless, I was glad to spend time with a young woman for the first time in years.\n\nI met someone I wasn't expecting. At all. A girl with fine features, with long, silky raven hair, blue eyes, pale skin. Smells of shampoo. Small and petite. No model, having some flaws, but very pretty. Moreover, probably more importantly: she was very intelligent, well-read, capable of maintaining conversations about abstract and scientific topics. Almost a male fantasy, rather than a real young woman. Not the kind of girl you'd ***ever*** imagine being desparate for a date. But she was, every bit as lonely and desperate as myself.\n\nAs I gradually learned, she's as socially handicapped as myself. She struggles understanding emotions. Some mild form of Aspergers, I assume (I will never ask outright, out of tact). She needs strong clues to figure out why people felt or said something. So she doesn't understand movies with morally complex protagonists, for example. Or many of her peers. She spent her days in isolation: studying, reading books and manga, gaming, drawing, developing a fantasy world inside her head. (Just like myself.)\n\nOf course. She still got hit on, by virtue of her looks. Often, as her relatives told me. She rejected every guy before me. I a*ssume* (don't know for sure) because they just wanted to get in her pants, without consideration for her psyche. Female friends were difficult for her, as well. She told me how on parties, she'd just stand around, confused why everyone was so happy and loud. Refused to interact with the drunk guys. So other girls stopped inviting her. She confided in me: \"***People only ever like me briefly. Probably because I am beautiful. Once they see how weird I am, they ignore me.***\"\n\nBut to me, her social alienation and the bookish hobbies she developed to compensate for them, weren't flaws at all. They are treasures. They made her my soulmate. Because I shared her experiences of avoiding people and sticking to an inner world. Her obsession with natural sciences and arts made talking to her much more interesting than to any \"well-adjusted\" woman.\n\nHer \"undesirable\" personality is the best part about her to me. Pretty women? There's millions of them, they're ubiquitous. But: women I could talk to for hours and hours? **One**. In her I met exactly one, for my whole lifetime. And she told me a similar thing: I've been the first male peer in her life to \"get\" her. I don't care whether it's due to her mild Aspergers, or us sharing a history of social isolation: I prefer talking to her to any other human.\n\nWe simply *connected*. Mostly due to similar psyches, not due to looks.\n\nShe remarked she found my height and hair attractive. She reacts to what I wear and wears tasteful makeup herself, aware of its effects on men. She knows she is beautiful. So despite being emotionally incompetent, she is still a woman, with sexual instincts and preferences. And I may have satisfied *some* of her preferences.\n\nI cannot describe reliably how handsome I am. As a byproduct of general social anxiety and self-esteem issues, I feel disgusted whenever I look at myself in the mirror; even though I've been called handsome sometimes. But either way, there's a ***zero, 0%*** chance I'm more handsome than *everyone* whom she rejected before. So she didn't pick me for looks primarily.\n\nWe went on eight dates, each 5-7 hours long, visiting art and museums we both genuinely enjoy. I introduced her to just sightseeing, shopping and eateries, as well. As were both kissless, clueless virgins when we met, our physical intimacy developed at snails' pace. It took me three long dates to stroke her hair and *five to even peck her lips*. By date eight, we've become one of those obnoxious young couples eagerly making out in public transport. We haven't slept yet (update 11.02.23 - we did). \n\nShe gave me what I longed for. Fun dates with a girlfriend, a profound human bond, touches, tenderness, **connection**. Eventually sex, but at the point I got it, I no longer even cared that much.\n\nI've *partially* recovered from the burn scar that's been my \"social\" \"life\" before her. I could finally show my relatives photos of me dating someone (ironically, a girl prettier than any socially well-adjusted male relative). I stopped fearing the many young women in my company: no, I won't ever dare approaching/flirting, but I *finally stand my ground* in their presence. I greet them, without shamefully avoiding their gaze. I also stopped recoiling when normies talk about girlfriends, dating - been there, done that. Merely the topic of sex still puts me at unease - I did it, but have a pitiful amount of experience.\n\nI've experienced more physical tenderness in two months than in my entire life before. I am still excited to hear about the masses of books she's read during her years of isolation. Whenever we meet, she just falls into my arms, like a wounded bird into her nest, almost begging to be caressed. She texts me often, imagining a future together. Her eyes dim with joy whenever I kiss her neck.\n\nSo what do I have left to fear now? Well ... as it turns out: everything. I still fear *everything*. Why? We arrive at a bitter truth.\n\n\\*\n\n**A girlfriend will not heal mental sickness!**\n\nI can say now, from experience. I dismissed this truth as smug normie \"advice\", along the lines of \"learn to be happy single\". See, I don't feel like a non-loser, despite experiencing nothing less than a triumph that should've skyrocketed my confidence. No, I just feel like a loser who got a girlfriend through luck: that's what I am.\n\nMoreover, a loser whom she might leave at any moment. Even as she shows no signs of becoming less attached to me, whatsoever, I am deeply afraid. When she takes a bit longer to text me, I imagine she ghosted me. Yes, I fear her spontaneous ghosting, after *eight long dates*, after taking her first kiss, after her always agreeing in advance to go on several more date scenarios (including coming to my apartment, visiting other cities and *meeting my parents*). After her refering to herself as my girlfriend unprompted.\n\nI'm still afraid she might just randomly decide \"naaah, screw this weirdo\". I'm as sick and paranoid as I ever was. And because of this, I'll return to social isolation should she leave me.\n\nI don't have advice to offer. I'm mostly plain lucky. I realize that. But: countless people here seem to have mental illness on the anxiety and insecurity spectrum, similar to mine. Treat your mental illness separately from your dating life (or lack thereof), please! The illusion a partner will heal your mental woes is, indeed, an illusion. I am proof. I went from zero romantic experience to dating my dream girl in mere weeks. But my self-worth barely budged. I am r/ForeverAlone no longer, but still retain the mindset that might cause me to become r/lonely again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I've treated you to both a sweet success story and a bitter acknowledgement with this post. Make of it what you want, consider it bragging if you want (it's not - ask any normie, he'd have ten times the romantic experience by 26). I genuinely thought it's a capital \"L\" Lovestory, worth sharing.",

The movie is about Jim Carrey saying \"yes\" as much as possible, and then good things happen to him.  It isn't really the best movie, but it is inspirational and I do recommend watching it. \n\nIn order to enjoy life as much as you can and have good relationships with people. It is important to say \"yes\" as much as you can.  Even when your mind says \"no.\" It is good to give out random 'yes'-es. \n\nIn my opinion, it is better to do things and then regret wasting some time and money, than forever regret not doing things.  I went to my 10 year high -school reunion.  The options were either A. Go and have a chance at wasting $25 and 3 hours.  Or B. Forever regret not attending the reunion.  It is better to choose option A.  And I didn't regret spending $25 and 3 hours of my life.  I had a pretty good time and met some old friends from high-school.",

                "text_body": "I started this account 8 years ago. I didn't post because there was the 30 karma threshold. Recently my device stayed logged in with this account and I started actively reading this sub again. I started commenting on other subs so I could get to 30 karma.\n\nIn 8 years I can say the demographic of the sub has changed a bit, it used to be a bit of a mix between those who had been in relationships, and those who had trouble connecting while in them. \n\nI'm here to share a \"success story\" but I was definitely one of the latter. I was someone who got their first girlfriend much later than my peers and just had lots of trouble connecting with people. I'd typically meet a girl, date for anywhere from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, feeling awkward and not myself the entire time, then we'd break up and I'd be alone again usually for a year more, sometimes as long as two years. Maybe I didn't fit the classic FA mold but I felt lonely too, and I created this account when I was in my late 20s after like 10 years of this and moving to a new city where I was apart from even platonic relationships. I had come to terms with the fact I would probably never be the type who married or in a stable relationship - just had these weird periodic trysts. \n\nI did end up meeting someone though. She was very different than most of the other girls I had ever dated and it turned out to be the greatest thing ever. We eventually moved in together, fell in love, we're married and have children. I had my first biological child at age 35. I wanted to post this because I know there are others like me, and I want to share that it \"can happen\".\n\nThe dreaded unasked for advice I will give anyway:\n\nIf you're in a similar spot as me I'd advise you to expand your tastes. My wife was very different than all other girls I dated. I had such a hard time connecting with people before I typically did it with alcohol. Lots of the women I dated liked to \"party\" - I did it to kind of break through the tension, I think for many of them it was a lifestyle. Lots of them had a certain body type. My wife was neither of these things.\n\nThere's a classic piece of advice of \"learn to love yourself\" - and yes, I agree this is real. I can tell you the reason though is when you're self loathing, you become difficult to spend time with. No one wants to spend the evening reassuring someone they're a decent person, it's exhausting. Long ago, I started doing lots of different hobbies, music, cars, travel, computer games, reading - I grew to feel comfortable hanging out by myself, I think I grew to like myself after realizing I wasn't bad company. I saw someone else post recently they got into a relationship and got this validation that way - I agree, I think you can get it from someone else, but I also think you can get it on your own and it's probably less fragile.\n\nI think platonic relationships are good. I won't pretend they are some kind of substitute for romantic ones, but romantic relationships should have all the facets of a platonic one, with some more on top. It can also ease some of the loneliness. \n\nTLDR: I began lurking 8 years ago. I went on to meet someone and have a family.",

I used to be more confident, but I got into a relationship with someone who had self-esteem and identity issues. He didn’t like himself, and refused to believe that I liked anything about him, regardless of how often I tried to assure him. Not only was it exhausting, but at a certain point, I just couldn’t keep validating him anymore and he began to lash out and treat me like I wasn’t a good person. After all, a worthwhile person would not be with someone like him. That meant I was a trash human that couldn’t get anyone else.\n\n I did get out of that relationship. But I had legitimately cared and tried, and it still ruined my self esteem. You can only hear bad things and names thrown in your face so many times before you start to internalize them. The idea that you’ll meet someone who holds your head and rubs your back while kissing you on the forehead saying, ‘everythings gonna be ok’ and that will fix all your problems is misguided. It would help, for sure. But you have to be in a mental space where you like yourself enough to accept that care. Otherwise, you’ll just project your self-loathing onto others and bring them down with you.",

First off, no there isn't. The idea of approaching a stranger like that is truly some boomer shit - in large part that behavior is considered creepy by anyone today. I know you see these kinds of things in TikTok, and sometimes movies but it really is an unrealistic expectation. I used to believe this too. I'd go out to club, I'd try to talk to women, I'd get rejected, and I'd get upset thinking \"somewhere\" \"someone\" is just getting it all. No they aren't. I think the sooner people shed that kind of belief, the better off they are. \n\nAs far as where I meet women - anywhere I have repeated contact with them enough to feel comfortable asking them to do something in a way that doesn't feel like I'm a creep.

Do not be afraid of growth, as that is an essential part of life. Be afraid of stagnation and the social stigma of remaining the same guy year after year after year. Don't feel despair, feel *pride*.\n\nYou're out there seeking connection and not finding it, and that is indeed frustrating, but realistically, what you're experiencing is normal. It's hard to make friends in real life for nearly everyone. However with who you are now and who you continue to become, you will be able to cast a wider net to appeal to more people. You're out there, growing, sharpening and polishing yourself, experiencing life, even with the limits imposed upon you. You have better chances now to find connection than you did in the past. This is the optimistic way to look at your situation, as adopting a pessimistic view will just lead to self-destruction.\n\nSince you're in college, I'd recommend trying a beginner's PE course for some recreation and exercise. You'll be surrounded by other noobs making noob mistakes and helping and encouraging each other to be less nooby. In the process, you'll probably make friends there too since there are shared goals and shared progress while participating in a recreational activity.",

(Different girl than last time)\n\nI thought she'd never like me because her hobbies were different from mine, and she's two full inches taller than me. \n\nSince she was cute as hell and I had a dumb joke to make related to her profile pictures, I sent a message anyway. \n\nSure enough, she ran with my dumb joke, and we made plans for Saturday afternoon. \n\nI checked the forecast Saturday morning and realized it was going to feel like 20 degrees F outside. \n\nThis fact, paired with the hour-long train ride to meet her there, made me seriously consider bailing and just playing video games at home where I would be warm.\n\nBut miraculously, right before I finished sending the text that I was gonna cancel on her and stay home, she sent a text picking the place she was going to. \n\nFrom there, I realized I was locked into this date, and I would be a jerk if I were to leave her there. \n\nSo I showered and made it to the train station. Truth be told, I didn't shave my face and I threw on a flannel shirt and jeans and left.\n\nI then realized while on the train that I was going to be 30 minutes late, and I started panicking about the bad first impression I was leaving on this girl before even meeting her in person.\n\nI sent her a text letting her know I would be running late, and what stop I was at on the train. \n\nShe was okay with that, and we finally met. \n\nI walk down the hall and I'm suddenly struck by this taller girl with light red hair, freckles and cherry red lipstick standing by the door. It's her and wow, she a cutie. \n\nSo we say hi to each other and she leans in for a hug.  In my head Im like nice! Even though it's a formality for first dates, I liked hugging her.\n\nSo we start walking together talking about ourselves. One good tip Ive heard is to hit on each of the FORD points over the course of the date: family, occupation, relationship, dreams.\n\nThis girl is really cool! She has a lot of interesting travel experiences and she knows a lot about different things, someone I feel like I could talk to.\n\nWe go to some small mac and cheese place there for lunch (my treat, I took out my card before she could pay for herself) and joke around about random stuff.\n\nWe then find a place to sit and take off our jackets. She could see me in a red flannel and jeans, and she wore a royal blue buttoned blouse and jeans that really went well with the red lipstick. I felt like I was talking to royalty, no pun intended.\n\nOne thing that's hard to do here is the right amount of eye contact. Between her round brown eyes, cute smile and what was below the neck, there was a lot to look at to say the least.\n\nI did not want to be creepy and stare too much, which I feel like I did in some dates a while back.\n\nHowever, I did want to give her good eye contact to show that I'm listening and that I'm interested in what she has to say.\n\nSo over lunch is where we really talked about ourselves: likes/dislikes, unpopular opinions, stuff about where we grew up, hobbies, music, tv shows, all that stuff. \n\nI feel like I overdid it with the puns and light innuendos, but she was laughing along with me the whole time. \n\nAfter lunch, we went together to a novelty shop that sells all kinds of \"nerdy\" merchandise like Star Wars, anime, band tshirts, vinyls, all that. \n\nIt felt like going together with a friend, only your friend is really cute and you dont know as much about her. We looked around at all the stuff, shared funny stories related to what we saw, music we like, all that good stuff.\n\nThere was a private hallway at the exit of the store, where I made some ironic joke that she responded by saying I was doing a \"good job\". \n\nFinally we left the store, and were now standing in the cold and falling slush.\n\nFrom there, she mentioned she had to look up nearest train stop from where we were. \n\nThis was about an hour and a half into our time together. \n\nDue to my questionable self-esteem and dull first dates in the past, I was ready for her to just wave her hand goodbye and walk away for good. I told her I appreciated her waiting for me and that I had a great time.\n\nBut then, she leaned in and moved her face closer to mine. I had to think for a split-second what this meant. Is she really meaning to kiss me? \n\nThe only time this happens, it's a kiss from my relatives or aunts. My mom's wise words of \"you only kiss someone on the lips if it's your wife, anyone else it's on the cheek\" came up in my head, so I aimed for her cheek for a millisecond to be more courteous. \n\nNope, she was aiming for the lips after all.\n\nWow. It was a short one, almost like a kiss from an aunt, only right on the lips. And from a much better-looking girl of course.\n\nAt this moment, I realized that I am no longer a 25 year-old kissless virgin, I am just a 25 year-old virgin.\n\nI thought about that moment for the rest of the day, playing back the scene of her leaning in and giving me a small kiss goodbye. \n\nI felt that for all of those sad nights alone in my room, that's what I had to go through to finally know what it's like to kiss a girl. \n\nSo now I'm wondering does that kiss mean anything, or is it just another \"polite\" thing to do on a first date even if you don't plan to see that person again? \n\nWould that be a sign that she enjoyed our time and would like to go out again?\n\nTLDR: I had a first date/hangout with a girl from a dating app. We had some mac and cheese, talked about random stuff, and went to a novelty store. Before she left, we kissed on the lips for my first time ever. \n\nNow I'm not sure if that's a sign she would like to go out with me again, but I'm happy to have experienced that.\n\n\nEDIT 1/19: It's been four days and she just texted back saying she didn't see it working out. It looks like I won't be leaving you guys just yet.",

I also believe despite our lack of experience, has sort of given us the experience of understanding not being needy. We have weathered being alone for so long, lack of attention barely affects us now. We are used to it.\n\nThat's why in your eyes... even a little kiss on the lips is a HUGE deal. In reality though, it's a good sign but don't read into it too much. I've heard of stories of kisses and then moving on. My best advice is to just have fun and go with it. The minute you start trying and overanalyzing is how you bring up your anxiety. If it doesn't last then so be it. Every little bit counts. Baby steps and learn to appreciate every moment.",

Not as long as some of the people on this sub, but to me a pretty long time.\n\n....\n\nSo I want to thank everyone for being with me while I was FA. I thought I was some sort of abnormal outcast. You people made me feel okay.\n\nStuff I did/ changed:\n\n1) college. Moved colleges.\nEnvironment matters a lot.\nIf everyone in your school thinks your the short, awkward nerd who lived in the library all day, it's going to be pretty hard to change that impression even if you drastically change behavior.\n\n2) got in shape. This mostly involves eating more stuff for me, but for some people it'll be losing weight. Two sides to every coin I guess. I'm still not that muscular yet, but got a hymn membership and will be working on it.\n\n3) lost the fear of rejection / didn't care any more. Yes. This makes the sex worse & less meaningful. But I know a lot of you feel like social rejects - as did I - and it's better than that, let me tell you.\n\n4) learn a skill. It can be anything. Juggling, telling stories, giving Impromptu massages. Singing, guitar etc. It impresses girls. I learnt magic. It's super convenient. Every time I've gotten gf has been after a magic show. Each one of my friends who are in a relationship are either:  super smart / star student / Muscular jock / really tall / great speaker / great storyteller / great rope dancer? ( this was was 5'3 and got laid like a warlord - exception & luck yes, but I'm 5'5 - 5'6 & I had a lot of insecurities about my height before this.)\n\n5) Escalate. Escalate. Escalate.\nNow.\nYou guys.\nDon't be rapey or anything.\nIf you escalate properly, the girl will be super into it as well. She'll begin initiating stuff. With glee. Believe me.\n\nAt least that's what my experience was like. It was her first time too, so some awkwardness but not much.\n\n6) get out of your own head / seek advice from a friend (if you don't have friends, use this sub).\n\nAt first I thought I was going crazy, seeing signals that weren't there. Then, I described it to a good friend. She called me an idiot for not getting that this girl was really into me. So, I took a break from my own self discouraging thoughts & resolved to make sure I heard the words from her own mouth.\n\n7) learn to find the clirotis. / be prepared at all times. \nGoogling clitoris will not help, the diagrams are shitty. Search on pornhub for some really good guides. First time I've used pornhub productively.\n\nHonestly I didn't think I was going to get laid today. Max cuddling I thought. Where I am from the culture is super conservative. So I didn't expect much. But, I still trimmed, shaved, brushed well & took a good bath, cleaned my room & rehearsed some magic just in case the best scenario occurred.\n\nIt occurred.\n\nYou don't want to miss the opportunity when you get it.\n\nPeace.\n\nEdit: The sex didn't feel that great afterwards (in the moment it felt pretty awesome tho) & I thought I'd become happy after this but I am not.\n\nBut you can only say this after having sex.\n\nI tried \"being happy & satisfied\" in other ways. They all worked, but the fact I never had any human sexual intimacy in my life was always at the back of my mind.\n\nRight now, I'm worried about my school & the lack of money.",

You're going on dates with girls who are not that into you. Don't do that. Your time is valuable.\n\nThink of it this way, you can only be with a girl if she already likes you.

I doubt I'm remembered but not too long ago I made a post here called A quick chat about my loneliness. I said I'll reply back if things went well. And it was a success. The party was great. I had a blast. And on top of that, I got to talk to the girl I was interested in a couple days later. We've been talking for a while now. Things are good between us too. I can say that I got everything I wanted, and I still don't feel happy. I keep thinking that the girl is going to lose interest in me sooner or later and talk to someone else. I don't even know why she's actually interested in me.\n\nThe point is, I know some of you here are probably lonely that they can't get a girl with them. Having one isn't the answer. You really should focus on yourself for a long time before you can get a girlfriend. I probably am not going to stay long with this girl because I feel like I'm inadequate with everything. My hobbies, my schoolwork, being a brother. Like I don't measure up.\n\nI still feel like an outsider. A little depersonalization. Like I'm not there. One step at a time though.\n\nBut yeah, I'd say this is a success story. I had fun at the party, and I got the girl I'm interested in. It's possible. We got this!",

I was disappointed that Steff rejected me - I thought we had a good, flowing conversation and established a bit of a connection. All the other conversations were hard work. But I don't care in the least that the other eight rejected me even though I felt I was good enough (or more than good enough) for them. I no longer need sexual validation, whether it's from pretty, average-looking or ugly women. A few years ago I would have cared about their validation, but now I don't. \n\nAs for Steff, like I said it was disappointing, but I don't feel diminished or humiliated by her rejecting me, which at one time I would have. I thought, after all, who knows what was going on in her mind? She may have lots of other options, she may be on Tinder, she may already be casually dating someone. Even if I'm the most desirable man in the room, I still may be nothing special to her. \n\nMaybe I'll go to another event like this, maybe not, but at least now I know that if I fail, I'll be able to take it in my stride and not get depressed about it.",

                "text_body": "Hey everyone. How are you, guys? How's the year 2022 treating you so far?\n\nI tagged this thing as \"success story\", because it's the closest thing we have in terms of tags, but this is in no way a bragging on my part. **This is intended to share my personal experiences and observations, and hopefully, help someone else about the same problems** that I had and still to an extent have.\n\nNow, in purity terms, I'm only about 90% FA. I was always a romantically challenge dude, being an introverted scrawny kid from a poor family, with a number of personal issues, divorced parents and all, that often expressed themselves in needy behavior, and no steady masculine role model to learn healthy traits from. As such, my first attempts at meeting someone and creating a meaningful relationship with them crashed and burned hard at every step. I *did* manage to have sex a few times back then, there's that - but frankly, it felt kind of empty, as in all cases it was something that just... happened, and likely would've happened to any other dude at my place. Anyway, at some point I stopped achieving even that questionable successes for a number of reasons, and went full-single - not by choice. This state of numb existence continued roughly until my 33th birthday.\n\nThen, right at the eve of the New 2021th Year, I met a girl on the Russian counterpart of Facebook, we started talking, then we met, and **suddenly I ended up in a full-blown relationship, living together with another person and loving each other.** It failed after six months, though, by choice, though there's no regrets. That's a story for another time and another comment section.\n\nAfter spending the next half a year recovering, in December I logged again to the dating apps installed on my phone, and - what do you know - right before the New 2022th Year met *another* girl through those. Again - **we texted, we met, we talked, we went sexual, we considered starting a relationship, but quickly realized that it wouldn't work anyway** due to our differences in lifestyle, standards, future plans, etc. But we split on the good terms, in any case.\n\nNow, as I said - it wasn't intended as a bragging. Neither story managed to work in the long term, anyway, which is what I strive for. But there is a saying: *\"Once is an accident; two is a coincidence; three is a pattern.\"* **The two events happening eerily similarly exactly a year apart, got me thinking about what was in common between them**; what was it that I did right these two times. After all, somehow it didn't feel like something that happened *with* me; it felt like something that I *made* happen - for the better or the worse.\n\nNow, what can we try and access from that?\n\n1. We met through the Internet - a social network and a dating app, respectively. Yes, we all know how the statistics goes against men at those, but still. **It allowed me to create the first impression using my personality, and not my looks** (which, to be fair, still suck - scrawny body, an overbite, bad teeth, dressing like a hobo, etc.) which would automatically repelled her without me having any chance. Also, it helped me to understand the *other* person's character and decide if I'm actually willing to try building something with her. Meeting a random girl on the street solely because of her looks surely wouldn't produce the same result. Finally, we all here have an undertandable problem with social skills, and the direct blunt approach that works for the pick-up masters wouldn't work for us, either.\n2. In both cases it was me who initiated the contact, and it wasn't some stock \"Hi how are you\"**,** but **enquiring about some bits that I actually felt interested in.** The first one had a song from an obscure band on her page (Darkseed - The Fall, if someone cares); the second one mentioned a pet tarantula she has - and I have one too, so there's that. In both cases, it created a natural excuse for a dialogue and created a genuine interest in the person that I wouldn't be able to fake; it was probably unique enough to stand out from tons of other guys writing them every day; and it was something personal that they both were interested talking about.  \nA helpful side note: **the secret ingredient of talking to people is -** ***don't***. Everyone loves talking. Nobody like to listen. So, if you make a conscious decision to shut up and let the other person talk about what *they* want to talk about, occassionally commenting or asking to make sure that you're invested and interested, things will basically roll from there on its own. Not necessarily in romantic direction, but still - it helps, immensely so.Anyway.\n3. Once it felt that we have a naturally flowing conversation - not some magical \"the one\" thing, but just a normal human talk where nothing felt weird or forced - I took the opportunity to offer a date (it worked both times), and consequently, after spending a date in personal company of each other and learning that the \"normal human conversation thing\" was still going, I offered them a serious relationship on the *second* and the *first* date, respectively. I donn't know why, it didn't really went that far for me, I just decided to try that. **Either offer was open for either \"yes\" or \"no\", was made as we were about to part ways, when she didn't feel cornered or threatened somehow** (it's a big thing for girls), **and she knew that I wouldn't pursue or harass her in case I wouldn't like the answer, and she could leave in any moment if it felt uncomfortable.** I also made the point that I'm willing to take it slow and not to rush things, to build it steady and stable (hey, after waiting ten years, I could afford to wait a few weeks, right?) - which, ironically, led to us having sex on the *fourth* and the *second* date, respectively. That's some really weird math thing going on there.\n\nAll in all, I was completely flabbergasted by each success as much as any of us would. It felt weird, because when being younger, I thought that you need a \"right\" memont for something like that, but it turns out that **you don't need a \"right\" moment - you need a \"*****normal*****\" moment.** Girls and women are usually pretty closed about men they don't like or trust, so if you're just having a conversation about some personal stuff and she's okay talking to you about it, relaxed and open-minded, then she already trusts you more than most others.\n\nThe thing is, even if a woman is romantically interested you, she will still *not* show it and expect *you* to take the risk and responsibility of asking her out (unfortunately, that's the Western dating culture that we're all brewing in. It's unfair, I completely agree with you, but that's how it is. Take it or leave it, I guess).\n\nOn the other hand, **she wants to classify you as either a \"romantic interest\" or \"a sexless friend\" as soon as possible**, and moving from one group to another is damn near impossible. If you, like me, had a prolonged  \"friendships\" with girls and women in the past, which led to nowhere, you know what this is about. So, if you clearly set up your direction from the get-go, she will either agrees to these terms, or denies it outright and you won't waste the time and energy on imagined relationship that will never come to be.\n\nIt also make things better for *you* \\- **since this may be a first or a second time when you even see this person, you haven't emotionally attached to her yet**, and it is much easier to take \"no\" for an answer, and go all \"understandable, have a nice day\" instead of throwing a crazy Othello fit.\n\nNow, as we already said, two separate cases do not qualify as a pattern yet. And frankly, I'm not sure if I even should to be trying for the third time - both relationships made me overanalyze my personality, and if my character traits really fit for establishing and maintaining the long-term relationship with a decent person. But anyway, feel free to ask me how the things are after the 2023th New Year's Day.\n\nAnd please, tell us about your own, of course.\n\nI hope they'll work out in the end.\n\nBest of luck.",

Never in a million years did I think I would make it, certainly not online. I won't lie to you lads, this was a complete fluke and I have no idea what I did to get so lucky. We're several states apart so we probably won't be meeting in person anytime soon, but just listening to her voice speaking softly to me makes me feel like I've never felt from anyone before. The whole morning, I've been smiling like one of those people we're all been so jealous of. I think I've become one of those people that yesterday I hated. It actually makes me angry how much this fits the \"you'll find someone when you least expect it\" that pisses us all off so much because this came COMPLETELY out of nowhere and if you'd told me last year it was gonna happen to me, I'd have laughed in your face.

So we go for a walk then go to a restaurant and it was fun and she was interesting. At the end of the date I was just like screw it, YOLO. And asked her if she would like a kiss. She just went for it; put her hands on my chest and just like open mouth kissed me right on the lips. It was amazing. That's as far as it went that day, and she lives in a different city so who knows if it will go further but I think there's a decent chance. We seem really compatible personality-wise, but I digress. It's not sex, but kissing is definitely a form intimacy, not so different from cuddling. Just the touch of someone who wants you physically is incredible. I've still technically never had sex, but that feeling of never being intimately connected to someone was what being FA was to me (if you pay an escort for sex you're still FA). After that experience I just don't feel that pit of despair and hopelessness, that I'm sure many of you here know all to well, anymore. Being FA can't really be described in a technical way, it's an internalized feeling and I'm finally free of it. I finally feel human, finally alive. People in relationships or normal people or whatever say that intimacy is no big deal, but I cannot overstate how much this has changed my outlook on life. As with all things in life this was all luck and it would be ridiculous to suggest otherwise. But it feels like I've escaped some sort of cage and my life can finally begin. I'm honestly torn over leaving, because I want to stay here and try to help people to go from how I felt before to now. But I don't really know how I could help, besides saying don't give up. I'm sorry if this post sounds like bragging. It's not, it's just that I wanted to share this here because anyone else would think I'm nuts for making such a big deal over something that's such a mundane part of life for normal people.",

I know how hard it is to find someone, especially when you think you never will. \nMy gf (18) and I (22)have been dating for almost 6 months now. I met her online and she lived about 10 hours away from me. I finally nut up the courage, told my parents I was going to meet someone I met online, and went and met her. I could only stay for one night, but that was the happiest night of my life. When I first met her IRL we had been dating for almost 3 months. So it was nice to know she was real lol. But she’s never been a social butterfly and kept to herself. Well she recently started college about halfway in between her home and I. Ofc, she met a guy that she thought was being friendly and me being a dude, automatically saw him as a threat. Well, I’m not there and they went and saw a guest speaker and he was there. My gf dressed up and looked stunning ofc. He showed up and my gf and her two friends sat with him. After they went and ate. After coming back to her dorm, he texted her and they were talking while I was on the phone with her. He said she looked cute tonight and she immediately told him she was taken. Which, I’ve never doubted her loyalty, but that made all of my anxiety and insecurities subside immediately, because she turned someone down… FOR ME!! Every other pseudo relationship I’ve been in, it’s never been like that. They always left for someone else. Then he went on to say the compliment still stands and that rubbed me the wrong way, but! I never thought I would be here in this situation. It takes time, it takes effort, it takes compromise, but you can find someone. There’s 7 billion people in the world. Someone will love you. Someone will care for you… maybe you won’t get to see them in person all the time, or get to touch them, or have sex with them whenever you want. But we know it’s not all about the sex and touching. We just want to be loved. You can be loved.",

I'll get you the dish again.\" I said hey it's fine, it for sure looked heavy. You don't have to be sorry at all. She seemed around my age/maybe a bit older. The manager rushed and told me they will make that dish and was angry at the poor girl, I said it was just a human mistake. I'm totally fine and he didn't have to worry that much. She looked at me and smiled, went to another table. I wish I had told her how good she was, I kind of developed a crush lol.

A couple of weeks ago they hired a new person, so, this was they first time that we were going to meet her. I only talked with her about work stuff and nothing else, so , I knew barely anything about her.\n\nSo, the day arrived, and I saw her, and I was astonished, she was pretty beautiful and tall (about half inch shorter than me), also, she resulted to be very shy, but friendly, after other coworkers started to talk with her. I didn't wanted to say anything to her because I didn't felt comfortable with it and I didn't wanted to bother her, so I kept doing my own stuff until the end of the day.\n\nNear the end of the day, everyone was talking about where they were going to go after work, I said that I was to going home since I had to take care of my dog, then my boss asked me about where I lived, I answered and she said that she lives near me, I was surprised, but I didn't wanted to elaborate on it, so I returned to my work.\n\nWhen I was about to leave, she asked me about how I was going to return to home, I told her that I was going to take the subway, and she offered me to go together, since we had to take the same subway line and she was going to get off an station earlier than me. I freaked out, but I accepted, so, we walk together to the station.\n\nSince it was a bit far from the office, we walked for a while, and we talked about several things, she was shy (so I was) but we managed to have a good time on our way home, time went fast. I feel weird, because it resulted that we have several things in common, so, we talked a lot about that. We arrived to the station where she had to get off, so, we said good bye and she thanked me for go along with her on her way to the station, I followed my own way afterwards.\n\nI don't know what to say or what to feel about this, I obviously see her in a platonic way since I don't wanna ruin anything or over compromise anything that could be hurtful both in a personal and professional way, but, I can say that I had a good day. It's the first time that I felt great about a day of work.\n\nObviously, I don't want this post to be like a brag about it, since I wouldn't consider this as a success (i tagged as it because Reddit wouldn't let me post without a flair), since I'm still alone, after work I don't have anything to talk or anyone to rely except my dog, but, at least I can say that someone that's not from my family enjoyed their time with me :)",

Workplace romance is a thing and even though he was the dorkiest dude in the room, I still ended up falling for him because he didn't make our relationship or conversations feel forced.

It's easy to constantly compare and think you fall short without realizing that so many of those people don't show the mistakes and flaws. The failures and pitfalls, etc. It also makes for a much more compelling story to talk about someone that is exceptionally and stood out versus the average Joe. It doesn't mean they don't exist. Instagram is especially bad with that with its own term now, \"Instagram reality.\" Being aware and knowing how to distinguish that from reality is a very powerful tool for your life. Social media is only going to get bigger and I don't think it's possible to continually ignore it unless you want to be a hermit. Communication is part of the human condition and for better or for worse, social media is a powerful driver in that sense.",

We are more than FA\n\n\n (feeling kind of positive (???) rn, I’m usually much more depressed and negative,  it’ll be back to venting and crying in an hour or two)",

I have some things to write down here and maybe yall can help me understand what's happening here.  \n\n\nSo I'm overweight. Not TLC 600-pound-life, but I'm big. New Year's resolution was to lose weight. At the beginning of January I started talking to a girl long-distance who also was losing weight. We became very close and talked every day. I have real life friends too, but she and I were close. During this 4 month period, **I lost 33 pounds.** That relationship crashed and burned, (she was cruel) and I fell off the wagon.   \n\n\nSince then I struggled. Obviously I am lonely and suddenly I had a severe lack of attention since I had nobody to talk to 24/7 the way we did for months. I gave up and regained 12 pounds. Well, after my long-distance friend and I ceased contact, I met a woman at a bar completely at random. She was drunk and said hello to me and we exchanged numbers. We're strictly friends and have no intention of dating, but we are both single and we have both been that way for a long time.   \n\n\nAfter we'd been friends for a while she subtly suggested that she wanted to cuddle with someone. I volunteered and had her over to watch a movie. Ever since then, I have her over a few times a month and we cuddle and watch movies/netflix. Nothing extra has developed, we are strictly friends.  \n\n\nBut I've noticed something pretty weird. I'm less sad... I've gotten back to my caloric restriction plan and it's much easier to stick to. I'm back to losing weight, and my mood and confidence is overall improved. I am still lonely, but recently the sharp edge has been blunted.   \n\n\nJust having regular physical contact is changing my life for the better. Can anyone else relate to this?",

                "text_body": "So I come to count you my two... semi-success stories, if we can call them this. It have been months since I wanted to tell the first one, for some reason I am only telling it now. The second has happened some weeks ago, although I don't know if I could call it (or the first one for that matters) success stories.\n\nThe first one took place during the night between January the 1st and January the 2nd (the latter is my birthday, just before I hit 30, perhaps that's why I dind't get my wizard powers). A new friend of mine invited me to a party at her house, for an \"second New Year's Eve\" party. I remember many of drank a lot early in the party. Then a hole in memories. Then I remember a woman in my arms. While I was sitting on a couch, she was sitting on my knees. We were cuddling each other. Caressing each other arms and hands. We even kissed, sometimes with the tongue. Although I didn't thought about being so intimate with her at first, I was so happy to kiss and cuddle her in my arms. I even cried with the host of the party (I was still pretty drunk, remember), and then in the sleeping bag at the time of sleeping there. These were hardly tears of sadness, but mostly tears of joy, tears of having lived  a wonderful moment and sharing such tenderness. Having succeeded to have something I wanted for so many years.\n\nThen I learned that she actually kissed lots of people when drunk for a moment, but that I was the one who kept her the longest in my arms during this time. I also learnt that it was actually a friend of mine who pushed me in her arms during that moment. Despite all of this, I remember this moment  fondly, this was my first kiss outside of a bottle game very long ago, the first one with the tongue, and I want to relive such a moment of tenderness so much, if possible with reciprocity with a sober woman.\n\nThen, during the months that followed, I haven't been able to relive such a wonderful moment with a woman. I almost went back to my former FA self, but with that one memory. \n\nThen three weeks ago, I was with friends in a bar, after playing board games together. At one point, another woman (who I talked a bit some nights before, and a very little bit during that night, and who was single since recently) asked me if she could lay her head on my shoulder. I said yes, and she did laid her head on my shoulder for a little while. For this time, she and I were quite sober, but since I have trouble with noise in bars, and because I am shy as fuck during these kind of moments, I wasn't able to talk that much more to her or to go further than this moment, and I regret so much not asking her number after that, because I haven't met her since. I regret not asking for her number so much, I would have loved to keep contact with her. \n\nSo yeah, I don't know if I would give this post a rant or a success story flair. Objectively, I have a better situation than before this year: now I own my own apartment, a new social circle, my bass skills improved, I go outside more... But I still haven't found an actual girlfriend and want one so much, I want to relive these moments of tenderness so much. But will I even succeed soon, despite my autism, my shit way of talking (too fast, like I was on apne), and much more? Moments line the ones I described above gove me hope, but I'd really like to find someone who actually love me and with who I could share affection and complicity together, as lovers. Will I even meet her soon, or even one day?\n\nPerhaps telling these (semi-)success stories is a way for me to reassure myself, or telling me I may be worthwile to have a girlfriend. But I want to go so much more further than what happened in these stories.",

And all I had to do was turn into a femboy. I know that sounds weird. And it's still quite absurd to even think about it. Anyway, I had this weird dream of me being a femboy. So I was like: Why the hell not? Either I like it or I do not. And in the end I did like it. It gave me a confidence boost somehow. I had the silly idea to create a twitter account to post pictures of me. At this point I knew that I will probably attract boys in some way. Even though I prefer girls. But chances of me finding someone were already zero. So it could only higher my chances. And then it happened: People actually liked my pics. I gained in not even 3 weeks over 220 followers. This made me so happy. The first time in my life people are noticing me. \n\nSo there was this guy. He sent me a DM. And told me that I looked cute. We talked a bit and he told me that he was about to visit his old home not far from me. And asked if we could meet. I was flattered. And said yes. Not even one week passed of me knowing this guy. It was kinda stupid in hindsight but I thought I wouldn't get another chance. He told me wants to snuggle and such but I told him that I can't get into a relationship with boys. He told me it wasn't his intention in the first place he just wants to cuddle. Well and then we met and it was beautiful. I finally didn't have the feel of me being worthless. I felt loved. And let's just say there was more more then just cuddles...\n\nWell I hope I never have to come back. Good luck to you guys and goodbye! \n\nTLDR: Turned into a femboy and escaped this hellhole",

                "text_body": "I used to lurk here for quite a bit but never posted. I'm officially dating someone for the first time as a 22 year old. She's gorgeous, sweet, adorable, and most importantly actually likes me back and wants to be with me. I wanted to share my story and the things that worked out for me.\n\nI was out of shape and ugly back in highschool and most of college, extremely antisocial and in general a stereotypical nerdy Asian engineering student. I did have a few short long-distance relationships mostly online but I wouldn't count those as real relationships, and besides, they were mostly toxic. When the pandemic hit and I was extremely isolated, which really made me want to find someone. Here are a few of the things that worked out for me. \n\nI started with improving my looks. I worked out like crazy while in lockdown and also started to learn to dress better, take better care of my skin, work on my hairstyle, etc. I wouldn't say I'm particularly good looking but I'd say I look like an average guy now. \n\nI also started to force myself to be more sociable and put myself in situations where I'd have to socialize. This wasn't easy during the height of the pandemic but became easier once I graduated college and moved onto grad school. I think learning to pick up on subtle social cues that helps you carry an interesting conversation helped me out immensely. I also changed the way I speak, both my voice and my accent, to make myself sound less annoying, at least to my ears. \n\nAll those changes, both physical and social, helped me become more confident in social situations. It gave me enough self-confidence to download dating apps for the first time, because before then, I was always way too afraid of rejection to even try out dating apps. I downloaded Bumble, Tinder, and Hinge, took some nice non-selfie pictures, and came up with some creative prompts and bio. I initially got next to no matches (especially because I'm living in a relatively \"redneck\" part of the country while I'm an Asian PhD student in engineering) and it took me several tries with pictures and bios to get more matches consistently (I'm really proud of the bio I wrote up actually, vast majority of girls I match with mention how they swiped right on me because they found my bio funny and creative). \n\nIt took me a full year of using these apps to finally find the right person. Initially I had trouble carrying the conversation, finding the right time to ask for a date, and just keeping the match interested in general. But eventually I figured out the right things to share about myself, what kinds of jokes to make, etc. It took a lot of effort but I did manage to go on several dates, which were awkward at first but gave me more confidence and skills needed to get more matches, like a positive feedback cycle. \n\nEventually I met my girlfriend on Hinge. Like me, she's never had a relationship, which came as a surprise to me because she's absolutely gorgeous (she works as a model), and honestly I couldn't believe she was even considering me. She wanted to take things slowly and I did. I got her number and we texted and called for several weeks before she agreed to a first date. That led to a second date, then a third date, and the fourth. I really liked her, since she understood me and made me feel at ease talking to her, like I didn't need to put up a fake confident persona with her. I asked her out after the fourth date and she said yes, so I officially have a girlfriend now. \n\nOne thing I noticed in my journey of changing myself is that initially, when I barely got any attention from girls and saw myself as ugly, I tended to mess up even the few opportunities I had because of my insecurities. In that situation, when I literally had one potential girl interested in me while she might have dozens of other guys, I felt insecure and that made me act desperate and eventually scared girls away. Once I became more confident and started to get multiple matches on dating apps, I could feel myself becoming more natural and less desperate. \n\nBy a combination of desperate efforts and massive stroke of good fortune, I found a girlfriend for the first time and I can confidently say that I feel happier now. I understand that self-improvement isn't the answer for everyone, but at least for me, it gave me the confidence I needed to pull myself out of the pit. I wish everyone reading this the same amazing luck that I had.",

I tried to answer them using details about my life but also make it funny. It's kinda hard to explain exactly how to write a creative bio, but it took me a few iterations to get it right. I also looked at a lot of examples of creative bios. Like for example, one prompt I chose on Bumble was \"the quickest way to your heart is...\" and I answered it somewhere along the lines of \"using 900N of force between my 3rd and 4th rib\" and I cited an academic paper that reported on that. It made sense since I'm a graduate student so stuff like that shows who I am. Best of luck to your OLD experience!",

Guess what, when I had no success in the dating world at all, I became desperate and was way more likely to mess up. Once I started to have more successes in meeting girls, I became less desperate and more relaxed which led to more successes.

Asked out everyone I could to high school prom (and got rejected by everyone).\n\n2. Joined university student clubs (running club, anime club, juggling/unicycling club).\n\n3. Went out drinking at college parties and later nightclubs.\n\n4. Got myself on Tinder, Bumble, Facebook Dating (it's like Tinder but it's in the Facebook app and it's 100% free), Match, Plenty of Fish, OkCupid, Coffee Meets Bagel, and Hinge. Swiped right on everyone and messaged \"Hey, how's it going?\" to every match.\n\n5. Went to events on Meetup.com almost every evening after work.\n\n6. Joined local clubs and went to group yoga and acroyoga classes. My city has a running club so I joined that too.\n\n7. Met people on Reddit by posting personal ads on r/r4r, r/MakeNewFriendsHere, r/NeedAFriend, and r/MeetPeople. Sorted posts on those subreddits by \"new\", messaged new posters, and had conversations with them. Note that a lot of these subreddits are for platonic friendship only but sometimes platonic friendship eventually develops into a relationship so can't hurt as long as you're not sexual.\n\n8. Posted publicly on social media and messaged people who liked my posts and followed me (warning: there are a lot of bots, scammers, and fake accounts on public social media. Do not click any links and watch out for people who try to build a relationship with you then ask for money or ask for you to \"invest\" in something like crypto).\n\nBeen doing these things over the last 10 years and still don't have a girlfriend, but today I videochatted with a girl for 2 hours and yesterday we talked on the phone for 2 hours as well, so hopefully that works out. Honestly, it worked out so funny with her. I got sick of messaging \"Hey, how's it going?\" and that obviously wasn't working, so I just spewed my personal issues and problems at all my matches (copy-paste style) and she felt compelled to reply, gave me her number, and asked me to call her, and we ended up on the phone for 2 hours. Other people were like \"Why are you telling me this shit, I'm a total stranger?\" but not her. You never know what will work, lol.\n\nUpdate: On Saturday, January 11th she stopped replying to me (even though she read my messages). Well, guess I'm dying alone, haha.",

Moreover, someone very close to me had wronged me. So I decided that instead of pitying myself, instead of constantly whining about my sad, little, pathetic life, I decided to channel all the hatred I had for myself and others into something productive. \n\nI decided enough was enough. I decided I wasn't going to be the person to drag myself down. I wasn't going to be the person who loathed himself or had no pride for himself. You see, because of the circumstances, I had forgotten who I was, who I could be.\n\nSo I set out to change myself radically. I have a ton of mental and physical problems. I started from there. I was very unhealthy as an individual and got diagnosed with diabetes at the ripe young age of 21. I fixed my diet and started exercising. I started therapy and followed through religiously. I fixed my eating and sleeping schedule. I started pushing myself out of my comfort zone. This meant being ready for rejection, from girls and from people who I only wanted to be friends with. I started studying regularly for my entrance exams.\n\nAnd all of it worked tbh. I lost a ton of weight, I inculcated healthy eating habits, my mental health improved, my physical health improved, I was off all medication, I became fitter and more confident. I made new friends, I met new people, my overall mood improved. I went from wanting to kill myself daily to actually looking forward to my day. \n\nI think the most important change was actually wanting to change for myself and not for anyone else. It seems most of us have forgotten our pride, our drive. I learned to care for myself. And yes, I know it is hard when nobody wants to care or love for you. But for guys like us, it's never going to be easy. So pick yourselves up, dust yourself off, and start soldiering through. It's only you for you no one else.",

We texted a bit, super low effort texting just morning and how's your day and goods lmao.

Outside of a Tinder match in 20\\`15, I've only been on two other dates- both were blind dates and went nowhere.\n\nI think one of the biggest hurdles I've faced in my dating life has been my disability. I have mild Cerebral Palsy. I work, drive, and live independently, but I believe women see me limp around the place and immediately assume weakness. I'm often spoken to in a pitying or condescending manner, and one woman who did seriously consider me was full of logistical questions of how well I could have sex. Seeing as I could count the number of sexual encounters I've had on one hand as a man in his early 30s... the interest went away quickly.\n\nFast-forward to last weekend. I was travelling inter-state (1.5 hour flight from Sydney to Melbourne). I made a friend online who also has CP (34F) and we've said for a long time that we should go on a date if I was ever in town. So we had dinner, and good conversation. Whether it was still a date was a bit in question on my end- the talk was friendly and focused on similarities in both our condition and our jobs, but it wasn't overtly flirty. And she insisted on splitting the bill, which I thought was a bad sign. But after dinner, we started to flirt and be a bit more touchy, and I wound up kissing her goodbye in a really nice, romantic moment.\n\nIt was wonderful, but I don't know if it goes beyond a bit of fun. I had to save for a couple of months to afford to go to her, and while she said she was keen to come up to see me next time, how viable would a relationship be if we only saw each other once every couple of months?\n\nJust wanted to share it as a 31 year old guy, who has a physical disability and lives a very lonely life day-to-day, found a little light at the end of the tunnel.",

That gives me like 14-16 hours of time I'm not eating or snacking or anything. After a few days, you stop being hungry in the mornings. I extended it out to 18 hours a day (I don't always do it every day)  \n\n\nOnce you kinda get used to delaying eating, it gets easier. The mental trick I used for myself is not to \"deny\" myself anything. No telling myself, \"nope, I can't have that\"  \n\n\nI instead tell myself \"just wait until 1pm, and I'll have that!\" and it works pretty well. I don't usually keep snacks in the house, or any food that doesn't require heating or cooking. If I do, it's in the cupboard downstairs and not readily accessible. \"Out of sight, out of mind\" also works for me.  \n\n\nTL;DR, it will be hard for the first week or two, but tell yourself its only for a week or two. But by the time you get to the end, it'll be easy to delay your eating. The more time per day I spend NOT eating, the less I end up eating in total.",

When I first joined I was lonely and to be honest miserable. I went through highschool an awakward skinny mess that barely had male friends, let alone a girl. I was, and still am to a degree, extremly shy, awkward, needy for attention and desperate for validation (especially from girls). I spent my whole day online trying to escape the misery that was my life.\n\nI dont know what got me to change, but I can tell you the biggest catalyst that led me to improving my life was joining a martial arts/boxing gym. I was a skinny, weak, socially awkward and unorganised when I started. The biggest change was the injection of dicipline. All of a sudden I had to be at the gym at a certain time. I had to start fixing my sleep schedule to wake up on time to reach for the morning training sessions. \n\nI also was interacting with people alot more, as awkward and shy as I was, I was forced to talk to guys I was training with. I still never hung out afterwards, but I was learning the basics of banter and socialising for the 1 or 2 hrs  a day I was there.\n\nI got into somewhat decent shape, i gained some muscle, which I have maintained. The main thing wasnt the improvement in apearance, which tbh was not much 😅, it was the increase in strength. Feeling stronger had a positive outcome on my mentaility and how I felt. I wasnt as unconfident or scared of social interactions, still awakward af tho lol.\n\nI also left my dead end shitty job, it was hard, and still is. Plenty of 60+hr work weeks ontop of studying for certifications to jump careers but it payed off. Im nowhere near rich but finally broke into that lower middleclass (~50k a yr). Ik, it isnt much and tbh in todays economy is still low, but its way better than busting my ass off for min wage. Hopefully over the urs I can progress further.\n\nAnother thing I learned was basic hygiene lol, clipping my nails, washing my hair, wearing deodrant, showering daily. tbh I learnt all that afyer getting roasted at work and thd gym for being a smelly bastard. \n\nI found a girl too, shes nice and caring. I was awkward and stuttery when I first met her, but I pushed through and eventually asked her out. I got hella rejections before I met her even afyer I got my shit together, so tbh I do feel theres a lot of luck and chance, but I guess by improving myself I improved my chances?\n\nngl, this post was sort of a humblebrag, but I just had to share. idk why, maybe deep down I still need the validation, but its been a long road, and theres a longer road ahead.\n\nIf my skinny awkward short ass can get my life to the point is fucking liveable and the misery isnt overwhelming, I truly believe alot of you guys can as well. \n\nIm gonna stay online here from time to time to try to help out the community Ive been a part of for so long.\n\nLove all you ugly (like me) bastards 💚",

I dont know if thatll work for you, my belief is that each person responds differently. One thing that helped me visualise quitting was literally writing out hrs spent playing video games vs hours earning money vs hours working out. I turned it into a competition where I wanted to increase the hours working out and earning money compared to gaming or being online. Im not kidding when I began my videogame hrs where at 40, gym was like 3 and working was like 15. A week later it was working 40, gym 5 and video games were way down. If I made a week where video games were lower than my working or excircising hrs I gave myself a treat, usually some sugary food lol. \n\nidk if that helps but it worked for me. Seriously bro idk you or anything about you, but I really hope you achieve what youre setting out for  because I know for a fact you can do it if I did it.",

Now I have met a woman who actually likes me and we have started dating. I just spent the night with her tonight. I honestly don't know why she likes me but she does.\n\nIirc this sub does not like advice. I'm just going to say, it can happen. And the way for it is, imo, be social. Find some kind of place where people meet. Force yourself to go there. Force yourself to say shit even if you think it's boring. Eventually you will find a woman who likes you for some reason. You don't need to be charismatic or extroverted or anything. I honestly don't think you need to do self improvement, beyond getting through anxiety enough to put yourself in front of people.\n\nAlso, it is a million times better than I could imagine. I honestly wish all of you will get to experience this.\n\nSo long, boys and girls.",

Even if you just re-watched some of your favourite shows and movies and had a blast? \n\nTL;DR: Long Text Story. \n\nI’ll tell you my story. \n\nI’ve always felt disconnected with people growing up. Even my own parents nearly always felt alien to me. No matter how hard I tried to make friends or talk to people and understand them I could never shake the gut feeling of not getting anywhere. Everything I did outside felt fake and irrelevant. Like it was really all completely pointless. \n\nThen came the depression. At the worst time of all, in the years leading to my finals in secondary school. I never struggled in education up until that point because I essentially had no distractions. I was a pretty smart kid. The last few years felt like the biggest challenge of my life even without what I had going on at the time. 3 years of trying to stay on-top of 8 subjects while fighting your own mind was the worst experience ever, I wouldn’t even wish it on people I despise. \n\nI stopped studying, stopped eating properly, got picked on at school, slept 14-ish hours a day, grades fell, skipped school more and more often, even attempted suicide several times because I was failing at the most important time of my life. \n\nI suffered all that time until exams came. And I got what I needed, just not what I wanted. Even now, after all that, I feel I lost more of myself than what it was worth. \n\nThen I managed turn it around, somehow. Now I have a great job in Healthcare, saving and healing as best I can. Not the best job for someone who doesn’t talk much but it’s I guess it’s a small price to pay. \n\nI may be forever alone and feel forever disconnected and on the outside, but we take what small wins we can get elsewhere.",

                "text_body": "Hi folks\n\nI wanna tell a story and even though it didn't work out I still marked it as success because I hope it will spark some hope in you and inspire you to - not fix - but prepare for if you meet your someone someday.\n\nI (F26) met my ex (M29) three years ago on Tinder. Perhaps I should feel bad for classifying him as a loner, but in my opinion there's really nothing to feel bad about. Being a virgin without friends shouldn't make you less entitled to respect, kindness and love. And when I found this sub the other day and read your stories it all reminded me of him.\n\n**About us**  \nMy ex had given up on finding someone before he met me. He is not conventionally beautiful, is balding, has a hunch, has four friends who treats him bad, has been depressed all his life, spends all his time in his dirty home alone, eats microwave food and cup noodles every day and bury himself in work to escape reality.\n\nI have a solid circle of friends, come from a nice home, has been in my fair share of relationships, looks good (I used to model before university) and I take good care of myself. Sometimes people ask me what I saw in him and honestly I really really liked him. I loved his dark humour, found him super attractive and learned a lot about pursuing your dreams, not depend on others and not give a damn about what other people think, which I'm still thankful for.\n\n**His trust issues**  \nBut in the end I couldn't do it anymore. He had been abandoned by everyone in his life so it was impossible to gain his trust. Even though I never let him down until the day I broke up with him he still never made room for me in his life. I dressed up nice for him, but he never complimented it as if he didn't know what to say. Being in a relationship requires you to be emotionally vulnerable and I constantly felt hurt whenever I did something for him and he tried to not lose face by ignoring it. He was often suspicious, but he had not worked on developing a language for expressing these feelings, so I had to patiently pull it out of him if I could sense something was off. Many men are raised with this mindset but it was particularly bad with him because he was so shy of conflict.\n\n**He wasn't 'prepared'**  \nHe has since told me that he didn't expect to ever live with someone before meeting me, so he had found it redundant to learn how to cook, clean and keep a house. These skills along with social skills felt unnecessary to gain with no prospect of ever getting a family. This meant that I had to teach him everything, which was super tiresome. He constantly switched between being too embarrassed to take my advice and trying to prove something by poorly hiding unwashed dishes from me and many other things. He would also disrespect my food and imply that what I did was so easy and unnecessary.\n\nIt ruined the dynamic because he had to manage his secrets and hide things constantly even though I didn't judge at that time. Also, we couldn't do everyday things like cooking together because he didn't want to lose face, even though I clearly knew what was going on. He was super afraid to lose me in case I saw who he really was, but I could read him easily, so it was just an absurd theater that both of us would've been better of without.\n\n**Untreated mental illness**  \nI don't want to diagnose him with anything, but he definitely had some mental things that growing up with careless and emotionally absent parents hadn't helped on. And he revealed to me at some point that he kept buying and testing different pills from germany to self-medicate. He didn't call it that, but to me it sounded alarming. He described having anxiety attacks (but refused to call it that) where he became unable to walk and speak when he was alone. He had discovered that he could stress himself to a degree where he could overcome his 'lazyness', which to me sounded more like an unhealthy way to cope with depression.\n\nThere was nothing I could do and I got more and more involved in it. I tried to read online about things he described, I tried to give him space, I tried to pick him up and say: now we're going out and now we do something you love to do like going to the spa, drink sweet drinks at a nice place or go see an action movie. We talked it through whenever he had had an episode at work or with a 'friend'.\n\n**Sex**  \nOur sexlife was nonexisting. I had to 'carry' it all the time, and the vulnerability issues were super present in bed. It was like fucking a doll. He wouldn't share what he liked, he never gave me any hints and if I shared what I liked he didn't do anything with the information, which made me feel pretty silly. He would constantly try to prove something in bed even though we both knew he was a virgin. I tried to make him take it slow, but his insecurities started to spill over into my cup. I'm not a superwoman with infinite amounts of self-worth.\n\n**I broke up**  \nAt some point I realised I wouldn't get any answers out of him. The last 6 months of our relationship I spent more time on google than actually talking to him about the relationship. At that point I had even discovered FemaleDatingStrategy, and even though much can be said about that sub the women over there helped me wake up and realize that the relationship was super doomed and I had to get out.\n\nThe day I broke up I told him I couldn't do it anymore. I felt like I was the only one who wanted it to work, I cried and he was completely silent and did not show any emotions when I told him.\n\n**Everything became more clear after breaking up**  \nBut a few days later emails started to tick in from him. He told me about a lot of things he had hid from me like his abusive parents, his bad financial situation, his dreams for a future with me. He told me about being lonely and how aware he was about everything but just tried to hide it. The mails were super long, like 15 pages or something, so I can't sum all of it up. He said he would do everything to get me back and that I was the only person who had ever believed in him and loved him. But I had promised myself to not take him back before he started to actually fix these things. \n\nWhen I called him one month later he admitted that he had realized how bad things were- He had contacted a therapist, but he had realized how hard it was for him to talk about his feelings. He had started to google his mental symptoms and started to read about it. He had realized how hard it was to learn to clean and cook from scratch etc. And all I could think was: *Why didn't you start working on these things before you met me?* But it kinda makes sense when you don't believe you'll ever meet someone. He felt foolish for dreaming about having his own family before meeting me, so he kinda protected himself by telling himself he just didn't want it. That it was unnecessary. But it was exactly this mindset that ruined it and not the things he believed would ruin it: his looks, his loneliness, him being a virgin, feeling insecure, feeling like a loser etc.\n\nWe speak regularly, and I have no interest in being with him ever again due to all the times he let me down. I don't trust him because of all the secrets he kept poorly and I'm afraid I would stagnate his progress if I ever took him back. But he still loves me and ... yeah. \n\nI tried and I learned a lot from it. But things could've been different if he hadn't given up before meeting me. But it must feel so painful to dream about a better future when you find it impossible to actually believe it's ever going to happen for you. If my life had been like his I'm not sure I would've made it that far. ",

That burden doesn't lie with you and you really are not helping him you're likely making it worse.. \n\nI've learnt that fully cutting ties with someone is the best way to get over them.. You aren't letting him do that or for yourself.. \n\n\nThe teaching him to do things maybe he found that was the only way to connect with you and in learning looses that so doesn't try to learn..\n\nIt takes two people to make a relationship and two people to fuck it up",

We’ve only hung out for weeks and had a few sleepovers but I can honestly say I’ve never been this happy in my entire life before. She was actually my first!

We talk all day from morning till 5 AM the next day in most cases. I remember when we video called the other day and honestly, I’ve never seen someone stare at me with such an affectionate gaze. I’ve never really found someone that accepts me for me, you know? I still question it time to time, she knows of this, and she reassures me that she does like me no matter how many times I second guess her. I’m supposed to move back to school at the end of the month, that’s when we’ll most likely see each other again. Till then is when I’ll most likely post an update\n\nUPDATE: she came over to my place and everyone home really liked her! I also asked her to be my girlfriend and she said yes!",

                "text_body": "Hi FA, I [22M] am an ex-lurker (approximately 3-1.5 years ago if I recall correctly) of this subreddit and recently felt the need to share my story here for whoever would like to hear it, or whoever needs to hear it, really. Although my personal experience is focussed around the lack of love and intimacy I experienced backed then, I invite all of you open-minded FA'ers to give this a read. \n\nI'll start off by saying this: I have lurked here again for some days after deleting Reddit approximately 18 months ago and was reminded of the mindset I was in back when I was browsing this subreddit. Cynism, pessimism and generally dark thoughts. I had completely forgotten what it was like and honestly: it feels like it's been ages since then, like it was all some sort of dream. \n\nNow before I continue: if you're 100.0% convinced you're remaining alone forever and simply use this subreddit to vent: that's okay (well it's not, but I can't stop you), but nothing I write here will resonate with you, so you're probably better off downvoting this and saving yourself the time and effort. If however your mind is still open a crack, and you are simply desperate (like I was back then) for some advise, wisdom or comforting words, you may want to read this. \n\nThe truth is that many of you have endured loneliness far worse than mine. I was fortunate enough to have had very good friends and loving family my entire life. And I also know that plenty of you are older than I am, and have endured the burden for much longer than I have. And I mean it when I say that you have all the right to be angry, disappointed, sad, frustrated, scared, and whatever else you might feel. I certainly know I felt all of those up until just over a year ago (even with all my privileges), but they were part of the problem.\n\nLet's go a little more than 3 years back in time to when I was 19. I'd had 2 first dates up until that point; no romantic click, just lousy first dates (I think one may not have even realized I considered it a first date LOL). Besides that I'd had never kissed a girl, been in a relationship and definitely not had sex before. I was fed up, more distracted than ever and deeply frustrated, and felt like I was only falling deeper and deeper in this pit of inexperience as I was getting older and started seeing my friends and peers all experience these things. \n\nThe harsh truth in retrospect? I see why I had no success. I was insecure, I myself didn't even like the way I looked, I was really skinny, I had pretty bad acne and looked really young for my age. I also didn't like the way I dressed. My entire closet basically consisted of clothes my mom had bought me quite some years ago, which all still fitted me. I was really self-conscious about all these things. \n\nBack then I didn't see it like that though. I thought I was at the very least kind, quite funny, pretty intelligent and reasonably talkative to new people when I really tried - that should be enough right? \"There are so many women with asshole boyfriends who treat them like shit, so why can't I find anyone?\" was what I thought to myself day after day. And even then I realized that although I was probably far from attractive, there were plenty of ugly guys with little to offer in relationships with decent looking girls. \n\nNear the end of 2018 I was peaking on all fronts: frustration, desperation, fear, but also motivation and determination. Somewhere in December, I decided that my New Year's resolution for 2019 was going to be (the unavoidable) self-improvement (phase), starting with me fanatically going to the gym to lift weights - something I'd never done before. Yeah yeah, I've seen that \"lifting showers\" meme multiple times already in the past days, but if you really think there is nothing to it, you really don't get it yet.\n\nAnyways, as with all New Year's resolutions, I realized the odds were stacked against me and I'd likely quit at some point. But since this was not about me trying to lose a few pounds or live a healthier lifestyle (like most NY resolutions), but instead me actually fearing that I would not manage to ever experience intimacy, I managed to sustain a transition from no sports to a 6 days/week workout routine indefinitely with only few missed workouts. \n\nThose first days and weeks were absolute pain, both mentally AND physically, but mostly mentally. Entering a gym alone and seeing mostly well-built men lifting heavy weights made experimenting with exercises I had never done a daunting task. In retrospect this was just one of the many sides of my insecurity and self-consciousness. And the reality is that most men you see in that cheapest nearby gym have absolutely no clue what they're doing, but it's going to take you some time to see that if you don't already. \n\nThere were days I had to be in the gym by 7:15 AM to be able to fit the workout in my schedule, and there were days I'd literally not be able to raise an arm to shoulder height without experiencing some of the most excruciating muscle soreness I have ever experienced. Was I going overboard? Yes. Was all of this really functional? I don't know, but it's hard not to appreciate the results when you poured that much time, pain and effort into it. \n\nAnd the results did come in. About two months in, I'd already put on a good few kilos of weight and the progress was already more than visible. I was ecstatic, really. Confidence +1. From there on I quickly realized I had to start eating more if I wanted to keep progressing, and I did. The eating was even more challenging than the training routine initially, but I managed. Three years fast forward, I'm still going to the gym 5-6 times a week and have grown to love it. \n\nDoes it get you a girlfriend? No lol, if that were the case, we could probably close down this subreddit. The point however is that if you actually start progressing towards your dream physique, you start looking at yourself differently, you start feeling differently, and your confidence grows - even if it's just a little. And that's what it's about really: anything you dislike about yourself that can be changed will boost your confidence once you change it. \n\nAnd although I did feel a slight boost in confidence, I was still incredibly desperate and insecure in general. While maintaining my workout schedule, I became obsessed with dating & hookup apps, subreddits and websites. I was using my daily swipes on countless of apps and bumped both my subreddit and other online posts as often as I could. As we have all experienced, I had no success for consecutive months. Just a handful of conversations across a number of different platforms from many, many swipes and posts. \n\nAt the end of May 2019, a cute Chinese girl my age living only 80 km away from me reached out to me in response to a forum post I placed on an online hookup forum. The post I wrote pretty much described my situation as it was: average looking virgin guy looking for a girl to gain some experience with (and some bathroom selfies with perfect lighting in which I looked pretty ripped after 5 months of diehard gym routine). \n\nWe talked for some days over whatsapp as I was away on vacation at the time the reached out and hit it off. We finally agreed to meet up, and I booked us a hotel room as we still both lived at home. We met up at a train station in case either one of us was catfishing, but were both pleasantly surprised with who we found there. We travelled to the hotel together, and even in the hotel room first talked for like 2-3 hours before getting down to business.\n\nShe had brought along a bottle of wine that we were sharing to calm our nerves, and the nicest part out of it all (including the incredibly bad sex we'd have later on) was that she at some point told me she was surprised that I had never been with a girl before. Again: confidence +1. At some point we were both looking to transition to action, so I suggested to give her a massage - a good way to break the barrier of touch before going any further. \n\nAs calculated, the massage led to kissing, kissing led to oral and oral eventually led to sex: all of them in terrible performance. Being as nervous as I was with 2/3 bottle of wine down my throat (yes, alcohol was not a smart move in retrospect), I had an insane amount of trouble getting and staying hard. At the time this was a huge mental setback. Being horny 247 was one of the few things I could rely on in my life, and even that was letting me down when I truly needed it. \n\nAnyways, as I was apologizing and emphasizing that she wasn't the problem (she was quite attractive), she kept telling me it was okay. We cuddled a bit and spent the night together (also a first: confidence +1), and unfortunately I didn't try again next morning when I woke up early (didn't want to wake her up for it, and didn't know if she would appreciate it), because when she was finally up and rushing to get to work, she asked me why I didn't try again when I was up as early as I was. \n\nNevertheless, I was still thrilled: the impossible had happened, and eventhough it sucked, there was so much hope in the air. I walked her to her bus stop and we said our goodbyes. I ended up asking over whatsapp whether she wanted to try this again some time, but she kindly declined. I guess she realized she wasn't getting much out of it, and seeing a guy fail miserably in bed is kind of a turn-off. But none of that mattered. I had broken the vicious cycle, and knew that if I could do it once, I could do it again. \n\nIn that same year, October 2019, I already felt better than ever. I'd gained close to 15 kilos probably - a good mix of fat, muscle and water. Yet I felt like I was stalling again in my self-improvement progress - lifting was just not cutting it anymore. So I started looking for other things to work on. \n\nI started with something easy: my hair. I was used to this haircut which was really doing me no favours now that I look at pictures from back then (it's always evident in retrospect), and had been hinted before by friends that I should try something else for a change. \n\nSo I went to the hairdresser and simply said how I usually had my hair done, but that I wanted something else for a change. I think she just proposed something else and I told her to go for it. Something as simple as a new haircut already got me a couple compliments and made me feel good about myself. Confidence +1. \n\nA month later, November 2019, I started shopping around for a new outfit on my own (easier when you're financially in a good position, I know). First a new coat - a woolen coat, more chique and mature than what I'd usually wear. I must've went through hundreds of coats on a dozen different websites. Not because none of the others were good enough, but because I had to find a coat out of my comfort zone that I'd actually feel comfortable in - if that makes any sense. \n\nI'm glad my sense of taste didn't screw me over completely, because I actually received some compliments wearing that coat. Confidence +1. And that coat was probably just a mental step more than anything. After that I started switching out my old clothes and shoes over time for some (really cheap yet) more stylish & mature outfits. \n\nIn that same month I started working a new job that was suggested to me by a female friend, some basic administration at a small office. My co-workers were mostly women, most of which also still studying or recently finished. I'd like to say that wasn't part of the reason, but I'd be lying - even that friend used it as an argument to be fair. I was actually surprised how much I enjoyed working there.\n\nI still looked really young, and most co-workers had a couple years on me, so nothing really happened. But I managed to have a great time with pretty much anybody I worked with - men AND women, and I'm sure most of them felt the same. Getting comfortable in a female-dominated environment actually helped boost my confidence as well: confidence +1 \n\nDecember 2019 I went to a dermatologist to get a prescription for medication against my acne. I had actually gone to my GP several times in the months before that, but it had been a huge waste of time (don't let your GP talk you into ointments or antibiotics, that rarely has any lasting impact). The dermatologist prescribed me isotretinoin, a derivative of vitamin A that I had to take every day for close to a year. \n\nMy skin and specifically my lips were dehydrated for close to a year taking that medication, but surprisingly it actually worked. As people noticed, I got some compliments here and there again, and this actually meant very much to me. I was very self-conscious about my acne, and getting rid of it was an incredible relief. \n\nIn that same month I signed up for a salsa dancing beginners course (can highly recommend!) together with a friend. We were desperate for some action, so a salsa beginners course seemed like a perfect way to meet some new girls and improve our game and confidence. So we signed up at a student-focussed dance school and ended up being placed in a perfectly mixed group of both men and women - mostly our age. \n\nNeither of us had any real talent por la salsa, but that didn't matter. We always arrived a good 15 minutes before our lesson and pushed eachother to talk to whoever of the other girls in our class were already there and also waiting for class to start. We had an amazing time going there every week (making fun of eachother's incompetence), and that's something others and certainly women notice as well. If you manage to visibly have a good time by yourself or with a friend, you're already ahead of anybody else in that room. And eventhough again nothing really came from this either, our confidence grew tremendously: confidence +1. \n\nWhile the first moments during the first lesson were quite awkward and uncomfortable (although exciting as well), holding hands and being physically assertive (since the man leads in salsa) became more and more natural as the weeks passed. Confidence +1. And yeah, you get to dance with some pretty cute girls your age - can definitely recommend doing a course of something completely outside of your comfort zone if you're really desperate to meet some new people. \n\nLooking back I'm still proud of all that I got done within a single year (2019). 2020 made things more difficult again due to the pandemic. I went back onto the dating apps, but this time around with a more conventional approach. I had another date through Tinder after many weeks of endless swiping and tirelessly trying to entertain my matches to the point that they'd actually actively participate in any conversation. We had a great time sharing two bottles of wine and then failed to have sex when I again couldn't get hard (what idiot makes that same mistake twice? -_-). Managed to disappoint another woman though: confidence +1 \n\nAs a sidenote: I cannot really recommend Tinder and these other dating apps to men. Unless you're a solid 9/10 with great pictures, you're not going to be doing yourself a favor. In my situation however everything was in lockdown, so I didn't have much of choice. In the months following I just kept working on myself (gym, presentation, attitude, mentality, discipline) and actually had a cute Chinese girl (what, again? This one actually lives in China though) reach out to me here on Reddit in response to some hookup post I still had up. We just started talking about all sorts of things and eventually even escelated things to sexting. Confidence +1.\n\nThen halfway 2020, my sister's best friend (also a cute Chinese girl 🤯 I live in Europe btw) suddenly DMed me on Discord. I believe her very first message was some sort of meme or joke, which I responded to in a couple words. Over the course of the following weeks, every now and then she would send me another meme or something somehow relevant to me. At some point we actually started having full-blown conversations, and before I knew it we were talking to each other every single day. \n\nI was reluctant at first since this was my sister's best friend and there was a bit of an age difference, but we really hit it off and I couldn't ignore the fact that I liked her and that the age difference didn't seem to bother me in any way. This went on for just over 4 months (since that first DM), and also ended in us sexting before we had even met up in person (I had met her before as she was my sister's best friend, but never just the two of us). We met at her place (she lives alone), and the sexual tension was skyhigh as soon as I set foot inside that appartment. \n\nThat day marked the beginning of a very bumpy relationship that would last just over a year, but I got over it pretty quickly and realized that it was just never going to work between us. I am however very grateful for the experience and confidence I gained with her. We experimented a lot sexually and she did help bring out the confident man inside of me. \n\nIt has now been 2.5 months since that breakup and 3.5 months since I last had sex, and yet I still feel better than ever. I'm happy with the way I look, I'm happy with the way I dress, I feel more confident than ever and I have no doubt I will meet another girl who I will hit it off with.It actually feels exciting to be single again: something I never thought I'd say. \n\nI have a subtle smile glued to my face everywhere I go, and every time I see a cute girl I'll try to make eye contact - resulting in a smile back half the time. I can just tell that other people also look at me differently now. \n\nSo yeah, this is my story dumbed down to essay-length. It's not particularly interesting and definitely not something to brag about - if anything, these are just the highly personal details of me making higher lows in life over the past three years. But I guess that's part of the point I'm trying to make: you don't simply wake up confident one day. You won't just have an epiphany that turns you into a casanova. It's going to be a slow grind, a marathon really, but the finishline won't be the goal, 'cause you'll never actually reach it. \n\nYou will however at one point feel that you've been running for quite some time, and that you're not going to be stopping any time soon. And I think that is the spot you want to be aiming for. I know how hard it is to have zero experience with girls and women, but you're not alone, and it will only take one to break the vicious cycle. Hell, hire an escort to break the vicious cycle if you think that might help! There are no rules to this game, so use any edge you have. \n\nBut please get this nonsense like plastic surgery out of your head. The people who truly benefit from that know who they are, but the majority of you are all just average looking men (& some women) who have convinced themselves that they must be incredibly ugly. I am willing to bet every last penny I'm worth and my left nut that 99.9% of you all have not truly gone all the way in trying to improve every single thing they dislike about themselves. Why do I know that? Because neither have I, and I feel top of the world already. It'll be an everlasting work-in-progress, but I got an incredible amount done in just a year and a half. \n\nI hope these words were of some help or comfort to some of you, albeit just one person. If so, it was worth the trouble of writing down. Also feel free to DM me if you need anybody to talk to or need some personal advise - I'll be here ✌🏻\n\nTL;DR\nBecame increasingly dissatisfied with myself and my inability to find intimacy, and started working on everything I disliked about myself three years ago. Started going to the gym, changed my hair & way of dressing, got something prescribed for my acne, obsessively sought out contact with girls both online and offline, and purposely did things outside my comfort zone. 3 years later I have finally experienced a first relationship and feel better and more confident than ever before.",

                "text_body": "Heya guys, I’ve been on this sub for a long time and had always believed myself to be an FA. I’ve never had anyone show any kinda interest in me and every single girl gave me the cold shoulder, ghosted, some were kind about it, others were not.\n\nI’m only about 21 but for all that time I’ve been a KHV and there was no sign of it stopping, until I met her. I’ve been on tinder for about 5 years and I’ve had a few matches here and there but never any real conversations and DEFINITELY never any dates. But this girl was different. We bonded over Marvel and I asked her on a pasta date (her favorite). She said sure and I was super nervous about my first date ever.\n\nDuring the date we talked and had a really good time. Conversation flowed well and we both seemed very into it. She invited me to an impromptu movie right afterwards and we both enjoyed it. I had never kissed anyone so at the end of the date we only hugged. Since then we had texted a lot and hung out together frequently. For two months we saw each other like 4 times a week. She eventually showed me how to kiss, showed me her body, and we cuddled. She was the most beautiful girl I have ever seen and she was here for me! It was clear that she liked me too. Then my FA started showing.\n\nI got jealous since she was still friends with all her ex boyfriends and was intimate with them, how she’s an extremely attractive girl and she is always getting hit on by other men. But through it all she reassured me and stuck through it. I assured her that it was something I was passionate to change and I did, for the most part. I felt like the luckiest person alive. But in the end, the relationship didn’t work out, and it was because of me.\n\nI wanted a girl who I could have deep conversations with, but everything was surface level for her. Every time I talked about the things I wanted to talk about she got frustrated for not understanding and I got frustrated for her not trying to understand. She made the hard decision first saying that we are probably better as friends. And surprising even to me, I agreed. If fact we were in a limbo period where we knew what needed to be done but both of us didn’t want to take the full leap. Until one day I told her that I needed to get over her because it just hurt too much, and she agreed.\n\nFrom my 2 month relationship I learned that going into a one as an FA will cause A LOT of issues, but if you can find someone to stick with you on it while you fix it, then it will be the best experience you’ve ever had. Sure a relationship may be “overrated”, but don’t let anyone fool you into thinking that it sucks, or that you’re “lucky” to be single. The warm feeling I felt was 100% worth all the pain and struggle we both went through, and I would do it all again in a heartbeat. I may not be an FA anymore but I will still give back to the community that raised me lol.\n\nPS. This relationship has given me undue confidence. If a girl like THAT liked me then I can get another one that I really like as well, but just better for me. I think out of everything, my mentality change is what is going to benefit me most. See you on the other side soldiers!",

It's not even comparable. If one girl liked you, it's very likely an another one will like you as well. \n\nThe rest of us, based on our experiences we have no reason to believe that something like that will ever happen.",

                        "comment": "\"forever alone is a phase for some\" Well then it's not forever alone if it's a phase you grew out of.\n\nYou're just a normal person who was a late bloomer (unironically). Which probably means you never had any serious issues to begin with and were able to eventually have sex during the normal course of development. Wouldn't be surprised if you had a first kiss and gfs years earlier but stilled considered yourself forever alone. Assuming this post isn't some lame troll to begin with.\n\nContrast this to a NEET or a post-college kissless virgin who is irrevocably developmentally stunted from this shit and is fundamentally neurodivergent and unrelatable to those around him. Those who are genuinely fucked up don't just randomly blossom in college.\n\nThese are not the same things, though the line is blurry. I wish normal people would stop appropriating these labels like they're some hip trend.",

So how come when you get close to a woman with the intent to date her you’re a “nice guy” or a certain word that starts with  I? Because from my understanding if you somehow do miraculously start dating with a girl if you talk to other women they get jealous or think you’re cheating…. And this isn’t just an online social media thing this is also a irl thing because I have seen plenty of girls think the guy is cheating and yes this also happens the other way with men getting jealous. Me personally knowing other men I’m not sure if I would be comfortable with that, you can call me insecure but I’m not naive. But i digress, so if this is the case I don’t understand how I’m a bad person if I connect with a girl with that intent since I would never approach a girl I knew had a boyfriend even if I wanted to be “friends” with her I feel uncomfortable being around girls when they have boyfriends because I don’t like misunderstanding which is understandable. Anyways everyone have a nice day! 😊\n\nTl;dr- Title\n",

They may be below average but it doesn't matter as long as we have the same interests, values and so on. I'm below average myself. I would date an \"ugly\" man. I can't see myself with a super hot or attractive man, to be honest. I'd be incredibly intimidated and nervous about not being good enough. Constantly doubting myself and engaging in even more self-hate than normal. Best thing is for everyone to pair with someone similar in looks to them. That's my ideal.\n\nExample of things I don't find ugly that other women might: hairy, fat (not morbidly obese), short, acne or skin issues (I have skin issues myself), poor quality skin, uneven skin tone, warts, and I can't really think of the rest. Even if he has a major facial deformity or a disability, that's not necessarily a dealbreaker. What matters more is his attitude & if he's capable of grooming himself and being hygienic. A lot of men are ugly because they're ungroomed. Same goes for women, though we have to keep ourselves as hair-free as possible to look \"presentable\".",

True attraction is something organic, that grows out of intangible things - intelligence, kindness, generosity, honesty, sincerity; among many other incandescent inner qualities a human being can develop over their lifetime.  So very often; people who might be considered physically “beautiful” by societal standards are in truth vapid, shallow, selfish, manipulative, hurtful and narcissistic.  It is absolutely true that you cannot in any way judge a book by its cover.  Personally, I am only attracted to men who are loving, sweet, affectionate, empathetic and kind.

He saw I was active on tinder subreddits giving reviews of peoples pages and asked if I could do his after chatting/enquiring about the room. \n\nI am on the waiting list for an autism assessment and half way through an ADHD one so I don’t get subtle hints. Well I was completely blunt and tore apart his tinder profile. We kept chatting every so often until he asked to meet up. \n\nHe came over and said he had been hinting he liked me for a while over the messages and frequently texting subsequently after. \n\nAnyway it was a duh moment that he had been flirting so I suggested something casual and it went from there. He came over a couple of times, we had drinks and he stopped the night. A few months later we made it official.\n\nThe drinking evenings really helped loosen both of us up as he’s also neurodivergent. We spent hours chatting and listening to music channels. Found out we had a lot in common. He was also very respectful of me and my home. Anyway I made him laugh one night so hard he fell into my fridge. We’ve now been together for 2 years, I’m a step mum to his son and we live together.\n\nI wasn’t looking at the time and frankly wasn’t interested in any relationships. I had been spending that time working on my mental health and getting my home in order ‘so to speak.’\n\nI’m not sure why I’m on this subreddit. It came up as a recommend sub a few years ago. I really hope someone comes along for you OP and for the others in here. I apologise if I’ve over stepped by commenting on this thread and sub.",

I eventually chased one of them, shoved him to the ground and got an apology while holding his backpack hostage.\n\nAmong with other experiences of being called ugly, accumulations of these events makes me afraid even to develop feelings for guys.

There's a big difference there.\n\nThere are different types of ugly. Some people might just have weird proportions, others can have birth deformities, burns, scars, birthmarks or a skin condition.\n\nMost importantly it's all relative and subjective\n\nThose boys could just have been mean and it's not true or severely exaggerated.

Looking back I wasn't as fat and ugly as they had me believe I was.\n\nIt could all be in your head, as a form of insecurity and warped perception. It's really hard to consider yourself good looking when you subconsciously think of yourself as ugly.\n\nTbh it's hard to tell if you're ugly just from a description and without a photo, but I'm sure you're not ugly, it's just all in your head.",

I was naive and didn’t understand that there is more to a person- MUCH more to a person - than meets the eye, and looks don’t have to be a be all end all. \n\nI realise now the irony of my actions when I was younger; trying to go after people who were leagues above me instead of getting to know the genuine girls in front of me and around me.\n\nIt’s too late to go back, and I doubt I’ll find anyone who likes me in future (regardless of looks) because I have essentially given up on even having a slither of a chance of a relationship. I realise now that looks truly are subjective; and women that are typically considered conventionally unattractive are actually beautiful, it’s not just personality but how they act, how they speak and what they’re like to be around day to day.\n\nI won’t find love now, but I hope for anyone reading this; DONT make the same naive mistakes I did, looks are not everything and you will eventually find you love someone for being their pure authentic self.",

There's other victory conditions like Sacred Site Control or building a Wonder but those are difficult to maintain control over. They also got some beautiful single player campaigns + cutscenes with voice acting Narrator.\n\nWW might be mechanically closer to Genshin and technically better Genshin than HSR. Genshin has some core problems since Year 1 that haven't been worked on cause it's a massive cash cow for Hoyo. There's also some EN VA issues that make me feel annoyed about quests cause it's lackluster without that.\n\nHSR is a Turn Based RPG made by Hoyo again. It's set in another universe. You use 4 characters but it's turn based combat with Speed/Action forward based mechanisms. Though it suffers from pull characters or miss out on enriching gameplay. So up to you on whatever you wanna do.",

Do you put enough effort into self-improvement. I know I didn't before, and had bad results. When I put the effort in, everything changed. I definitely used to think I was FA, and it's still a struggle at times for me. You always have that emotional baggage. However, when you change your mindset of changing for others to changing for you, then people start to like you. Focus on your own interests and hobbies, health, hygiene. \n\n  \nSomething that blows my mind, is that a lot of FA people, don't do the basics when it comes to self-care. They don't shower, take care of their teeth, work out, try to eat somewhat healthy, stay at a healthy body weight, but get upset when the person they like (who does those things) isn't interested in them. \n\n  \nI think a lot of FA people are depressed narcissists in a way and think they should be liked because they're \"nice\" but if all their needs aren't met, they are critical. Same way FA types are so overly critical of superficial things about women. Part of me feels bad about it, but part of me also thinks they bring it on themselves honestly.",

If that continues for decades maybe I WILL have dementia at 50 without the 50/50 I'll get love.\n\nLoneliness is really bad on your health. Not to mention that past the age of like 50-60, living alone is straight up living on impossible mode. You'll become weaker physically, and you won't have kids or a spouse to help you get groceries, carry along heavy furniture, get you to the hospital or whatever. Everyone's looking at loneliness through the perspective of someone at their health peak in their 20s and 30s while you can still earn money easily and don't have a lot of health issues. Being lonely for that long would be nearly as miserable as having dementia at that age tbh.",

From the ones OP mentioned:\n\n* similar beliefs are optional for me as long as it does not cause trouble all the time. I simply would not talk about them if it causes troubles and would hope she does the same.\n* Similar hobbies are certainly a nice to have, but as long as it's something I would really hate I think I could get along with some stuff\n* Attractiveness isn't that important to me, so not a requirement. However, I don't want her to look like she has a genetic defect, but if I know the effect is only acquired it's not a problem for me any more. Also, she must not look like she has an infectious disease. Again, if she has a skin condition but I know it's not infectious I wouldn't care too much\n* Similar personalities are certainly nice, but tbh my personality likely would be the bigger issue ... so ig she would need to be a bit tolerant here\n* Yeah, a bit shorter than me would be nice, but is not required for me\n\nI don't think it's that stupid to have standards. A relationship IMHO should improve the situation compared to having no relationship. And as much being lonely sucks, being abused IMHO would suck more as you couldn't even rely on her as she could easily leave you when you would get in need.",

Was a 5'4 clearly over 350 lb man now I'm not calling him fat or anything I myself am 450 lb but the whole time they were sitting together whispering and laughing little did I know halfway into the show she gets on stage after disappearing for a while and as she was on stage performing I was absolutely gobsmacked if she didn't look like an angel before she looked like a goddess with all the silver and light up umbrella accompanying her. You could tell the stage was hot and as she was dancing sweat was accumulating on her skin is as if rays of light bounced off of every inch of her and I'm not going to lie that's slight bit of fascination I had about this couple drove me to almost question him how did he do it.

You can be the Richest person or be the most intelligent person but if you are not physically attractive then chances of someone else truly falling in love with you is impossible. \n\nMutual Physical Attraction is absolute No 1 trait that needs to be exist between 2 people for them to have a healthy relationship. If that doesn't exist then either the relationship is working on compromise, or one person is forced to stay for some reason or the relationship will just eventually break. \n\n  \nI'm not blaming people for being shallow or anything. Attraction is important and its just a truth that people should be honest about when dating rather than saying they look for personality, attitude etc. ",

Within weeks they were already discussing marriage, moving in together and IVF; it was pretty obvious that they both saw it as their final chance at ever getting married or having a kid like the rest of their families were doing. But I can’t recall them ever being romantic, tactile or even particularly polite with each other; they’ve been quite clear about how they “tolerate” each other to keep things simple. To this day, their nonexistent chemistry can’t even be considered friendly or jovial, they exist solely as gloomy, grumpy roommates. And although I do feel bad for how passionless and unfulfilling their lives have been, all of their choices have been their own. It was a textbook settling-out-of-desperation-and-loneliness story. And despite being chronically antisocial, reclusive and pessimistic, there have been countless times that they’ve berated me for my shyness, social anxiety and unwillingness to push my own boundaries.

I’ve never felt insecurity about my appearance, and even receive compliments on my looks occasionally. Many people are perplexed when they learn I’ve never been in a relationship, and I don’t fully understand why either. I’d say that on a romantic level, I feel hopelessly incompetent. I don’t know how to express interest in people. Often times I wonder if I feel any interest at all. I’ve also been harmed/embarrassed/betrayed a number of times in the past by people I cared for, and I think I carry this around with me pretty heavily. When someone comes through my life who I could potentially establish a relationship with, I can’t muster the courage, interest, or will to engage with them. I think I sabotage myself in this sense, but I can’t really help it. The world of reciprocal affection is totally alien to me. I don’t even consider it a possibility for myself because I feel too broken. \n\nI’d be curious to hear other reasons that people are FA that might be lesser-discussed.",

It's something I notice a lot, especially when it differs from what I'm used to see.\n\nTo my surprise, I came across many characters in the works of the authors I mentioned who were not engaged in relationships. Their situations vary, but none of them ever say anything like, *\"No woman – I'm a loser...\"* They live their lives, and most of them seem content with their marital status.\n\nI've been thinking about this for a while… What if modern relationship standards aren't as embedded in us as we perceive them to be? They exist the way they do now, but they may change in 50 years or so. What if the feeling that we *want* to be in a relationship doesn't actually come from within us, but from external influences? Movies, modern books, and social media have created an image of the \"perfect life scenario\"—but it's not perfect because it truly benefits us; it's perfect because we *believe* it is.\n\nThe only thing we need to do now is stop thinking the way this scenario dictates and instead focus on what truly feels right and comfortable for us.",

                        "comment": "I maintain that modern media's focus on romance for the purpose of selling you a feeling is the very root of the following issues:\n\n1. Our feelings of Forever-aloneness\n\n2. Some people's descent into becoming hateful i***ls\n\n3. The just-world-fallacy as \"normal\" people apply it to romantic experience - in other words: that people who experience romance must be able to do so because they either are good or expend the \"correct\" amount of effort; and that those who do not experience romance must either be bad or be expending the \"wrong\" amount of effort, whether too much or not enough.\n\nBecause here's the common thread between all of those - that romance is supposedly quintessential to the human experience, and thus an *expectation*.\n\nWe are not explicitly told this. It is not taught to us directly by our parents, nor through our schooling. But our capitalistic corporate media want to make money, and they do so by commodifying *emotion itself* - selling us an idea of love; and what's more, selling us *hope*, an *expectation*, that we should one day experience it - and so they shove romance down our throats at every turn, even when it is not strictly necessary to the larger narrative.\n\nThe specific way in which they have done this has influenced us to believe that romance \"just happens\" to people - of which the corollary, of course, is that if it doesn't happen to someone, they must not be \"people.\" And so - because of this subconscious, unsaid, and largely unintentional implication - lacking romance becomes an issue - not just of loneliness or even the fear of missing out - but of being denied our own humanity.\n\nFor those of us who consider ourselves forever alone, we mourn this supposed loss of humanity when we fail to realize this social expectation of romance; but we direct our despair and hatred inward, wishing we could somehow become more \"human\" in some abstract, unattainable way, and thus eligible as a romantic partner. In other types of loners - whom one might describe with the i-word - they become angry, senselessly lashing out and blaming individuals for a more systemic problem that has been unintentionally fostered as a side effect of the capitalistic sale of positive feelings. And finally, in those who have consistently been able to find and experience romance, their experience only confirms what the media have taught them: that they were destined to have it. Thus, they cannot comprehend another kind of existence in which achieving romance is impossible despite all effort put into finding it.\n\nWhat ALL of these viewpoints fail to take into account is this: that romance is, in fact, NOT ubiquitous, nor must it be according to some arbitrary moral or social standard. It is NOT necessarily quintessential to the human experience; and one's self-worth - one's humanity - *cannot* and *must not* be measured using romantic success as a primary factor.\n\nWe all have value beyond our ability to find a partner. Some of us have other things to focus on. In the past, many scientists, artists, scholars, and philosophers *chose* a life of solitude, seeking pleasure through enlightenment, education, and entertainment. If you don't know what goal to pursue outside of romance, maybe you haven't found yours yet. Keep looking. There are other reasons to live.\n\nA lack of romance doesn't take your humanity from you; you are just as much of a *person* as anyone else, and so you do not deserve your self-hatred. Be kind to yourself, because - unintentionally or not - the media have made you believe a *lie* about what it means to be human. Work on internalizing a new idea: that romance does not necessarily give you value, nor does a lack of romance take value away; and find freedom in this - the freedom to move on and live your life. A new purpose is waiting for you should you choose to search for it, whatever it may be.",

That's 157cm and honestly that's my biggest obstacle. Even my ex used to call me a little man etc. People laugh at me for being so short. It's a constant barrage of abuse for it.\n\nI spent a long time feeling really angry and hurt when I was rejected because of my height. Women would say that I was sweet, but that they needed someone taller. I hit the gym, got shredded, nope, still too short. So I kind of lost a bit of my motivation to workout which I eventually got back because I started working out for me and not for anyone else. \n\nI've got many friends who are girls, but they see me as one of them now, like the nice friendly guy they can talk to about their problems, they talk to me about dating and how difficult it is to find a decent guy. \n\nOver time, I realised that this had the potential to turn me into a very bitter person if I let it get to me. It's nobody's fault that I'm short and it's not womens' fault they're naturally wired to only find taller guys attractive. It's not a personal slight against me, and if anything I should take it as a compliment that they *would* date me if I was taller! \n\nSo anyway, what I'm saying is, guys just let it go. If you can't date, you can't date. Don't go down the road of becoming bitter and resentful. Start loving yourself and the life you have been granted! Make the most of every moment and be kind to people around you. Life is so much more than dating and your worth is so much more than how attractive you are. \n\nI found letting go of the want to date and be seen as attractive very liberating. I reminded myself enough that I'm not attractive that it doesn't even cross my mind anymore and I've stopped looking to date. \n\nCelebrate being forever alone as just another part of life and spend it making friends, memories, having fun and doing good things in this world and it takes away your focus on this one aspect of your life ✌🏽",

First, if you've never dated, they're going to wonder why.  It might not be a dealbreaker, but unless you purposefully didn't attempt to date (rare and also unusual) they're going to be curious as to why NOTHING ever worked out with you and anyone else.\n\n  \nSecond, they will be nervous that you don't know how to navigate the intricacies of a relationship and probably aren't going to want to risk that you'll be able to do your part in that on your first attempt.  The older you are, the more likely this is to be the case.  Again people may deny it, but actions speak louder than words.\n\nMy friend once date a girl that was 32 and never dated before.  He had.  It was getting serious and then after just one \"argument\", she broke up with him because she felt overwhelmed.  He tried telling her that this type of stuff was normal and that they need to talk through it and compromise.  She wasn't hearing it at all and still ended it.  Everyone in our friend group talked about how it was a red flag that she had no experience, and that she's destined to die alone because clearly she has no idea how relationships work and has unrealistic expectations.  Again, this was a girl that was a 32 FA year old that gave up on a 6 month relationship after just one dispute over something that 99% of the population wouldn't even consider an issue.\n\nThe way my friends (guys and girls alike) talked about her was so surreal.  They don't know I'm FA, they think I dated when I was younger, so they didn't hold back.  \"She's destined to die alone with her cats\" \"If you're in your 30s and never dated, you know somethings wrong\" \"Dude you didn't dodge a bullet, you dodged a cannonball\"\n\n",

Also, if it’s OK or nothing wrong for people to go to these places by themselves why is it very rare that I see anyone by themselves at these places or events?\n\nIt sucks being alone and living more than three decades of your life with no one interested to want to fall in love with you. It sucks a whole lot more being told the same things in your 30s, 40s, and even your 50s by these normies, some of them young enough we can be their father already.",

I wish I could have that badly, I don't know if that could ever fix me but I know I have a deep desire to just be loved and desired by someone like that in my life.\n\n\n\n I know I don't deserve it and that's why I can only dream. These days before I sleep I start dreaming of my first crush and different stories and lives we could've had. Us being friends for years before we decided to date, or breaking up and getting back together or any other corny thing my mind can think of. It helps to forget in the 2 years I knew her before she left my high school I barely said anything to her\n\n\n\nIt's not even about her it's just the idea of what she could represent, I literally know nothing about her at all. But still these days I can't get these thoughts and daydreams out of my head. I'm almost tired of it. I'll be thinking about it for so long daydreaming that when I get back to real life I almost forget that it's a fantasy. But I've gotten so into the idea of dreaming about it that I can't stop it really does just make me feel so much better with whatever scenario I can imagine \n\n\n\n It's just depressing man, I wish I could get these thoughts out my mind but they're very human thoughts. It'd just be nice to feel loved or at least desired in any way. Just any sort of physical touch or intimacy would make me feel something I wish I could stop desiring but probably never will. Shit it might get worse the older I get and I'll have nothing to do about it",

I know most people who read this will roll their eyes but you asked so there is my answer. I wish you and everyone else the best of luck :) ❤️\n\nTo explain why I visit this sub often: I have a friend who is in their late 20's and when I met them they were basically in the FA headspace without the title. I've learned a lot through him and vice versa. They have hope too, a lot more then they once did. We converse a lot about things related to FA and this sub so I see it on my page a lot.",

When you say ask someone out that I see during my day, do you mean just walking up saying, \"hey, I'm X - would you want to go out on a date with me?\" Cause like, there's a 0% chance that works for a guy as ugly as me - and yes, *that* would get the cops called on me at least 1% of the time. Not a risk I'm willing to take for absolute 0 chance of a positive outcome.  \n\nBut, if you mean like \"chat her up\" or w/e, try to make small talk etc., I have tried that in the past too. No one ever engages with me. Because I would wager 0% of people who are just in public, minding their own business, want some random stranger to interrupt what they're doing/thinking about to talk to them. Especially if they are fat, weird and awkward.  \n\nThis is true during social events as well, just to a lesser extent.

Each relationship teaches you smth, about interaction/communication etc, so it’s never pointless. Most likely you will be hurt and no matter how strong you are, you will still have some feeling of blame/fail. I know that those exs were not compatible and I did my best, but everytime I had a feeling like I failed, guess it’s even worse when you rly put effort in relationships. \n\nI would say don’t be fixated on that topic at any stage. If you click with someone, try to enjoy that time and experience the most together. But erase any plans, expectations. Overall I appreciate the experience with all my partners, good and bad memories. \n\nif you are sensitive, better wait. If you feel like you did enough work and want to experience love etc, try to be open to meeting ppl and going out. Everyone is at different life stage, it’s all up to you, what you want.

I was ten years-old when for the last time I had any friends. After that - I don't know how or why it happened -, I was pretty much tortured for the next 5 years. Beaten, stolen from, my hair set on fire, being ridiculed in every way imaginable. Now, that was also at a time where you would normally develop an interest in girls and relationships. But being treated how I was, I got scared of other humans. And I always sought the error with myself. If others treated me badly, must be my own fault, right? I surely have done something wrong, and I deserve it. If only someone would've told me *what* I did wrong, but nobody ever did lol\n\nAnd today at 35, there are also other things holding me back. I have a certain disability and have to wear hearing aids, for one thing. That doesn't really makes connecting with people any easier.\n\nBut yes, I think it would be fixable. But the first steps are the hardest. It's like having zero money or even being in debt. It's very hard to work yourself out of there. But if you're a millionaire already then making money is incredibly easy. It's the same with human connection: Having strong bonds with your friends, knowing the friends of your friends, that's a huge head start to connect with even more people.

Its ok to hold eye contact for a bit if someone interests you but thats also dependant on the environment and situation. If youre at a social gathering then prolonged eye contact is a good way to communicate that you want to interact with someone, but if youre just running errands, it could easily be misinterpreted as weird or aggressive. This is especially true if theres no real reason to actually follow up and talk to them later. Also know that some people may maintain eye contact as a way to monitor their threat if they feel like theyre in danger. Again context and the intended follow up are incredibly important.\n\nEdit: sometimes people will also try to lock eyes with someone they think they recognize. If it turns out you dont know that person, it can be very awkward to be stared at by someone you then realize is a stranger. If youre in an appropriate social situation, also try to read the other persons reaction when doing so and not just how long they look at you. Other facial queues, body language and vocal intonations if theyre talking can amount to an appearance of interest or literally any other reaction depending on what they are.",

So I've also trained myself to make eye-contact as well. I don't do it while walking but only when I'm talking to someone. I know I still look away when I'm the one speaking, that's just habit because I'm thinking, but when they're saying something to me I make eye-contact. Decently intense so because I don't look away until they do (rare) or when I start speaking. \n\nIt's actually gone very well for me. It's honestly not uncommon for me to be listening to a woman while making eye-contact and she ends up smiling or giving a small laugh or blush. \n\nA big tip I would give is to work on your smile and resting face. Eye-contact with resting-bitch face will go very badly for you and people will think you're a threat or creepy. Eye-contact with a neutral face, or better yet a slight smile will made people think you're friendly and engaged in what they're saying.\n\nSomething I did when I was training myself for this too was to stare into the mirror, make your face as neutral as possible and then give a slight smile. See which muscles activate and are easy to control, then train yourself to have those particular muscles in your face always slightly activated.\n\nBasically, 10 would be a full-on Chesire cat grin, 1 would be your lips are slightly curved upwards at the corners but before your cheeks crease.

At that point, the damage is already done, and trying to recover from that will make finding the correct intensity much harder since people will be wary of you from then on.\n\nAnd you know what, youre absolutely right about internet advice. I dont know you and you dont know me so healthy skepticism is always a good way to operate.

Im not saying this is impossible in the US, in favct it happens a lot. But in the passport bro situation, it is done with the pretense that the man has the upper hand in the power dynamic by preying on disadvataged women whom he believes will be easier to coerce than one who is on equal social and financial footing.\n\nEdit: id also like to point out that the immediate appeal to financial advantage, proves my original point.",

They’ve had a normal social life growing up and even as adults. I’m 33F, I literally had creeped out a few guys because I made my crush obvious in college. It’s humiliating but I was desperate. Now if I chase for marriage, if I have someone on the interment who doesn’t know how socially awkward I am like me, I’m told to have better self esteem, not chase, etc. \n\nI read a comment in FAW by someone who said that it’s so stupid when normies say your self esteem shouldn’t  depend on people when humans thrive on social/romantic experiences since they day they can play with other kids! No crap one is going to have low self esteem if they’ve always had social anxiety and never fit in. Then my mom thinks it’s all me especially if I say my rageful, emotionally abusive father knocked all the confidence out of me to the point I still get panicky in most social situations. I’m so sick of having our problems minimized. I know I gotta stop chasing and getting so attached for my own spice of mind but to tell me to have better self worth…again everyone should in theory but that’s not reality  \n\nI told my brother Reddit is the only place I can go for comfort and he said “everyone has problems”.

I went to my uncles instead and used that as a reason/excuse why I missed the field trip to d.c. the truth is I wouldn’t have any friends to hang out with and it wouldn’t  been painfully awkward like recess, local field trips, lunch, etc. Anyone who meets him can definitely tell he had a normal experience growing up and even to this day I’m a bit envious of all the group chats, his ability to talk to people easily, go on trips with friends, hang out with people on the weekend etc. I love my brother but he’s an insensitive normie jerk too.",

Think of it as a built in defense mechanism. Regardless of what the popular narrative is or anyone looking for social brownie points, relationships/friendships are superbly detrimental to the cognitive development of a human being, including missed milestones.

If you’re just going to focus and boohoo about being alone and expect someone to just magically show up at your door and ask to date you, *you are wrong.* Hence root of the problem discovered and a course of action ca n be taken. \n\nOr just stay home, play video games and whine about being alone, idc.

Sometimes not physically, sometimes not intellectually and creatively, and most of the time not either of those things. I was with them because they were someone willing to be with me. (and I was horny and very apathetic. Like. To an almost monstrous degree. Anywho lol).\n\nBut there's a very uncomfortable thing that is if the person isn't attracted to you (or you to them) in as many ways as possible, the relationship is at best going to end...\n\n ...And at worst continue on with one person living in disappointment and annoyance at the fact that they're not with someone who they actually like and want to be with, and the other person suffering from being subjected to the behavior of someone who is disappointed and annoyed by them.\n\nIt's not fair, to either side. Wastes everybody's time and energy.\n\nI just think that having the perspective that you would be with anyone is looking for a problem, because keep looking long enough and you'll find that... But again, in the end, don't think it'll be bringing happiness or satisfaction.\n\nPlus it iiiis kind of selfish to do.
