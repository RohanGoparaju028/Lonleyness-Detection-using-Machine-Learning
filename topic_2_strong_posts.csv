Everything is becoming a trigger. What is happening to me?,"
I’m in a state of constant emotional pain, and I don’t know how to describe it. But I am having a weird problem- almost everything around me is turning into a trigger like ""trauma"" (? Loosely defining)

It’s not just memories — it’s everyday places, sounds, even foods. And it’s not just mild discomfort — it’s a flood of unbearable emotional pain, anxiety, and sometimes even physical symptoms like dizziness or feverishness. These “triggers” aren’t just reminders. They feel like the original pain is happening all over again.

Some examples:

- I listened to a specific piece of music once during a painful moment. Now I can’t listen to that song — not even a second — without feeling overwhelmed, almost like I’m being attacked from the inside.

- I walk down a certain road regularly and I did walk down that road when I was deeply hurting. That road now feels unbearable to even think about. Going near it makes my chest tighten and my head spin.

- My dorm room — I spent a couple months there while I was in pain every single day. Now the whole dorm, even the idea of returning, feels suffocating. I get feverish.

- the foods I eat has become such objects too, and now I can’t eat anymore. And any foods that hurt me somehow. But it’s spreading — even foods I’ve tried afterward are becoming linked to that pain. I’m losing weight because eating is getting harder and harder.

- I’m around people, and even they start to feel like triggers — not because they’re bad people, but they were the There are things I don’t like about people. I am very sensitive to people's behaviour anyway. If I notice lies, greed or hostility I feel so weird, almost dread, it hurts. (I am not saying I don’t have those) I can't meet them anymore.

- Anything that hurts me (usually I get hurt really intensely) can become Such trigger. And almost always I am having depression, Mental agony and anxiety.

I don't know if  these make sense? 

It’s like everything is infected with emotional weight. There are hundreds of these triggers, and I feel like I’m getting emotionally traumatized again and again, every single day. And the more I try to push through, the worse it gets. Exposure doesn’t help — it intensifies things. It’s like the pain is feeding itself. The trigger gets stronger every time I try to ignore it and focus on something else.

And this is happening on top of a baseline of constant mental pain, depression, and anxiety. I barely get a break. There’s always something hurting me, always something heavy. I’m exhausted. Everything feels unsafe and painful, even just trying to live a simple day.

What is happening to me?  Is this trauma-related? Or something else? I am diagnosed Persistent Depression, Gad anxiety, BPD. A reason why I am always suffering from Mental agony. I’ve read about trauma, depression, BPD — but nothing seems to explain this continuous, growing, multi-directional pain that’s eating away at my life.

If you relate or have gone through something like this, I’d really appreciate hearing from you. I’m starting to feel completely alone in this."
"Even if you feel deeply lonely, don’t settle for the only relationship you can get—especially if there are red flags from the start.","I’m a 34-year-old man, and in my life, I’ve only had one relationship. Strangely, I felt lonelier in that relationship than I ever did alone. Before we got together, we were friends—and during that time, I didn’t feel lonely. But the closer we became, the more we changed, and the more isolated I felt. That relationship came with many negative emotions.

In the early stages, I blamed myself for everything—even when she lashed out at me. I told myself I had no experience with relationships, that I didn’t understand how they worked, and that it was all my fault. I thought, “If I just change, things will get better.” Instead of walking away, I dug in deeper—far too deep. I felt desperately lonely, and this seemed like my only chance at a relationship. Despite all the red flags and clear signs that it wasn’t going to work, I kept pushing through because I didn’t want to be alone.

I remember feeling intense jealousy in the evenings, walking by myself and seeing couples out together—laughing, chatting, just being. For them, it all seemed so natural. Relationships looked easy, like second nature. But not for me.

One of the hardest things to accept is that I’m massively unattractive. My recent Tinder experience says it all: 12,000 right swipes, 21 matches. Out of those 21, at least half didn’t even reply. I could hardly believe I had swiped that many times—but that's what the stats showed.

On top of that, I struggle with social anxiety. My communication skills often feel like those of an alien who just landed on Earth—clueless about how to talk to people or fit in.

This post isn’t just to vent or cry. I’m always working to improve myself. In fact, after the breakup, my mental health began to improve. I’ve been making an effort to talk to more people and have joined some local groups. I still often feel lonely and misunderstood in those spaces—not many people can relate to what it’s like to struggle this much with basic communication—but I’m trying. As I get older, I’m learning to appreciate life more. I know I have to keep trying, and maybe, one day, I’ll meet people I can truly connect with.

So, if you’re lonely and find yourself in a relationship just because it’s an opportunity—please think carefully. Watch for red flags early. Don’t go as far as having a child with someone when the foundation of the relationship is already built on strange, often frightening arguments.

It’s tough, though. Honestly, if someone had tried to warn me back then, I probably would’ve just gotten defensive—stubborn like a ram—and kept going anyway. Still, that relationship taught me a lot about recognizing warning signs and understanding what relationships should and shouldn’t be.

Of course, I’d love to find a soulmate—someone who understands what it’s like to struggle with communication, maybe even someone going through something similar. Being a foreigner in the UK makes it even harder to feel like I belong. Though that’s not the main issue—the core of it is my difficulty connecting with people.

I’m not going to lie—part of the reason I’m writing this is the hope that maybe, just maybe, there’s a lost soul out there like me. Someone who struggles with the same kind of social anxiety, who might read this and feel seen. And maybe, in some dream-like way, I’d receive a message that says:  
  
""Let's go, our paths align. I can relate. I am an alien too. We'll figure it out together.""

Of course, I know I’m exaggerating a little with the words…  
But still—this is my dream.

breakup realisations: avoidant exes,"i have been thinking a lot throughout my breakup and have made some groundbreaking realisations for myself. it’s been painful seeing that my ex is doing fine and feels better off without our relationship but i’ve been unnecessarily punching myself in the gut over the fact that they haven’t shown any sign of grieving or caring about the breakup, thinking that it had something to do with me.
 
i realised only moments ago that my ex with a slight avoidant attachment style, is probably unable to feel what i feel and probably coping through avoiding grief, misery, longing, and even love. all these weeks after the breakup i constantly thought to myself “wow, they are so heartless and uncaring, did our relationship really mean nothing to them? am i invaluable and not good enough? maybe they’re not even thinking about me anymore.” 
what i failed to realise sooner was that our relationship issues must have triggered my ex’s avoidance and they were unable to find those ‘love emotions’ for me.

this might still be something they’re struggling with, which could explain why they don’t feel as much of a sense of longing, loss, sadness, fondness, and care for me and what we shared. i know that conflict and personal attacks are some of the things that trigger avoidants the most, our unhealthy relationship brought out unhealed, fearful, survival-mode versions of us when we fought and for my ex, whenever i made them feel uncomfortable/unconfident as well. i could not read their coping mechanism and how they’re processing the breakup because i only know my own triggers and pain but with what i know and have experienced with their avoidant attachment style, this might explain things. 

i get it, how would they be able to care for or miss me when they’re busy protecting themselves from feeling attacked, judged, uncomfortable? maybe it’ll take my ex some time and healing work until they feel ready to acknowledge any pain and the loss of our relationship — if they valued it in the first place, that is. of course there are moments where i have doubts; what did i do to deserve loving someone who doesn’t even love me until the end? i wrote them letters, begged for them back, would have fixed things, told them how much they meant to me, and not a word from them on how they felt about the years we shared. as adults now i do have an expectation of communication and being respected/valued but as someone who loved them so much, can see both our pain, i know finding the voice to be vulnerable one last time after everything went down must have been difficult and unnatural for them. so for that i will find it in myself to forgive them for not being able to love or care for me with the same intensity which left me heartbroken and confused. 

i am sorry to my ex for our relationship becoming unhealthy, bringing out negative qualities in us, and for things ending. i cannot imagine or truly empathise with the pain they may feel but can’t or don’t know how to express. i express my heartbreak through listening to love songs and breakup songs, speaking to people and seeking advice/support, taking the time to think about both good and bad things in our relationship, not shying away from remembering our memories, etc. and it’s helped me process the complexities of this experience.

in previous breakups with this person, i learned that they are aware of a few things relating to their own avoidant attachment — they feel the pain of the breakup a lot later, they put on an act to seem like they’re okay when they’re not and sometimes even believe they are, and they don’t like to share this vulnerability and seek support from loved ones, much less listen to breakup songs or think about the relationship. i can now say and see that their inability to grieve and be emotional about our breakup (which i also know is common with dumpers), the relief they feel that i took offence to, actually has nothing to do with my worth. like everyone else, i am a person that will be loved and then grieved when a relationship ends, but only a ‘healed’ person would be able to let themselves cry, miss me/us — my value and loveability doesn’t change whether or not my ex still cares for me. 

i know our relationship wasn’t always great but it was both our first and we did all that we could, with the little experience and knowledge we had, with our individual issues to work through. i hope they heal, all my best. 

edit: some people are making assumptions that i’m blaming my ex in any way (i don’t know how?) or that i’m invalidating their decision/feelings but this is more so to give myself an explanation as to why the person i am grieving doesn’t care (subjective, i know people process in different ways) about our breakup/me. some may say that’s a waste of time and unhealthy, i believe that clarity helps me make peace with it. i’m more content with realising my ex is human too, probably having their own issues with feeling/expressing their emotions which isn’t their fault, than to think “they didn’t love me enough, they don’t care at all, they’re heartless and they’re happy to leave me heartbroken”. isn’t that fair enough? also i know them, like i mentioned in the post i know that they’re not able to be vulnerable which explains to me why they’re not able to find the feelings that helps them say “hey, our relationship ended but i did love you a lot, you’re important to me, i do still care, i will miss you and i value what we shared” and again, that isn’t their fault. in saying all this and having this awareness, i know that i’m not going to and not able to love another person who can’t express their love emotions for me. i’m not a perfect person, i have attachment issues, i’m not a healthy partner, but i do know that a ‘healed’ person wouldn’t act like this and would express, to friends and family at minimum, that they grieve and care about the breakup. i’m not here for one sided love. i genuinely hope they get better because avoiding feelings as a coping mechanism/trauma response might make life a little easier for them but it’s not a good thing and isn’t healthy. it’s a shame that i’m on the receiving side of an avoidant’s breakup behaviour as i question everything we’ve shared and if they ever loved and valued me, but they’re still human and must be suffering in their own way.

Been stuck in a 5-year on-and-off relationship with a fearful avoidant. She ghosted me again—after promising to meet. I need tools to let go.,"Hi everyone,  
I’m (35M) coming out of yet another emotional spiral triggered by the same person—someone I’ve had a 5-year, on-and-off dynamic with. I have an anxious attachment style; she seems to lean fearful avoidant. It’s been a brutal cycle of closeness, withdrawal, promises, and disappointment.

Over the years, we’ve had moments of real connection. But also betrayals, unfaithfulness (even while we were supposedly exclusive), and emotional distance that never really healed. Despite all this, I kept showing up—maybe out of love, maybe out of unresolved wounds, or both. I supported her emotionally, logistically, and financially at times. Not to “buy” her, but because I genuinely cared and wanted her to feel safe.

Recently, we were both visiting our hometown (we live in the same city now). She told me she wanted to see me, picked out a gift which I got her, and we agreed to meet. I stayed longer, hoping to reconnect—at least to talk. But when the moment came… silence.

I reached out. No response. Tried again the next day—she replied coldly, said she was “in her own stuff” and hadn’t really thought about it. That triggered my anxious response, and I tried (too hard) to fix things. She said we’d talk later and still see each other. Then again… nothing. No cancellation. No goodbye. Just ghosting.

I sent a couple of respectful messages asking if we could talk, or at least say goodbye properly. I even offered her an out—told her that if she wanted us to go our separate ways, I would understand. I just didn’t want to be left in silence. She listened to my voice note. She read every message. But said nothing.

The silence isn’t new—but it hits harder this time. Maybe because I wasn’t asking for anything she hadn’t already promised. Maybe because I stayed hopeful when I should’ve known better. And once again, I find myself questioning if I’m “too much” for simply wanting clarity, kindness, or closure.

I know I may have come off as intense. I was trying to self-soothe, trying to reach for what little safety I thought we still had. But I didn’t lie, ghost, or disappear. I showed up—imperfectly, yes, but with sincerity.

She hasn’t blocked me. She hasn’t said “stop.” But she also hasn’t said anything. And that silence has been louder than any fight we ever had.

How do you let go of someone who leaves the door open, only to vanish when you walk through it?  
How do you stop chasing the version of them that only appears in rare, intoxicating glimpses?

I’m not writing this to be consoled—I’m writing because I want to grow.  
If you’ve loved someone with a fearful avoidant pattern while carrying an anxious one…  
How did you finally let go? How did you heal?

Thanks for reading."
To the people I love,"**To the People I Love,**

I’ve been thinking about how to write this, and I keep starting and stopping because nothing ever feels like enough. How do you explain something that’s been quietly unraveling inside for so long? How do you say goodbye when all you’ve ever wanted was to keep holding on?

The truth is, I’m tired. Not just sleepy or worn out—I mean the kind of tired that sits deep in your bones. The kind that no amount of sleep, or sunshine, or talking it out can fix. I've tried to keep going, to keep smiling, to keep being the version of me that you all know and love. But inside, it’s been so heavy for so long. And I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry that it’s come to this.

This isn’t about any one thing or any one moment. It’s been a slow burn—a daily battle with thoughts that don’t quiet, pain that doesn’t ease, and a feeling of being lost in a world that just keeps moving. I’ve fought silently because I didn’t want to worry you. I didn’t want to be a burden. But the truth is, I’ve been struggling in ways I couldn’t always put into words. I’ve felt invisible and overwhelmed, even when surrounded by love. And even when I knew how deeply I was cared for, I couldn't always feel it through the fog.

Please don’t think this is your fault. It’s not. You were never the reason—I promise. If anything, you were the reason I held on for as long as I did. Your love, your laughter, your presence—it kept me going on the days I thought I couldn’t. I’m endlessly grateful for every hug, every message, every silly moment and serious talk. I truly hope I gave you even a fraction of the comfort you gave me.

I know this will hurt. And that thought breaks my heart more than anything. But I need you to understand that I’ve reached a point where the pain inside is louder than the hope. I’m exhausted—not from life itself, but from the weight I’ve been carrying every single day. And I don’t want to keep pretending I’m okay when I’m not. I just can’t anymore.

I don’t know if this will bring peace or confusion. I don’t expect understanding, but I do hope for compassion. I hope that in time, you’ll remember me not for how I left, but for how I loved. How I tried. How I always wanted to make you laugh. How I cherished you—because I did, with all my heart.

Take care of each other. Please keep checking in on the quiet ones. Be gentle with the world and even more gentle with yourselves. And if you ever find yourself where I’ve been, please reach out. You are never weak for hurting. You are never alone, even if it feels that way.

Thank you for giving me moments of joy in the midst of my darkness. Thank you for seeing me, even when I felt invisible. Thank you for everything.

I love you. "
"She said she wanted just friendship, but our conversations felt like emotional dating. I pulled away, but it still messed me up.","I (24M) got emotionally tangled with someone I had only casually interacted with before. It started off light—a random conversation, a spark—and led to regular texting. Not just small talk. I’m talking late-night messages, emotional vulnerability, subtle flirting. We weren’t together, but it started to feel like… something.

Then she told me she’d recently ended a relationship and wasn’t looking for anything romantic—just connection and friendship. I said I respected that, but the truth is—I already had feelings.
I had them from the beginning. I told her, honestly, that I’d been into her since the first time I saw her.
The conversations just gave me a space to finally say it out loud.
And I think she knew.
She acted surprised when I told her how I felt—like I had overwhelmed her. She even asked if she’d emotionally cheated on her ex. I apologized, probably more than I should have.

For context, I’m fearful avoidant. She’s clearly anxious. And that combination created this intense, hot-cold rhythm. I’d pull back, she’d get closer. She’d distance, I’d reach out. I realized eventually that I was becoming emotionally available to someone who didn’t want the same thing—but still leaned on me for support and comfort.

She started suggesting that maybe I was “too much,” even hinted that her friends thought I was obsessive. But she also kept texting me. The inconsistency started to eat at me. It felt like we were both projecting unspoken needs onto each other, without ever naming them.

When I finally told her that I’d liked her for a while, her response was something like:

“But how could you even like me? You barely know me. You’ve only seen me briefly, in passing.”
That hit me hard—because at that point, we’d already shared some pretty vulnerable conversations. It made me feel like she was rewriting what had happened to protect herself from feeling guilty or responsible for the connection we built.

In one of our final conversations, she asked me whether I thought we could be close again someday. That line stuck with me—maybe more than it should have. It planted a seed of “what if,” even though I know deep down that the connection was unbalanced. And that’s the hardest part:

I still haven’t completely let go of the idea that maybe, sometime in the future, we might reconnect.

We still see each other in a weekly group event. It’s civil. Polite. But I feel like I’m carrying a weight from something that technically never happened. I walked away from it for my own sanity—but that doesn’t mean it didn’t leave a mark.

⸻

What I’m asking is:
	•	How do you emotionally process something that wasn’t a relationship but felt like one?
	•	How do you stop replaying it in your head, wondering where it crossed the line?
	•	Is it fair to feel hurt when they said “just friends,” but acted like more?
	•	Should I actively let go of that lingering hope for reconnection—or is it sometimes okay to see what happens down the line?"
Help? Trying to love myself...,"This pain still feels unmanageable at times.
The loss of everything I ever wanted—everything I thought I had for a while—still hits hard. I’m doing the work, trying to heal, asking myself: “What makes me happy?” Not just as a father. Not just as a partner. But me—outside of her, outside of anyone else.
It’s hard to admit that chasing happiness through someone else—through making them happy—wasn’t healthy. Realizing I may have been used until I wasn’t needed anymore... that hurts in a way I can’t explain. Accepting that it’s over doesn’t make the pain vanish. It doesn’t silence the negative thoughts. Trying to change those thoughts feels like pushing a boulder uphill every single day.
I’m hurting.
Day in, day out.
And losing access to my kids on top of it—it breaks me in ways I didn’t know I could break.
Why does nothing seem to bring me joy but the idea of a family? A spouse?
Why have I tied my entire sense of self to people who never saw me, appreciated me, or believed in me the way I believed in them?
Why is this world so cruel?
I feel like a character out of a tragedy. I never imagined the person I chose to build a life with would abandon me. I loved her. Unconditionally. With everything I had.
And yet—
Part of healing is forgiveness. And I do forgive.
Part of healing is trying to see myself the way others do… or even better. Learning to appreciate my flaws and my strengths. It sounds so simple—but it’s not, not for me.
Another part of healing is facing the truth: maybe I was the one who let the dream die, even while I was working so hard to keep it alive. I got lost in it. I forgot who I was. I forgot what I wanted. I forgot how to love myself. And now I’m here asking—how do I start to fix that? How do I even begin to learn self-love, when looking back, I don’t think I ever truly had it?
That lack of love for myself led me to someone who never loved me either—despite two children, and everything we shared.
How does a man even begin to change something that deep?
There’s still a lack of motivation to do the healing work. I can’t see joy or happiness beyond my kids. And while they are enough to live for, provide for, and raise into incredible people…
why does it feel impossible to find what makes me happy, outside of loving someone else?
She once told me she didn’t think I truly loved her—that she could be replaced by any woman. That wasn’t true. But… I can’t lie and say I didn’t place my entire sense of worth in being loved by someone. Maybe she wasn’t completely wrong.
So where do I begin…?

"I disappeared during a hard time, and now I feel like I’ve lost everyone and just feel so alone","I disappeared during a hard time, and now I feel like I’ve lost everyone

I’m 30, and for the last couple of years, I’ve basically shut down. My mental health took a serious dive, and I stopped showing up — for people, for myself, for everything. I lost all momentum. My life became: home, work, home, work. I stopped going to the gym. I stopped answering messages and calls. I stopped doing… anything, really. No holidays, no adventures, nothing.

People would reach out, and I’d want to reply — I really would — but I’d almost freeze, id look at it, and think I’ll reply later but later never came. I didn’t know what to say, or how to be honest about how bad I was feeling, at times not even realising how I was actually feeling. Days turned into weeks, and the guilt of not replying made it even harder to say something. So I just didn’t. I felt ashamed, disconnected, and overwhelmed.

In the middle of all this, I stopped taking care of myself. I put on some weight. I avoided mirrors, I avoided any kind of social activity more so because of the weight. I didn’t recognize myself physically or emotionally. I felt like I was wasting my life, feel like I wasted it now… 

Recently though, I’ve started to feel like I’m finally coming out of that hole — just a little by little. I’m starting to feel like me again. And now all the regret is hitting me hard. I miss my friends. I miss who I was with them. A few weeks ago, I reached out to two of them, apologising and explaining, and had a message with absolutely fair points, me missing important life events, no message even and zero nurturing that relationship, and just being gone and them not knowing how to reconnect back. I replied but never had anything back… which I get but still feels awful.

And now I just feel stuck in this ache. I miss them so much, and I just wish they would reply or something. Not sure what I can do or should do…. I know I wasn’t there. I know I let time go by. But it doesn’t mean I don’t care. It doesn’t mean I didn’t love them. I just didn’t know how to function back then.

Now, I’m here. Trying to move forward. But I feel so alone. And I don’t even know how to make new friends anymore, I basically have no one but my partner to say this to.

If you’ve been through something like this, I’d really appreciate hearing how you dealt with it, I feel like I have no one to say this to so here’s to Reddit "
Anybody else changed attachment styles shortly after the end of a relationship/friendship?,"For context- I took the attachment style test last year and my result came back as “anxious-preoccupied.” This didn’t come as a surprise to me and bc of patterns I’ve acknowledged over the years. 

Recently, I found myself in a one-sided dispute with a best friend, and have been struggling to decide on how to move forward with the friendship. 

I care about her, so I approached the situation sensitively and any attempts to communicate healthy have been concise and well thought of. 

On the other hand, I’m not receiving the same kind of respect that I’m giving out. She is refusing to take accountability for her actions, and seems to not even process any of my words with clarity. It’s frustrating to repeat the same things, only to be met with hostility. Especially when I only want to understand her better to adapt to a new version of what we have. 

I’ve taken a step back, since I’m not really sure what to do.

I’m an extremely empathetic person that readily accepts people’s faults, yet I’ve found myself in countless similar situations. As a social person, I often feel like stepped on and taken for granted, while giving more of myself and not expecting anything back. I developed this mindset bc my energy replenishes very quickly, and I never minded this imbalance. 

But now that I’m almost 30, I don’t have the same level of interest to being patient with everybody. I want to think about my own happiness more. 

It’s only been a few weeks since our ‘fight’  and at one point, I realized that this is probably the only moment in my adult life that I’m not actively in any toxic relationship. 

I feel calmer, and my senses aren’t constantly heightened anymore. Out of curiosity, I took the test again and resulted in being “securely attached”. Now, this was very strange to me. 

Some questions to ponder-
What makes a person securely attached? Are we already secure when we have a clear sense of who we are? 
But does allowing ourselves to be in toxic relationships trigger less ideal attachment styles? 
Do we only move to being secure once we accept the difficult decisions to leave good friends/partners behind, who may not be at the same level of growth as you? 

Lastly, if you care deeply about a friendship but know they have a lot of inner work that needs to be done, but you don’t know when they’ll even begin to do it. Would you bother to keep the connection and adapt, knowing you’ll have to pull the weight until then? "
"I’m a Dismissive Avoidant, and this is what confrontation feels like with someone I deeply care about.","Confrontation doesn’t scare me because I’m afraid of you… it scares me because I’m afraid I won’t be able to make you understand me. And when it’s you someone I care about deeply that fear multiplies.

It’s draining. Not because I don’t want to work things out, but because every time I try to speak, it feels like the words will come out wrong. I want to explain what’s going on inside me, but I feel like you’ll take it the wrong way… like you’ll think I’m cold, or dismissive, or that I don’t get you.

But I do. I understand you. I feel your emotions deeply, sometimes too deeply… and I want to respond in a way that makes you feel safe. But when the moment comes, my brain short-circuits. What I want to say never matches what I actually say. So I go quiet. I shut down. I nod along. I agree, not because I don’t have anything to say, but because everything feels too much.

I’m not trying to avoid you… I’m trying to avoid the shame that comes up when I realize I’m failing you emotionally. I don’t want to invalidate your pain. I just don’t know how to meet it in a way that doesn’t make you feel like I’m disappearing. There’s so much going on in my head… so many thoughts I want to explain, layers I want to unpack, reasons I want to give. But every attempt feels like it might come out wrong… or worse, hurt you more. So I say nothing.

And I hate that.
Because I want to stay.
I want to make things right.
I just don’t know how to do it without drowning.

I shut down not because I don’t love you… but because my nervous system goes back to that scared version of me. The one that learned it’s safer to be quiet than to be misunderstood. I retreat, not because I don’t care, but because I care too much and feel unequipped to show it. You deserve clarity, and I give you silence not because I want to hurt you, but because silence is the only thing that doesn’t feel like a threat when I’m overwhelmed.

I care about you, too deeply this is why It’s even worse. Because the guilt is heavier. The shame runs deeper. The silence feels colder. And I know I’m the one who brought it in. If I could explain it in the moment, I would. But most of the time, I only find the words once you’re already gone.

To anyone who’s been on the other side of this… I’m sorry. We don’t shut down to punish you. We shut down because deep down, we feel like we’ve already failed you. We return to that inner child who just wants to hide under the table again. Who doesn’t want to be seen not because we don’t want connection but because we’re scared it will slip through our fingers the moment we open up. 

We are not victims of the world… we are just cowards.

The truth is, we chose our darkness because it was easier. Choosing you would have meant facing our fear, and we weren’t ready. We weren’t brave enough. And no, we weren’t worthy of your love. Not because you said so, but because we let the darkness pull us in. The same darkness we kept calling solitude. We mistook silence for strength. We mistook distance for peace. And we convinced ourselves we were safer alone. But the truth is, we were just hiding from the kind of love that required us to show up. Because we are cowards."
