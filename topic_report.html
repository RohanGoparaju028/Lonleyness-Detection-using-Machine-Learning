<div class='post'><strong>Title:</strong> And so, I need to get some things of my chest.<br>
<strong>Post:</strong> *Every day I wake up, then I start to break up...*

  
Just for clarification - I'm writing this after 10 hour night shift in my country, and English is not my first language. 

  
Anyway, I feel empty inside for long time. I'm right now at the end of my studies... Went all without love. And you know what's worst? The thing that I was in love once. 

The story begins before the university. I knew a girl, who cheated on me. That's the important part - and the fact that her new boyfriend had to br...</div>
<div class='post'><strong>Title:</strong> I’m spiraling and don’t know what to do<br>
<strong>Post:</strong> 
(Sorry for the messy English, it's not my 1st language)

About 8-9 months ago, I (19M) walked in on my then GF in bed with another guy. Needless to say, this one event (and the ensuing messy breakup) did a number on my mental health and it took me a very long time to get back to where I was. I went on a healing journey, picked up some hobbies, stayed consistent at the gym, and I tried to expand my horizons a little bit. All to make me a better person and with the goal of becoming more desirable...</div>
<div class='post'><strong>Title:</strong> Sometimes I just don't know what to do<br>
<strong>Post:</strong> Kinda a bit lost 1/2

I'm 25 male Autistic living in Scotland. I have ended up being homeless partly through my fault but also partly parents are to blame. 

So since the age of 12 me and my parents been arguing non stop by the time I was 16 I came out as Bi/Pansexual kinda had a rough time my dad said I'm not gay until I have had up my arse and I came out to the rest of my family as I wanted to bring boyfriends home etc. My fathers dad then informs me I should be disowned verbal abuse and all s...</div>

<div class='post'><strong>Title:</strong> Life feels monotone and I think its starting to get to me.<br>
<strong>Post:</strong> I usually never minded it as much but recently I've just felt tired all the time. I'm not getting work done like I've used to. Always putting it off til late at night and then I do basically nothing for the whole day. And its the same shit every week too.
Just getting up and going to class, sitting down in my room. 

I'm always glad I left high school but everything after has never exactly felt exciting. Am I supposed to be enjoying life? I'm not, or atleast I think I don't. More like putting up...</div>
<div class='post'><strong>Title:</strong> I'm wasting away my 20s<br>
<strong>Post:</strong> hi, im new here but i didnt know where else to turn. i just desperately needed to put my thoughts into words and feel heard by someone, even if its just a bunch of strangers on the internet.

covid changed a lot of things for me, as it did for many of us. i didn't realize how good i had it until i let everything slip away. i had several different friend groups, hobbies that made me feel fulfilled, and a bright future ahead of me. i was a senior in high school, so we never got a real chance to sa...</div>
<div class='post'><strong>Title:</strong> Virgin 28M, never kissed or had a girlfriend<br>
<strong>Post:</strong> I just don't understand it. I don't understand it. I wish things had turned out differently. But here I am at 28 years old. I just wish I knew what a kiss felt like. I just want to be able to be intimate with someone. I just want someone to love me. Why is that so hard to find? My dad tells me "let her come to you, she'll come to you in time." But he's been saying that for the past decade. That's all he does. He doesn't actually help me meet people. Whenever I explain how I feel to him, he just ...</div>
<div class='post'><strong>Title:</strong> It's so discouraging when a doctor or therapist refuses to see you<br>
<strong>Post:</strong> This will probably be long...so I've been trying to get help again after about a year of not seeing any kind of professional and I've encountered one obstacle after another. I had recently tried going back to an outpatient program and that didn't go well but I'd like to stay on the medication they had placed me on. I've made several phone calls, trying to get an appointment with a new prescriber, and left messages but no place is returning my call. I went back to a community mental health clinic...</div>
<div class='post'><strong>Title:</strong> I just want romance, is this too much to ask?<br>
<strong>Post:</strong> God, I tried. Dating apps: Tinder, Grindr, Feeld, Bumble, Pure, you name them.

The constant swipes, people ghosting me, fake accounts, and so on. Available brain time. Commodification of people, to consume affection & attention. I fucking hate it.

I just want true real pure romance. Romantic love.

I am sick & tired of FWB, sex friends, fuck buddies, ONS, fuck that shit. I'm so tired to be seen and to see others just as fuck meats.

I know love is real: I have friends, family, art, my studies/...</div>
<div class='post'><strong>Title:</strong> 16M and autistic (high functioning)<br>
<strong>Post:</strong> im very lonely right now. i haven't had a gf in all of my life and i don't leave my house or even my room basically all day every day unless i have to go to school. i kid you not im listening to this rn [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOLmkjaciJQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOLmkjaciJQ) its a asmr comfort video, i know its kind of embarrassing but i really hate myself in the sense that i am unable to find someone that can love me. i hope that one day i can find someone that will and all i ...</div>

<div class='post'><strong>Title:</strong> Everything is becoming a trigger. What is happening to me?<br>
<strong>Post:</strong> 
I’m in a state of constant emotional pain, and I don’t know how to describe it. But I am having a weird problem- almost everything around me is turning into a trigger like "trauma" (? Loosely defining)

It’s not just memories — it’s everyday places, sounds, even foods. And it’s not just mild discomfort — it’s a flood of unbearable emotional pain, anxiety, and sometimes even physical symptoms like dizziness or feverishness. These “triggers” aren’t just reminders. They feel like the original pain...</div>
<div class='post'><strong>Title:</strong> Even if you feel deeply lonely, don’t settle for the only relationship you can get—especially if there are red flags from the start.<br>
<strong>Post:</strong> I’m a 34-year-old man, and in my life, I’ve only had one relationship. Strangely, I felt lonelier in that relationship than I ever did alone. Before we got together, we were friends—and during that time, I didn’t feel lonely. But the closer we became, the more we changed, and the more isolated I felt. That relationship came with many negative emotions.

In the early stages, I blamed myself for everything—even when she lashed out at me. I told myself I had no experience with relationships, that I...</div>
<div class='post'><strong>Title:</strong> breakup realisations: avoidant exes<br>
<strong>Post:</strong> i have been thinking a lot throughout my breakup and have made some groundbreaking realisations for myself. it’s been painful seeing that my ex is doing fine and feels better off without our relationship but i’ve been unnecessarily punching myself in the gut over the fact that they haven’t shown any sign of grieving or caring about the breakup, thinking that it had something to do with me.
 
i realised only moments ago that my ex with a slight avoidant attachment style, is probably unable to fee...</div>
<div class='post'><strong>Title:</strong> Been stuck in a 5-year on-and-off relationship with a fearful avoidant. She ghosted me again—after promising to meet. I need tools to let go.<br>
<strong>Post:</strong> Hi everyone,  
I’m (35M) coming out of yet another emotional spiral triggered by the same person—someone I’ve had a 5-year, on-and-off dynamic with. I have an anxious attachment style; she seems to lean fearful avoidant. It’s been a brutal cycle of closeness, withdrawal, promises, and disappointment.

Over the years, we’ve had moments of real connection. But also betrayals, unfaithfulness (even while we were supposedly exclusive), and emotional distance that never really healed. Despite all this...</div>
<div class='post'><strong>Title:</strong> To the people I love<br>
<strong>Post:</strong> **To the People I Love,**

I’ve been thinking about how to write this, and I keep starting and stopping because nothing ever feels like enough. How do you explain something that’s been quietly unraveling inside for so long? How do you say goodbye when all you’ve ever wanted was to keep holding on?

The truth is, I’m tired. Not just sleepy or worn out—I mean the kind of tired that sits deep in your bones. The kind that no amount of sleep, or sunshine, or talking it out can fix. I've tried to keep...</div>
<div class='post'><strong>Title:</strong> She said she wanted just friendship, but our conversations felt like emotional dating. I pulled away, but it still messed me up.<br>
<strong>Post:</strong> I (24M) got emotionally tangled with someone I had only casually interacted with before. It started off light—a random conversation, a spark—and led to regular texting. Not just small talk. I’m talking late-night messages, emotional vulnerability, subtle flirting. We weren’t together, but it started to feel like… something.

Then she told me she’d recently ended a relationship and wasn’t looking for anything romantic—just connection and friendship. I said I respected that, but the truth is—I alr...</div>
<div class='post'><strong>Title:</strong> Help? Trying to love myself...<br>
<strong>Post:</strong> This pain still feels unmanageable at times.
The loss of everything I ever wanted—everything I thought I had for a while—still hits hard. I’m doing the work, trying to heal, asking myself: “What makes me happy?” Not just as a father. Not just as a partner. But me—outside of her, outside of anyone else.
It’s hard to admit that chasing happiness through someone else—through making them happy—wasn’t healthy. Realizing I may have been used until I wasn’t needed anymore... that hurts in a way I can’t...</div>
<div class='post'><strong>Title:</strong> I disappeared during a hard time, and now I feel like I’ve lost everyone and just feel so alone<br>
<strong>Post:</strong> I disappeared during a hard time, and now I feel like I’ve lost everyone

I’m 30, and for the last couple of years, I’ve basically shut down. My mental health took a serious dive, and I stopped showing up — for people, for myself, for everything. I lost all momentum. My life became: home, work, home, work. I stopped going to the gym. I stopped answering messages and calls. I stopped doing… anything, really. No holidays, no adventures, nothing.

People would reach out, and I’d want to reply — I r...</div>
<div class='post'><strong>Title:</strong> Anybody else changed attachment styles shortly after the end of a relationship/friendship?<br>
<strong>Post:</strong> For context- I took the attachment style test last year and my result came back as “anxious-preoccupied.” This didn’t come as a surprise to me and bc of patterns I’ve acknowledged over the years. 

Recently, I found myself in a one-sided dispute with a best friend, and have been struggling to decide on how to move forward with the friendship. 

I care about her, so I approached the situation sensitively and any attempts to communicate healthy have been concise and well thought of. 

On the other...</div>
<div class='post'><strong>Title:</strong> I’m a Dismissive Avoidant, and this is what confrontation feels like with someone I deeply care about.<br>
<strong>Post:</strong> Confrontation doesn’t scare me because I’m afraid of you… it scares me because I’m afraid I won’t be able to make you understand me. And when it’s you someone I care about deeply that fear multiplies.

It’s draining. Not because I don’t want to work things out, but because every time I try to speak, it feels like the words will come out wrong. I want to explain what’s going on inside me, but I feel like you’ll take it the wrong way… like you’ll think I’m cold, or dismissive, or that I don’t get ...</div>
